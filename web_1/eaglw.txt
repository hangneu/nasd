	We are a blank check company incorporated
	on June 26, 2015 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition,
	share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have reviewed, and continue to
	review, a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination, but we are not able to determine at this time whether
	we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business.
	We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company
	is a &ldquo;shell company&rdquo; as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) because we have no
	operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.

	On September 16, 2015, we consummated our
	initial public offering (the &ldquo;Public Offering&rdquo;) of 50,000,000 units, including the issuance of 2,000,000 units as
	a result of the underwriters&rsquo; partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary
	share and one warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Class A ordinary share at a price
	of $5.75 per one-half share ($11.50 per whole share). The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating
	gross proceeds, before expenses, of $500,000,000. Prior to the consummation of the Public Offering, on July 1, 2015, the Sponsor
	purchased 12,218,750 Class B ordinary shares (the &ldquo;founder shares&rdquo;) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or
	approximately $0.002 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the Public Offering
	would be 42,500,000 units and therefore that such founder shares would represent, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the outstanding
	Class A ordinary shares under the Public Offering. On July 29, 2015, the Sponsor transferred 6,109,375 founder shares to Harry
	E. Sloan for a purchase price of $12,500 (the same per share purchase price initially paid by the Sponsor). On August 27, 2015,
	the Sponsor and Mr. Sloan transferred an aggregate of 25,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis to each of our independent directors
	at their original purchase price. On August 27, 2015, Mr. Sloan transferred 665,500 founder shares to the Sponsor. On September
	10, 2015, we effected a share capitalization of approximately .129 shares for each outstanding Class B ordinary share, resulting
	in our initial shareholders holding an aggregate of 13,800,000 founder shares. Following the Public Offering, an aggregate of
	1,300,000 of the founder shares (consisting of 1,271,771 shares held by the Sponsor, an aggregate of 9,705 shares held by our
	independent directors and 18,524 shares held by Mr. Sloan) were surrendered to us for no consideration due to the partial exercise
	by the underwriters of their over-allotment option.

	Simultaneously with the consummation
	of the Public Offering, we consummated the private sale of an aggregate of 19,500,000 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one-half
	of one Class A ordinary share at $5.75 per one-half share ($11.50 per whole share), to the Sponsor, Harry E. Sloan and the Company&rsquo;s
	independent directors (and/or one or more of their estate planning vehicles) at a price of $0.50 per warrant, generating gross
	proceeds, before expenses, of $9,750,000 (the &ldquo;Private Placement&rdquo;). The warrants sold in the Private Placement, or
	the private placement warrants, are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the Public Offering, except that,
	so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by the Company,
	(ii) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited
	exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the Company completes its initial business combination and (iii)
	they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.

	Upon the closing of the Public Offering
	and the Private Placement, $500,000,000 was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company acting

	restated memorandum and articles of association provide that none of the funds held in trust will be released from the Trust Account
	until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the redemption of the Company&rsquo;s public
	shares if the Company is unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering, subject
	to applicable law. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States &ldquo;government securities&rdquo;

	Our initial business combination must occur
	with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the
	Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at
	the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine
	the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
	that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
	We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders
	own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure
	our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets
	of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons,
	but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding
	voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required
	to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even
	if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to
	the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed
	to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial
	number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling
	interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately
	prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business
	combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the
	post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes
	of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test
	will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses even if the acquisitions of the target businesses are not
	closed simultaneously.

	Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to
	complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing
	condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders&rsquo;

	We may seek to enter into a business combination
	transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
	amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition
	and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public
	shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&rsquo;s
	&ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement
	relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause
	our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described
	above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate
	business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination

	we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying

	our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available
	financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target
	businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the
	time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be

	subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States
	&ldquo;government securities&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of
	180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
	Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted
	to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business
	plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner
	of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; within the meaning
	of the Investment Company Act. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earlier to occur of either:
	(i) the completion of our primary business objective, which is a business combination; or (ii) absent a business combination,
	our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our public shareholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If
	we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed
	to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses
	for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we are unable to complete
	our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive an estimated $10.00 per share on our redemption, and

	On July 1, 2015, the Sponsor purchased an
	aggregate of 12,218,750 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. The number
	of founder shares issued was determined based on the initial expectation that the total size of the Public Offering would be 42,500,000
	units and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the Public Offering. On July
	29, 2015, the Sponsor transferred 6,109,375 founder shares to Harry E. Sloan for a purchase price of $12,500 (the same per-share
	purchase price initially paid by the Sponsor). On August 27, 2015, the Sponsor and Mr. Sloan transferred an aggregate of 25,000
	founder shares on a pro rata basis to each of our independent directors at their original purchase price. On August 27, 2015,
	Mr. Sloan transferred 665,500 founder shares to the Sponsor. The foregoing transfers of founder shares were made in reliance upon
	an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to the so-called 4(a)(1)-&frac12; exemption. On
	September 10, 2015, we effected a share capitalization of approximately .129 shares for each outstanding Class B ordinary share,
	resulting in our initial shareholders holding an aggregate of 13,800,000 founder shares. Following the Public Offering, an aggregate
	of 1,300,000 of the founder shares (consisting of 1,271,771 shares held by the Sponsor, an aggregate of 9,705 shares held by our
	independent directors and 18,524 shares held by Mr. Sloan) were surrendered for no consideration due to the partial exercise by
	the underwriters of their over-allotment option. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business
	combination. In addition, the Sponsor, Harry E. Sloan and the Company&rsquo;s independent directors (and/or one or more of their
	estate planning vehicles) have severally committed to purchase an aggregate of 19,500,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable
	for one-half of one Class A ordinary share at $5.75 per one-half share, for an aggregate purchase price of $9,750,000, or $0.50
	per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete a business combination. The personal and financial interests of
	our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination,
	completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination.
	This risk may become more acute as the 24-month anniversary of the closing of the Public Offering nears, which is the deadline
	for our completion of an initial business combination.

	We may structure a business combination
	so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests
	or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company acquires 50%
	or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient
	for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction
	that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target,
	our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company,
	depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a
	transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital
	stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial
	number of new Class A ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of
	our outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently
	combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&rsquo;s shares than we initially
	acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target
	business.

	reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not

	disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the
	requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute
	payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important.
	We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier,
	including if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before

	Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act
	exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private
	companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class
	of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards.
	The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that
	apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such
	extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
	or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt
	the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither
	an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
	or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.

	We have been advised by our Cayman Islands
	legal counsel that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of

	and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability

	are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained
	in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court
	of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes
	upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For
	a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum,
	and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter,
	impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural
	justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to

	We have not paid any cash dividends on our

	condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to a business combination
	will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. As a result of an increase in the size of the offering pursuant
	to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act, on September 10, 2015, we effected a share capitalization of approximately .129 shares
	for each outstanding Class B ordinary share resulting in our initial shareholders holding an aggregate of 13,800,000 founder shares.
	Following the Public Offering, an aggregate of 1,300,000 of the founder shares (consisting of 1,271,771 shares held by the Sponsor,
	an aggregate of 9,705 shares held by our independent directors and 18,524 shares held by Mr. Sloan) were surrendered for no consideration

	shares were first separately listed on NASDAQ, through December 31, 2015, with the comparable cumulative return of two indices,
	the S&amp;P 500 Index (the dash line in the chart below) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (the long dash and dot line
	in chart below). The graph plots the growth in value of an initial investment in each of our Class A ordinary shares, the Dow
	Jones Industrial Average Index and the S&amp;P 500 Index over the indicated time periods, and assumes reinvestment of all dividends,
	if any, paid on the securities. We have not paid any cash dividends and, therefore, the cumulative total return calculation for
	us is based solely upon share price appreciation and not upon reinvestment of cash dividends. The share price performance shown
	on the graph is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.

	to which we sold an aggregate of 50,000,000 Units at an offering price to the public of $10.00 per Unit for an aggregate offering
	price of $500,000,000, with each Unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one Warrant. Each Warrant entitles the holder
	thereof to purchase one half of one Class A ordinary share at a price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per whole share). Deutsche
	Bank Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated acted as underwriters (the &ldquo;Underwriters&rdquo;).
	Our Public Offering did not terminate before all of the securities registered in our registration statement were sold. The Public
	Offering was consummated on September 16, 2015.

	underwriting discounts and incurred offering costs of approximately $790,000 related to the Public Offering. In addition, the
	Underwriters agreed to defer approximately $19,500,000 in underwriting discounts, which amount will be payable when and if a
	business combination is consummated. We also repaid $200,000 in non-interest bearing advances made to us by Harry Sloan
	to cover expenses related to the Public Offering. No payments were made by us to directors, officers or persons owning ten
	percent or more of our ordinary shares or to their associates, or to our affiliates. There has been no material change in the
	planned use of proceeds from the Public Offering as described in our final prospectus dated September 10, 2015 which was

	and legal services, securities registration expenses and exchange listing fees. These costs, along with paid and deferred underwriter

	All 50,000,000 Class A ordinary shares
	sold as part of the units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature under which holders of Class A ordinary shares may,
	two business days prior to the consummation of a Business Combination, redeem their Class A ordinary shares for a per-share price,
	payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest, less income taxes payable,
	divided by the number of then outstanding Class A ordinary shares. In accordance with ASC 480, &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities
	from Equity&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 480&rdquo;), redemption provisions not solely within an entity&rsquo;s control require the security
	to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all
	of an entity&rsquo;s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although we did not specify a maximum redemption
	threshold, our charter provides that in no event will we redeem our Class A ordinary shares in an amount that would cause our
	net tangible assets, or total shareholders&rsquo; equity, to fall below $5,000,001. Accordingly, at December 31, 2015, 47,646,408
	of our 50,000,000 Class A ordinary shares were classified outside of permanent equity. The Company did not use the two class method
	to compute earnings per share as the Class A and Class B shareholders share equally in the losses of the Company.

	Net loss per ordinary share is computed

	stock method. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding warrants for the purchase of up to 34,750,000 Class A ordinary shares.
	For all periods presented, the weighted average of these shares was excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per ordinary
	share because its inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. As a result, diluted net loss per ordinary share is equal to basic

	The Company, after signing a definitive agreement for a Business Combination, will either (i) seek shareholder approval of the
	Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose in connection with which shareholders may seek to redeem their Class
	A ordinary shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Business Combination, for cash equal to their pro rata share
	of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the
	initial business combination, including interest but less income taxes payable, or (ii) provide shareholders with the opportunity
	to sell their Class A ordinary shares to the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder
	vote) for an amount in cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated
	as of two business days prior to commencement of the tender offer, including interest but less income taxes payable. The decision
	as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of the Business Combination or will allow shareholders to sell their
	Class A ordinary shares in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety
	of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require the Company
	to seek shareholder approval. If the Company seeks shareholder approval, it will complete its Business Combination only if a majority
	of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. However, in no event will the Company
	redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In such case, the Company
	would not proceed with the redemption of its public shares and the related Business Combination, and instead may search for an
	alternate Business Combination.

	Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our

	new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a registration statement
	under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;), declared effective or do not have a class of

	extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election
	to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard
	is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth
	company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make
	comparison of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company

	29, 2015, the Sponsor transferred 6,109,375 founder shares to Harry E. Sloan for a purchase price of $12,500 (the same per-share
	purchase price initially paid by the Sponsor). On August 27, 2015, the Sponsor and Mr. Sloan transferred an aggregate of 25,000
	founder shares on a pro rata basis to each of the Company&rsquo;s independent directors at their original purchase price. On August
	27, 2015, Mr. Sloan transferred 665,500 founder shares to the Sponsor. On September 10, 2015, the Company effected a share capitalization
	of approximately .129 shares for each outstanding Class B ordinary share, resulting in the initial shareholders holding an aggregate
	of 13,800,000 founder shares. The closing of the Public Offering included an initial partial exercise (2,000,000 units) of the
	overallotment option granted to the underwriters. Following the Public Offering, an aggregate of 1,300,000 of the founder shares
	(consisting of 1,271,771 shares held by the Sponsor, an aggregate of 9,705 shares held by our independent directors and 18,524
	shares held by Mr. Sloan) were surrendered for no consideration due to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment
	option. In the event the full overallotment option is not exercised in full, a portion of the founder shares will be forfeited
	so they will equal 20% of the expanded equity capital of the Company.
