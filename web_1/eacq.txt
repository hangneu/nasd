	We are a blank check company
	organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 29, 2015. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital
	stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
	Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although
	we intend to focus on companies operating in the financial services industry. We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number
	of opportunities to enter into an initial business combination with an operating business. Accordingly, we are not able to conclusively
	determine at this time whether we will complete an initial business combination with any of the target companies that we have reviewed
	or with whose management we have had discussions, or with any other target company, or the likelihood thereof. We also have neither
	engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a &ldquo;shell company&rdquo;
	as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, because we have no operations and nominal
	assets consisting solely of cash and/or cash equivalents.

	Long-term

</B>
	The number of U.S. persons over
	65 years old as of the year 2015 is projected by the U.S. Census Bureau to double by
	the year 2060, and U.S. retirement assets have grown by a compound annual growth rate
	of 9.6% between the years 2009 to 2014. Aging populations, increased longevity and a
	decline in traditional employer-sponsored defined benefit pension schemes are placing
	enhanced emphasis on the private market to provide retirement and protection solutions
	to developed market populations. As of the year 2015, financial services represents 20%
	of U.S. GDP according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Federal Reserve
	estimates the total size of non-bank U.S. finance is $15 trillion, indicating the existence
	of a substantial market in non-bank financial services. In emerging markets, the preceding
	trends are further magnified by the substantial increase in wealth of large segments
	of the population, which is driving new demand for banking, insurance and wealth management
	products. We believe these demographic and macroeconomic factors create substantial opportunities
	for acquisition in a variety of industries and geographies.

	since 2011. Other technology related trends include the increased outsourcing of non-core
	business functions, enhanced use of customer data, and the use of algorithm guided investing

	Ongoing global
	regulatory regime changes and reforms create a changing landscape for current market
	participants.
</B>
	Following the global financial crisis, enhanced scrutiny and regulation
	of banks and insurance providers have prompted financial services companies to review
	business portfolios and realign strategic direction, creating an opportunity for non-regulated
	firms to play a bigger role in the lending and lending-related services, insurance, finance,
	and financial technology industries. We believe that these structural changes to markets

	We anticipate structuring our initial business
	combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity
	interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that
	the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet
	certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business
	combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
	otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
	under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns
	or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively
	own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business
	combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange
	for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target.
	However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial
	business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.
	If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction
	company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of
	net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based
	on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

	We believe
	our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we
	offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination.
	In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of
	our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs
	of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses
	will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering.
	In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts
	that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.

	Furthermore,
	once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial
	public offering is always subject to the underwriters&rsquo; ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions,
	which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to
	capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&rsquo; interests. It can offer
	further benefits by augmenting a company&rsquo;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented
	employees.

	Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection
	with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
	provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder
	is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking
	redemption rights with respect to more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as the &ldquo;Excess Shares&rdquo;.
	We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by
	such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force
	us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable
	terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO could threaten
	to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&rsquo;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the
	then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to redeem no more than 15%
	of the shares sold in our IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to
	block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a
	target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not
	be restricting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against initial our
	initial business combination.

	There is

	we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of

	The foregoing
	is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with
	their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders&rsquo; vote on an
	initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy
	card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved,
	the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As
	a result, the stockholder then had an &ldquo;option window&rdquo; after the completion of the business combination during which
	he or she could monitor the price of the company&rsquo;s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he
	or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation.
	As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would
	become &ldquo;option&rdquo; rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered
	its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&rsquo;s
	election to redeem is irrevocable on the redemption date at the time specified in the related notice.

	Any request
	to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date

	its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not
	to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or
	electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares

	&nbsp;Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with
	us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance
	or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24
	months from the closing of our IPO, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common
	stock on the date of such approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then
	on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then
	outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed
	by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or any other person. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount
	that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny
	stock&rdquo; rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that
	we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our
	public shares at such time.

	to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities,

	Under the
	DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received
	by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption
	of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our
	IPO may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth
	in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day
	notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation
	may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders,
	any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s
	pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred
	after the third anniversary of the dissolution.

	Furthermore,
	if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in
	the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, is not considered
	a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section
	174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution,
	instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination
	within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as
	promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price,
	payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of
	interest which may be withdrawn to pay franchise and income taxes and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses),
	divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&rsquo;
	rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law,
	and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders
	and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for
	claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares
	as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such,
	our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and
	any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.

	In identifying,
	evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other
	entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged
	buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive
	experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors
	possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will
	be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition
	of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption
	rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future
	dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place
	us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

	offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more
	than 20% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. We intend to fulfill the
	requirements of this Nasdaq rule even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the relevant time. Therefore, if we were structuring
	a business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of

	in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the

	available to us outside our trust account to fund our working capital requirements. On March 17, 2016, we issued a convertible
	promissory note to our sponsor that provides for our sponsor to loan us up to $1,000,000 for ongoing expenses. On March 17, 2016,

	be present inside a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount
	of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result
	of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or
	other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected
	risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even
	though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges

	may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held
	by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to
	remain stockholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders

	brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received
	by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore,
	if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in
	the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO is not considered a
	liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section
	174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution,
	instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.

	their warrants on a cashless basis during the period beginning on the 61st business day after the closing of the business combination

	upon such closing and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted
	in favor of our initial business combination. Accordingly, at December 31, 2015 public stockholders owning 18,816,357 shares sold

	that may be due or interest earned on the trust account) and we could still close a proposed business combination so long as a

	a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo;
	will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 15% of the public shares. Generally, in this context,

	Prior to our IPO, on May 4, 2015, our sponsor
	purchased an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share.
	On July 29, 2015, our board of directors effected a stock dividend of 0.2 shares for each outstanding share of common stock, resulting
	in 5,175,000 founder shares outstanding. On July 29, 2015, the underwriters exercised part of their over-allotment option resulting
	in 20,000,000 units issued as a result of our IPO at a price of $10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000 before
	underwriting discounts and expenses. As a result of the expiration of the underwriters&rsquo; option to exercise the remaining
	portion of the over-allotment, our initial stockholders forfeited an aggregate of 175,000 founder shares. The sponsor, our independent
	directors and their permitted transferees own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares. The sponsor purchased from us an aggregate
	of 6,750,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of our common stock at $11.50 per share, at a
	price of $1.00 per private placement warrant in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with our IPO generating proceeds,
	before expenses, of $6,750,000. We received net proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants of approximately
	$201,750,000, net of the non-deferred portion of the underwriting commissions of $5,000,000. The amount of proceeds not deposited
	in the trust account were $1,750,000 at closing of the IPO and such proceeds, together with $25,000 from the sale of common stock
	to our sponsor, were used to pay $517,145 for costs and expenses related to the IPO and $2,910 for formation, general and administrative
	expenses. In addition, interest income on the funds held in the trust account may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
	tax obligations. For a description of the proceeds generated in our IPO and a discussion of the use of such proceeds, we refer

	are under any obligation to loan us funds. The uncertainty regarding the lack of resources to pay the above noted expenses raises

	does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no

	&ldquo;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2014-15&rdquo;).
	ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management&rsquo;s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company&rsquo;s
	ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required
	to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company&rsquo;s ability to continue as
	a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective
	for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.
	We will adopt the methodologies prescribed by ASU 2014-15 by the date required, and do not anticipate that the adoption of ASU

	and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable.
	The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised

	new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company&rsquo;s

	by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Shares of common stock subject
	to possible redemption at December 31, 2015 have been excluded from the calculation of basic loss per share since such shares,
	if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. Weighted average shares were reduced for the
	effect of an aggregate of 675,000 shares held by the initial stockholder that were subject to forfeiture. As a result of the underwriters&rsquo;
	election to exercise part of their over-allotment option on July 29, 2015, 500,000 founder shares were no longer subject to forfeiture
	and are therefore included in the calculation of basic loss per share. At December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any dilutive
	securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common shares and then share in the earnings
	of the Company. The Company has not considered the effect of warrants to purchase common shares in the calculation of diluted loss
	per share, since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted loss per
	common share is the same as basic loss per common share for the period.

	The Company complies with the accounting and

	FASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold

	in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination

	&ldquo;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&rsquo;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2014-15&rdquo;).
	ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management&rsquo;s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company&rsquo;s
	ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required

	a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective
	for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.
	The Company will adopt the methodologies prescribed by ASU 2014-15 by the date required, and does not anticipate that the adoption

	Pursuant to the Public Offering on August
	4, 2015, the Company sold 20,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo;), including 2,000,000 Units as
	a result of the underwriters&rsquo; partial exercise of their over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000.
	The common stock and warrants comprising the Units began separate trading on September 22, 2015. The holders have the option to
	continue to hold Units or separate their Units into the component securities. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company&rsquo;s
	common stock (&ldquo;Public Shares&rdquo;), $0.0001 par value, and one-half of one redeemable warrant (&ldquo;Public Warrant&rdquo;).
	Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Each Public
	Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of an initial Business Combination or 12 months from
	the closing of the Public Offering, and will expire five years after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier
	upon redemption or liquidation. If the Company does not complete its initial Business Combination on or prior to the 24-month period
	allotted to complete the Business Combination, the Public Warrants will expire worthless at the end of such period. Upon closing
	of the Public Offering, there were 16,750,000 warrants outstanding, which include 6,750,000 warrants purchased by the initial stockholders
	and 10,000,000 warrants purchased in connection with the sale of Units related to the Public Offering.

	On March 17, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory

	In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection
	with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the officers and directors
	may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company additional funds as may be required. If the Company completes the initial Business
	Combination, the Company would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released. Otherwise, such loans
	would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close,
	the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds
	from the Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of such loans, inclusive of any loans under
	the March 17, 2016 convertible promissory note, may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price
	of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the
	Sponsor. The Company does not expect to seek loans from parties other than the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain
	of the officers and directors as the Company does not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
	against any and all rights to seek access to funds in the Trust Account.

	As of December 31, 2015, the Company had U.S. federal and state

	In assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management
	considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
	realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary
	differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred
	tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of
	all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of
	the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the period ended from April 29, 2015 (inception)
	through December 31, 2015, the change in the valuation allowance was $496,880.

	On March 17, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory note to the Sponsor that provides for the Sponsor
	to loan the Company up to $1,000,000 for ongoing expenses. On March 17, 2016, the Company borrowed $15,000 pursuant to the convertible
	promissory note. The Sponsor is not obligated to loan us additional amounts pursuant to the convertible promissory note. The convertible
	promissory note is interest bearing at 5% per annum and is due and payable on August 4, 2017. At the option of the Sponsor, any
	amounts outstanding under the convertible note may be converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock at any time on
	or prior to the maturity date at a conversion price of $1.00 per warrant. Each warrant will entitle the Sponsor to purchase one
	share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Each warrant will contain other terms identical to the terms contained
	in the Private Placement Warrants. As of March 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of this convertible promissory note is $15,000.

Additionally, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of the IPO.

With certain limited exceptions, the private placement warrants and the common stock underlying such warrants, will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.

	None of our executive officers or

	July 29, 2015 through the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation, we have and will
	continue to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial support and
	administrative services. Other than the described fee, no cash compensation, including finder&rsquo;s and consulting fees,
	will be paid to our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates prior to or in
	connection with our initial business combination. However, our sponsor, executive officers and directors, and their
	respective affiliates have been and will continue to be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
	activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
	combinations. Our independent directors review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers,
	directors or our or their affiliates.

	to remain with us after the initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements
	to retain their positions with us may influence our management&rsquo;s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business
	but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination
	will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements

	On May 4, 2015, our sponsor purchased an

	2015, our board of directors effected a stock dividend of 0.2 shares for each outstanding share of our common stock, resulting
	in 5,175,000 founder shares outstanding. On July 29, 2015, the underwriters exercised part of their over-allotment option resulting

</U>
	At the option of the Payee, at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, any amounts outstanding under this Note
	(or any portion thereof) may be converted into warrants to purchase common stock of Maker (&ldquo;
<B>
	Common Stock
</B>
	&rdquo;) at
	a conversion price (the &ldquo;
<B>
	Conversion Price
</B>
	&rdquo;) per warrant of Maker (&ldquo;
<B>
	Warrants
</B>
	&rdquo;) equal to $1.00.
	If Payee elects such conversion, the terms of such Warrants issued in connection with such conversion shall be identical to the
	warrants issued to Payee in the private placement (the &ldquo;
<B>
	Private Placement Warrants
</B>
	&rdquo;) that closed August 4, 2015
	in connection with the commencement of Maker&rsquo;s initial public offering that closed on August 4, 2015 (the &ldquo;
<B>
	IPO
</B>
	&rdquo;).
	Before this Note may be converted under this Section 5(a), Payee shall surrender this Note, duly endorsed, at the office of the
	Maker and shall state therein the amount of the unpaid principal of this Note to be converted and the name or names in which the
	certificates for Warrants are to be issued (or the book-entries to be made to reflect ownership of such Warrants with the Maker&rsquo;s
	transfer agent). The conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the
	surrender of this Note and the person or persons entitled to receive the Warrants upon such conversion shall be treated for all
	purposes as the record holder or holders of such Warrants as of such date. Each such newly-issued Warrant shall include a restricted
	legend that contemplates the same restrictions as the Private Placement Warrants. The Warrants and shares of Common Stock issuable
	upon exercise of the Warrants shall constitute &ldquo;Registrable Securities&rdquo; pursuant to that certain Registration Rights
	Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2015, between Maker and Payee.

	Transfer
	of this Note or Securities Issuable on Conversion.
</B>
	With respect to any offer, sale or other disposition of this Note or securities
	into which this Note may be converted, Payee shall give written notice to Maker prior thereto, describing briefly the manner thereof,
	together with (i) except for a Permitted Transfer, in which case the requirements in this clause (i) shall not apply, a written
	opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Maker in form and substance from counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Maker to the effect
	that such offer, sale or other distribution may be effected without registration or qualification under any federal or state law
	then in effect and (ii) a written undertaking executed by the desired transferee reasonably satisfactory to the Maker in form and
	substance agreeing to be bound by the restrictions on transfer contained herein. Upon receiving such written notice, reasonably
	satisfactory opinion, or other evidence, and such written acknowledgement, the Maker, as promptly as practicable, shall notify
	Payee that Payee may sell or otherwise dispose of this Note or such securities, all in accordance with the terms of the note delivered
	to the Maker. If a determination has been made pursuant to this Section 15 that the opinion of counsel for Payee, or other evidence,
	or the written acknowledgment from the desired transferee, is not reasonably satisfactory to the Maker, the Maker shall so notify
	Payee promptly after such determination has been made. Each Note thus transferred shall bear a legend as to the applicable restrictions
	on transferability in order to ensure compliance with the Securities Act, unless in the opinion of counsel for the Maker such legend
	is not required in order to ensure compliance with the Securities Act. The Maker may issue stop transfer instructions to its transfer
	agent in connection with such restrictions. Subject to the foregoing, transfers of this Note shall be registered upon registration
	on the books maintained for such purpose by or on behalf of the Maker. Prior to presentation of this Note for registration of transfer,
	the Maker shall treat the registered holder hereof as the owner and holder of this Note for the purpose of receiving all payments
	of principal hereon and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not this Note shall be overdue and the Maker shall not be
	affected by notice to the contrary. For purposes hereof &ldquo;Permitted Transfer&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as any transfer
	that would be permitted for the Private Placement Warrants under the Letter Agreement, dated July 29, 2015, among the Maker, the
	Maker&rsquo;s directors and officers and Payee.
