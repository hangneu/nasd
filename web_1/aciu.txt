	Our Business

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical stage
	biopharmaceutical company leveraging our two proprietary technology platforms to discover, design and develop novel, proprietary medicines for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding.
	Misfolded proteins are generally recognized as the leading cause of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#146;s disease, or AD, and Parkinson&#146;s disease, or PD, with common mechanisms and drug targets, such as Abeta, tau and
	alpha-synuclein. We believe that our large and diverse pipeline of seven therapeutic candidates, including four clinical-stage candidates and three diagnostic candidates, has the potential to drive a paradigm shift in the treatment of a broad
	spectrum of neurodegenerative and other diseases related to protein misfolding.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is currently an absence of reliable, early-stage
	diagnosis and disease-modifying treatments for widely prevalent neurodegenerative and other diseases associated with protein misfolding. AD is the most common form of dementia, with an estimated worldwide patient population of 47&nbsp;million in
	2015, which is expected to grow to 75&nbsp;million by 2030 and 132&nbsp;million by 2050 according to the World Alzheimer Report 2015. AD is typically diagnosed by neurologists and psychiatrists through a series of cognitive and functioning tests
	once symptoms are clinically present, resulting in diagnosis at later stages of the disease after irreversible loss of neurons has already occurred. Currently approved AD treatments include medications that only treat the symptoms of the disease,
	with limited clinical benefit. PD, the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affects an estimated 7 to 10&nbsp;million people. In PD, the use of symptomatic treatments, such as levodopa, is associated with the loss of control of
	motor functions in approximately 50% of patients who have taken the drug for 5 years or longer. There remains a significant unmet medical need for reliable and accurate diagnostics to enable early diagnosis and disease-modifying treatments that slow
	the progress of neurodegenerative diseases.

	platform. Crenezumab commenced Phase 3 clinical studies in the first quarter of 2016 and we believe it has the potential to become a
	best-in-class disease-modifying treatment for AD. Genentech, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche, or Genentech, is advancing crenezumab for the treatment of AD under a collaboration agreement with us, pursuant to which it is responsible for the
	clinical development of crenezumab, including the costs associated with seeking and obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals, manufacturing costs and sales and marketing costs. Under our collaboration agreement, we are eligible to receive
	payments from Genentech totaling up to approximately $340 million, as well as sales royalties. Crenezumab has received Fast Track designation from the FDA. The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new
	drugs that are designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs, as further described under &#147;Business&#151;Government Regulation and Our Regulatory Department&#151;Product
	Approval Process.&#148; In 2012, crenezumab was independently selected by the National Institute of Health, the Banner Alzheimer&#146;s Institute and Genentech for use in the first-ever AD prevention study, which serves as the cornerstone of the
	global Alzheimer&#146;s Prevention Initiative. While crenezumab did not meet its co-primary endpoints in its Phase 2 studies, the data showed promising signals of activity in patients with a milder stage of the disease.

	this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering together with cash and cash equivalents on hand (including the Anti-Tau
	Antibody Phase 1 Milestone Payment) to further the development of our therapeutic product candidates under collaboration agreements (ACI-35 and anti-tau antibodies), advance our other clinical and pre-clinical programs, and for research and

	The successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our
	products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. To manage healthcare costs, many governments and third-party payors increasingly scrutinize the pricing of new
	technologies and require greater levels of evidence of favorable clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness before extending coverage. In light of such challenges to prices and increasing levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new
	technologies, we cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any of our current or future product candidates that we commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of

	Third party payors
	may deny coverage and reimbursement status altogether of a given drug product, or cover the product but may also establish prices at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
	Because the rules and regulations regarding coverage and reimbursement change frequently, in some cases at short notice, even when there is favorable coverage and reimbursement, future changes may occur that adversely impact the favorable status.
	Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.

	clinical studies will require that we enroll a sufficient number of patient candidates. Studies may be subject to delays as a result of patient enrollment taking longer than anticipated or patient withdrawal. Patient enrollment depends on many
	factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, eligibility criteria for the study, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the design of the clinical protocol, the availability of competing clinical studies, the availability
	of new drugs approved for the indication the clinical study is investigating, and clinicians&#146; and patients&#146; perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies. In the Phase 3
	clinical studies of crenezumab, our collaboration partner Genentech will seek to enroll patients in the early stages of AD and it may be unable to successfully identify an adequate number of eligible patients.

	Genentech has not disclosed detailed information about serious adverse events associated with crenezumab either
	publicly or to us. However, at the 2014 Alzheimer&#146;s Association International Conference, it was reported that in the combined Phase 2 study populations, serious adverse events occurred at similar rates in patients treated with crenezumab
	(16.5%) and in patients given a placebo (11.9%). In addition, adverse events identified in the clinical studies of crenezumab initiated to date have included inflammation of the throat and nasal passages, urinary tract infections and upper
	respiratory infections. In addition, five serious adverse events were observed in three patients during clinical studies of ACI-35, although we believe that these serious adverse events were not related to the treatment. Acute pyelonephritis, or
	kidney infection, and dizziness were observed in one patient and sick sinus syndrome was reported for a second patient, and these were labeled as possibly related due to the close timing proximity with the last administration of ACI-35. In the third
	patient, urosepsis, or blood poisoning, and pyelonephritis were described and classified as unlikely related to the drug. A relationship between these serious adverse effects and ACI-35 cannot be ruled out, however. Non-drug related serious adverse
	effects observed during clinical studies of ACI-24 were acute chest pain, death due to Alzheimer&#146;s disease or myocardial infarction (heart attack), colonic cancer, wound infections and pneumonia. Occurrence of serious procedure- or
	treatment-related side effects could impede clinical study enrollment and receipt of marketing approval from the FDA, the EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Adverse events could also adversely affect physician or patient acceptance

	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or
	condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered
	from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or
	treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a
	life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or
	biological product or where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards
	clinical study costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may
	not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the
	manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug or
	biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

	We may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation for any of our product candidates, and even if we do, we may not be the first to
	obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively
	protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug
	any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.

	Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors or collaborators. To
	counter such infringement, we may be required to file claims against those competitors, which can be expensive and time-consuming. If we or one of our licensing or collaboration partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to
	enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid or unenforceable, or that we infringe the defendant&#146;s patents. In patent litigation in the
	United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness,
	obviousness-type double patenting, lack of written description, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO,
	or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. In addition, third parties may raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post

	review, interference and derivation proceedings as well as equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. Such

	Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs
	surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States prior to March&nbsp;15, 2013, the first to make the claimed
	invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. After March&nbsp;15, 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, enacted on
	September&nbsp;16, 2011, the United States has moved to a first-to-file system. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to
	the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the invention. The Leahy-Smith Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect
	patent litigation. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by the USPTO administered post grant proceedings, including
	reexamination proceedings,

	which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not
	covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Because we rely on our advisors, employees and third-party
	contractors and consultants to research and develop and to manufacture our product candidates, we must, at times, share our intellectual property with them. We seek to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary technology in part by
	entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, contractors, consultants, licensing and collaboration partners, and other
	third parties. These agreements typically limit the rights of these third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our intellectual property and trade secrets. These agreements also typically restrict the ability of third
	parties to publish data potentially relating to our intellectual property, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future may expect to be
	granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we may have the right to be notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of
	intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future, we may also conduct joint research and development programs that
	may require us to share intellectual property under the terms of our research and development or similar agreements. However, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade
	secrets or other confidential information or proprietary technology and processes or that such agreements will not be breached or that our trade secrets or other confidential information will not otherwise be disclosed. Despite the contractual
	provisions employed when working with these advisors, employees and third party contractors and consultants, the need to share intellectual property and other confidential information increases the risk that such confidential information becomes
	known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the product development of others or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements.

	We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and

	have adequate remedies for any breach, independent development or publication of information by any of our licensing or collaboration partners. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have
	insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating such trade secrets. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.
	Moreover, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent such competitor or other third party from using that technology or information to
	compete with us. A competitor&#146;s or other third party&#146;s discovery of our intellectual property would impair our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business.

	To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through extensive

	candidates do not ensure that later clinical studies will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical
	studies and initial clinical studies. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in

	In the United
	States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug
	purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sale prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any
	therapeutic class. Cost-reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare
	beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar
	reduction in payments from private payors.

	More recently, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and
	Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending,
	enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Health Care Reform Law,
	among other things, increased rebates a manufacturer must pay to the Medicaid program, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused,
	instilled, implanted or injected, established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must provide 50% point-of-sale discounts on products covered under Part D and implemented payment system reforms including a
	national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Further, the new law imposed a
	significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance were enacted, which may affect our business practices with health care practitioners.

	Moreover, other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States
	since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a
	targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate
	reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other
	things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to
	five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.

	Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under the U.S. federal
	Anti-Kickback Statute, it is possible that some of our future business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health
	Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.
	Moreover, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False

	Our business activities may be subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other

	influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an
	adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health

	and 38,577,042 additional common shares issuable upon the conversion of all of our outstanding preferred shares into common shares, excluding 5,300,000 of our common shares issued to Credit Suisse AG, Zurich in the CS AG Share Issuance. This
	includes the common shares in this offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately upon the closing of this offering without restriction, unless purchased by our affiliates. Approximately 64.2% of the common shares outstanding are

	this offering. To the extent outstanding options are exercised, you will incur further dilution. Based on the initial public offering price of $12.00&nbsp;per common share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
	prospectus, you will experience immediate dilution of CHF 7.57&nbsp;($7.75) per common share, representing the difference between our as adjusted net tangible book value per common share after giving effect to this offering and the initial public
	offering price. In addition, purchasers of common shares in this offering will have contributed approximately 33.2% of the aggregate price paid by all purchasers of common shares issued by us but will own only approximately 10.8% of our common
	shares outstanding after this offering. See &#147;Dilution.&#148;

	Swiss law allows our shareholders to

	Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants pre-emptive subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe to any new issuance of shares. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can
	attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. For

	Under Swiss law, a Swiss corporation may pay dividends only if the corporation has sufficient distributable profits
	from previous fiscal years, or if the corporation has distributable reserves, each as evidenced by its audited statutory balance sheet. Freely distributable reserves are generally booked either as &#147;free reserves&#148; or as &#147;capital

	55,396,042 common shares each with a nominal value of CHF 0.02 and no preferred shares) on its audited statutory balance sheet. The number of common shares referred to in the preceding sentence includes the number of shares to be issued in this
	offering from the 5,300,000 common shares issued in the CS AG Share Issuance. We expect the aggregate of these amounts (less the minimum issued share capital and legal reserve of together CHF 150,000) to represent the amount available for future
	dividends or capital reductions on a Swiss withholding tax-free basis. We will not be able to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders on a Swiss withholding tax-free basis in excess of that amount unless the Company increases its
	share capital or its reserves from capital contributions. We would also be able to pay dividends out of distributable profits or freely distributable reserves but such dividends would be subject to Swiss withholding taxes. There can be no assurance
	that we will have sufficient distributable profits, free reserves, reserves from capital contributions or registered share capital to pay a dividend or effect a capital reduction, that our shareholders will approve dividends or capital reductions

	complying with certain of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ. Swiss law does not require that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors. Our board of directors therefore may include fewer independent
	directors than would be required if we were subject to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(b)(1). In addition, we will not be subject to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(b)(2), which requires that independent directors must regularly have scheduled meetings at which

	the Board of Directors.&#148; As a result, our practice will vary from the requirements of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(d), which sets forth certain requirements as to the responsibilities, composition and independence of compensation committees, and

	Furthermore, in accordance

	5620(c), which requires an issuer to provide in its bylaws for a generally applicable quorum, and that such quorum may not be less than one-third of the outstanding voting stock. Our articles of association provide for an independent proxy holder
	elected by our shareholders, who may represent our shareholders at a general meeting of shareholders, and we must provide shareholders with an agenda and other relevant documents for the general meeting of shareholders. However, Swiss law does not
	have a regulatory regime for the solicitation of proxies and company solicitation of proxies is prohibited for public companies in Switzerland, thus our practice will vary from the requirement of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5620(b), which sets forth certain
	requirements regarding the solicitation of proxies. In addition, we have opted out of shareholder approval requirements for the issuance of securities in connection with certain events such as the acquisition of stock or assets of another company,
	the establishment of or amendments to equity-based compensation plans for employees, a change of control of us and certain private placements. To this extent, our practice varies from the requirements of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635, which generally
	requires an issuer to obtain shareholder approval for the issuance of securities in connection with such events.

	We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of 6,000,000 common shares by us in this offering will be approximately $63.4 million at an
	assumed initial public offering price of $12.00&nbsp;per share (which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus), after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. In
	addition, we received gross proceeds of CHF&nbsp;14 million in July&nbsp;2016 from Genentech related to our collaboration on the

	Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $12.00&nbsp;per share would increase (decrease) our net
	proceeds by $5.6&nbsp;million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We may also
	increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering. An increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 in the number of shares we are offering would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and
	estimated offering expenses payable by us, by approximately $11.2&nbsp;million, assuming the assumed initial public offering price stays the same.

	However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process, it is difficult to
	estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our research and
	development efforts, the timing and success of our ongoing preclinical and clinical studies or preclinical and clinical studies we may commence in the future and the timing of regulatory submissions. As a result, our management will have broad
	discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds. In addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue certain preclinical activities or
	clinical studies if the net proceeds from this offering and our other sources of cash are less than expected.

	Under Swiss law, any dividend must be proposed by our board of directors and approved by our shareholders. In addition, our auditors

	Net tangible book value is determined by dividing our total tangible assets less our total liabilities by the number of our common shares

	of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. An increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in the number of shares offered by us would increase (decrease) the total
	consideration paid to us by new investors and total consideration paid to us by all shareholders by approximately $11.2&nbsp;(CHF 10.9) million, assuming an initial public offering price of $12.00&nbsp;(CHF 11.72) per share, after deducting the

	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high, low, average and period-end exchange rates for the purchase of U.S.
	dollars expressed in CHF per U.S. dollar. The average rate is calculated by using the average of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank&#146;s reported exchange rates on each day during a monthly period and on the last day of each month during an annual
	period. On September 9, 2016, the exchange rate as reported by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank was CHF&nbsp;1.0235 to $1.00. In this prospectus, translations from CHF to U.S. dollars were made at this rate.

	We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging our two proprietary technology platforms to discover, design and develop novel,
	proprietary medicines for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding. Our lead product candidate is crenezumab, a humanized, monoclonal, conformation-specific anti-Abeta antibody that we
	developed using our proprietary SupraAntigen platform. Crenezumab commenced Phase&nbsp;3 clinical studies in the first quarter of 2016 and we believe it has the potential to become a best-in-class disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer&#146;s
	disease, or AD. Genentech, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche, or Genentech, is advancing crenezumab for the treatment of AD under a collaboration agreement with us, pursuant to which it is responsible for the clinical development of
	crenezumab, including the costs associated with seeking and obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals, manufacturing costs and sales and marketing costs.

	Two of our other clinical product candidates, ACI-24 and ACI-35, are being developed using our SupraAntigen platform and target AD through
	active immunization, where the immune system is stimulated to make its own antibodies against pathological proteins:

	costs related to research and development, by major development program for the periods covered by this &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; section. These research and development
	costs exclude employment costs, regulatory, quality assurance and intellectual property costs. With the exception of ACI-35, research costs that are subject to collaboration agreements typically have a limited amount research expenses since our
	partners bear most or all of the research and development costs. We have shown below our research and development costs associated with advancing ACI-35, the tau vaccine candidate that is being developed jointly with Janssen, since pursuant to our
	agreement we are required to provide significant research support for this program until the end of 2016. Our research and development costs for ACI-24 for AD and Down syndrome are expected to increase significantly in the coming years as we fund
	Phase 2b and Phase 1 clinical studies for ACI-24 in AD and ACI-24 in Down syndrome, respectively. Research and development costs for our alpha-synuclein PET tracer diagnostics program and other new discovery areas are also likely to rise
	substantially in the coming years.

	General and administrative expenses include personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services, and all other allocated expenses.
	Personnel costs consist of salaries, cash bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services, IT and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent expense related
	to our office and research and development facility. We expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, and those of any national
	securities exchange on which our securities are then traded (including the NASDAQ on which we intend to list our common shares in connection with this offering), additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative
	and professional services.

	selected purchases, which we effect in foreign currencies.

	We are subject to corporate taxation in Switzerland. In 2005, the Canton of Vaud granted us a ten-year tax holiday for all income and capital
	taxes on a communal and cantonal level commencing in fiscal 2005 and valid through to 2014. In 2005, under a ruling created by the Swiss Federal Government to encourage the creation of new enterprises, we were granted a tax holiday of nine years
	from inception. Both tax holidays expired on December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	We are also entitled under Swiss laws to carry forward any losses
	incurred for a period of seven years and can offset our losses carried forward against future taxes. As of December 31, 2015, we had tax loss carryforwards totaling CHF 29.1&nbsp;million. There is no certainty that we will make sufficient profits to
	avail ourselves of these tax loss carryforwards.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The corporate tax rate in the Canton of Vaud where we are domiciled is currently 22.5%.
	The Canton does from time to time, amend the level of taxation levied on corporations and there is no certainty that the tax rate currently in effect will not change in the future. At present, there are discussions on lowering the corporate tax rate
	in the Canton of Vaud to below 15% by 2021.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Value Added Tax, or VAT, is charged on all qualifying goods and services by VAT-registered
	businesses. An amount of 8.0% of the value of the goods or services is added to all sales invoices and is payable to the Swiss tax authorities. Similarly, VAT paid on purchase invoices is reclaimable from the Swiss tax authorities.

	Total revenues rose to CHF 20.5&nbsp;million for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016 from CHF
	14.4&nbsp;million for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015, an increase of CHF 6.1 million. The increase in revenues was principally attributable to an increase in collaboration revenues. Specifically, in the first half of 2016, pursuant to the
	collaboration agreement with Janssen for ACI-35, we received a payment of CHF 1.5&nbsp;million in January 2016 to cover part of our research costs associated with this program and a CHF 4.9&nbsp;million milestone payment. In addition, in June we
	recognized revenues of CHF 14.0&nbsp;million related to achieving a clinical milestone in our collaboration on the anti-tau antibody program with Genentech. The CHF 4.9&nbsp;million and CHF 14.0&nbsp;million milestone payments are non-refundable and
	there is no further performance obligation and, as a result, we recognized the amounts as revenues. As there is a performance obligation to the end of the Phase 1b clinical study which we expect will be completed in late 2016, we are recognizing the
	revenues related to the Janssen CHF 1.5&nbsp;million research contribution on a straight line basis through December&nbsp;31, 2016.

	research and development team. Pursuant to our collaboration agreement with Janssen for ACI-35, we committed to spend a total of CHF 13.8&nbsp;million over a two-year period starting in January
	2015 to help bring ACI-35 to the end of the Phase 1b clinical trial. Because the scope of the Phase 1b clinical trial was not agreed to until mid 2015, we spent less than CHF 1.3 million, excluding wages, on research and development activities
	related to ACI-35 in the first half of 2015. In contrast, in the six months period ended June&nbsp;30, 2016, research and development expenses totalled CHF 2.5&nbsp;million, excluding wages. Similarly, during the first quarter of 2016, we spent CHF
	1.9&nbsp;million on the ACI-24 programs, as compared to CHF 0.6&nbsp;million for the first six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015 while more than doubling the outlay on R&amp;D expenditures on new discovery programs from CHF 0.4&nbsp;million in the
	first half of 2015 to CHF&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;million in the first half of 2016. As we are in the process of transitioning from an early stage development company to a more mature company, we are having to make substantial investments to upgrade and
	improve our manufacturing infrastructure. As a result, in the six month period ended June&nbsp;30, 2016 we spent over CHF&nbsp;2.0&nbsp;million on manufacturing related initiatives, as compared to the CHF 0.8&nbsp;million we spend in the six months
	period ended June&nbsp;30, 2015. We have added a total of nine employees to our research and development team which has resulted in our wages and share based compensation attributable to research and development staff rising to CHF 3.3&nbsp;million
	for the first six months of 2016 from CHF 3.0&nbsp;million for the same period in 2015.

	30.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, an increase of CHF 8.8 million. The increase was principally due to collaboration and license revenues rising to CHF 38.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 from CHF
	30.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. In 2015, we recognized revenue from two collaboration agreements, including a $25 million milestone payment related to our collaboration with Genentech for crenezumab and a CHF

	Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, research and development
	expenses, compensation and related expenses, and other operating expenses including rent. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and
	accrued expenses. We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with a number of our product candidates in various stages of clinical development including co-funding ACI-35 to the end of the ongoing Phase 1b clinical study, material
	increases in spending on ACI-24 in AD to fund a Phase 2b study, ACI-24 in Down syndrome, our PET imaging candidates focused on alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 which we are developing together with Biogen and a number of research initiatives focused on
	neurodegenerative orphan diseases other than AD.

	We plan to continue to fund our operating and capital funding needs through proceeds
	received from collaboration and licensing agreements and through equity or other forms of financing. We may also consider entering into additional collaboration agreements and selectively partnering for clinical development and commercialization.

	substantially in the first half of 2016 due to the notification in late June by Genentech that the anti-tau antibody program had moved into Phase&nbsp;1 clinical studies triggering a CHF 14&nbsp;million milestone payment while receivables declined
	sharply during the same period in 2015 due to the receipt of the CHF 25.9 million upfront payment from Janssen related to the collaboration agreement on ACI-35 which was partially offset by the addition of a CHF 14 million receivable from Genentech
	related to the ED-GO milestone payment, (ii)&nbsp;our prepaid expense balances rising from CHF 0.4&nbsp;million to CHF 1.8 million between June&nbsp;30, 2015 and June&nbsp;30, 2016 while (iii)&nbsp;the amount of deferred revenues rose by

	We grant options at the outset of the award period with the options vesting over a four year period. In line with IFRS accounting principles
	for option awards, we are using the graded methodology to expense the fair value of the awards on a straight line basis over the four year vesting period of the options. Specifically, the accounting rules require us to recognize that four separate
	options with four separate option periods were issued. Consequently, in year one, we need to expense (i)&nbsp;the fair value of the awards issued in the first year, (ii)&nbsp;one half of the fair value of the awards to be issued in year two,
	(iii)&nbsp;one third of the value of the awards to be issued in year three and (iv)&nbsp;one quarter of the fair value of the options issued to be in year four. The result in the change in the way we expense options means that we are recognizing a

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical stage
	biopharmaceutical company leveraging our two proprietary technology platforms to discover, design and develop novel, proprietary medicines for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding.
	Misfolded proteins are generally recognized as the leading cause of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#146;s disease, or AD, and Parkinson&#146;s disease, or PD, with common mechanisms and drug targets, such as Abeta, tau and
	alpha-synuclein. We believe that our large and diverse pipeline of seven therapeutic candidates and three diagnostic candidates has the potential to drive a paradigm shift in the treatment of a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative and other diseases
	related to protein misfolding.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead product candidate is crenezumab, a humanized, monoclonal, conformation-specific anti-Abeta
	antibody that we developed using our SupraAntigen&#153; platform. Crenezumab commenced Phase 3 clinical studies in the first quarter of 2016. Genentech, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche, or Genentech, is advancing crenezumab under a
	collaboration agreement with us for the treatment of AD, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affected an estimated 9.0&nbsp;million people in the United States, the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Japan, China and India in 2013. Under this
	collaboration agreement, Genentech is responsible for the clinical development of crenezumab, including the costs associated with seeking and obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals, manufacturing costs and sales and marketing costs. We believe
	our collaboration with Genentech validates our technology and crenezumab&#146;s potential to become a best-in-class disease-modifying treatment for AD. We are eligible to receive up to $340 million in total payments from Genentech, as well as sales
	royalties. Crenezumab has received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are designed to treat a serious or
	life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs, as further described under &#147;&#151;Government Regulation and Our Regulatory Department&#151;Product Approval Process.&#148; In 2012, crenezumab was
	independently selected by the National Institute of Health, or NIH, the Banner Alzheimer&#146;s Institute and Genentech for use in the first-ever AD prevention study, which serves as the cornerstone of the global Alzheimer&#146;s Prevention
	Initiative.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If approved, crenezumab has the potential to treat the underlying cause of the disease and intervene at an earlier stage of
	AD progression, prior to irreversible neuronal damage. We believe that crenezumab is ideally positioned to be at the forefront of disease-modifying and preventive medicine. We believe the key advantages of crenezumab include:

	Phase 3. The results showed trends favoring crenezumab in the milder patient population. Notably, in an exploratory analysis, the high-dose crenezumab arm showed a non-significant slowing of cognition in the overall and mildly demented populations,
	which was statistically significant (p=0.036) with a 35% slowing of the rate of cognitive decline measured by the ADAS-cog Scale over 73 weeks in patients with the non-pre-specified milder cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score,
	or MMSE, of 22-26). The MMSE is a widely used test of overall cognitive function, which assesses memory, orientation and ability to perform simple tasks. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 30 (best) with a score of 0-11 indicating severe dementia, a
	score of 12-19 indicating moderate dementia and a score of 20-26 indicating mild dementia. Statistical significance is an indicator of the likelihood of an observed effect being due to the study drug rather than due to chance. The &#147;p&#148;
	value is the probability of an event occurring by chance alone. When the p value is less than 5% (0.05) the results are considered to be statistically significant.

	We use our two unique proprietary platform technologies, SupraAntigen (conformation-specific
	biologics) and Morphomer (conformation-specific small molecules), to discover, design and develop medicines and diagnostics to target misfolded proteins. These platforms are our engines for generating novel molecules that are designed to bind to
	their targets with high affinity and conformational specificity, meaning they are enabled to differentiate between misfolded proteins and normally-folded proteins. All of our product candidates and our development programs have been derived from our
	proprietary platforms. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD as well as other neuro-orphan diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and Huntington&#146;s disease, are all associated with
	pathologies that involve misfolded proteins. Research has shown that misfolded proteins are unable to carry out their normal functions and aggregate to form certain types of deposits such as Abeta plaques or tau tangles that damage brain tissue. Our
	SupraAntigen and Morphomer platforms seek to produce conformationally specific molecules in order to prevent or disrupt the formation of misfolded proteins. We believe that our proprietary platforms also have the potential to generate additional
	molecules for indications that relate to protein misfolding outside of neurodegenerative diseases.

	Protein folding and unfolding are important ways of regulating the protein&#146;s biological activity and cellular location. Misfolding of
	proteins occurs due to a breakdown of cellular quality control systems, and is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Research has shown that misfolded proteins are not only unable to carry out their normal functions, but also
	aggregate to form deposits in the brain that eventually lead to neuronal damage and cell death. The progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD, is linked to the misfolded conformations of proteins, such as Abeta, tau and

	The diagram above shows how, in today&#146;s understanding, misfolded proteins play a key role in the
	pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Typically, protein misfolding occurs during cellular stress, which can be triggered by many different causes, including oxidation and a lack of growth factors. A cascade of molecular events begins with the
	misfolding of single proteins within a cell that then continue to aggregate to ultimately form plaques and tangles. These misfolded proteins are then exported and spread to healthy cells nearby, causing normal proteins to misfold in a process known
	as seeding. This process eventually leads to cell death in various areas of the brain and is linked to a decline in cognitive function.

	The central challenge in targeting misfolded proteins for therapeutic effect is a product&#146;s
	ability to differentiate, or conformationally select, between a misfolded protein and a normally-folded protein. This ability to conformationally select for the misfolded protein prevents the therapeutic candidate from interfering with the function
	of the normally-folded protein, thereby reducing the risk of side effects.

	The key aspect of both our SupraAntigen and Morphomer technology platforms is conformational specificity, which we believe is central to the
	development of effective therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. Our SupraAntigen platform targets misfolded proteins through antigens displayed on the surface of liposomes which mimic the targeted pathological form of the protein. In a
	complementary approach, our Morphomer platform uses small molecular weight compounds to target the aggregation and seeding process, which prevents the misfolded proteins from aggregating inside the cell and the formation of new misfolded proteins in
	healthy neighboring cells through a seeding mechanism. Small molecules derived from our Morphomer platform, which we refer to as Morphomers, also promote disaggregation of already formed pathological protein aggregates.

	Current Treatment Paradigm for Neurodegenerative Disease

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Current diagnostic and treatment paradigms for neurodegenerative diseases are suboptimal. Diagnosis typically takes the form of observation of
	cognitive, functional and behavioral impairment and other symptoms of the diseases, which are generally only apparent after irreversible neuronal damage has already occurred. These symptoms are treated with medicines capable of providing cognitive
	benefit and functional improvement but fail to affect the progression of the disease. For AD, there are currently four approved therapies, all of which only provide modest efficacy in treating the symptoms of AD, while having significant side effect
	risks, and fail to address the progression of the disease. Despite these shortcomings, marketed therapies, such as Eisai and Pfizer&#146;s Aricept, have achieved peak annual global sales of approximately $4&nbsp;billion prior to loss of exclusivity.
	Similarly, in the treatment of PD, the current standard of care is intended only to alleviate physical symptoms. In both AD and PD, there are no approved disease-modifying treatments that slow or stop the course of disease progression.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Modifying the progression of the disease requires targeting the underlying biological processes that drive disease progression. Unfortunately,
	these processes evolve over the course of many years prior to manifestation of symptoms and a high percentage of neurons may be lost prior to clinical manifestation. Many of the failed clinical studies for disease-modifying treatments targeted
	patients with moderate stages of the disease, when irreversible neuronal damage and death had already occurred. This had led to the conclusion that early intervention is necessary to slow the disease progression and that disease-modifying therapies
	should be studied in patients with milder stages of the disease. As a result of this, in recent years, there has been a movement

	disease-modifying and preventative medicine due to its demonstrated efficacy in milder AD subjects and favorable safety profile. Unlike the current standard of care, crenezumab seeks to modify the course of AD by intervening at an earlier stage of

	PSP, ALS and Huntington&#146;s disease. We believe that the future treatment paradigm for neurodegenerative diseases will involve different disease-modifying treatments used at various points in the progression of the disease. One such combination

	Our research and development program is based on our two unique proprietary technology platforms: our SupraAntigen platform, which is our
	biological and immunological platform, and our Morphomer platform, which is our small molecule, chemical platform. These platforms are designed to generate antibodies and small molecules, respectively, which selectively bind to misfolded proteins
	which are common in a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.

	Our SupraAntigen platform generates humanized monoclonal antibodies and
	vaccines for use as passive and active immunotherapies that are highly specific for pathological, or misfolded, forms of Abeta and tau typically found in AD and certain other neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to the high target specificity,
	the generated antibodies clear the misfolded proteins from the brain without generating inflammation. This characteristic was clinically confirmed in the Phase 2 clinical studies of crenezumab, where a favorable safety profile was demonstrated.
	Similarly,
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	ACI-24

	Research has shown that misfolded proteins are not only unable to carry out their normal functions but that they also aggregate to form
	deposits commonly known as plaques and tangles that damage neuronal tissue and lead to cell death. Our SupraAntigen and Morphomer platforms seek to produce conformationally specific molecules, which are molecules that are able to differentiate
	between misfolded proteins and normally-folded proteins, and target misfolded proteins with minimal side effects on normally-folded proteins. We believe that our platforms can also generate compounds in indications related to protein misfolding
	outside of neurodegenerative disease, such as in glaucoma where aggregated Abeta peptides and tau proteins have been shown to cause damage to the optic nerve.

	induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, these data indicate that crenezumab enhances the uptake of neurotoxic Abeta oligomers
	by microglial cells, the resident immune cells of the brain, which normally respond to neuronal damage and remove the damaged cells for subsequent disposal and clearance from the brain.

	A challenge with agents acting to remove Abeta is the potential to induce inflammation leading to vasogenic edema, which is accumulation of
	fluid in the brain that can lead to headaches, loss of coordination and disorientation. The fluid can be seen clearly on MRI scans and is referred to as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormality-Edema, or ARIA-E. Crenezumab is engineered on an IgG4
	backbone, which was selected because IgG4 antibodies are associated with a greatly reduced risk of causing inflammation. As a result, crenezumab&#146;s IgG4 structure activates microglial cells to clear Abeta without producing inflammation and
	associated vasogenic edema, as demonstrated in the Phase 2 clinical studies. In contrast, ARIA-E and other inflammation-related side effects have been observed in other antibodies with an IgG1 backbone.

	Crenezumab has been studied in two Phase 2 clinical studies, the ABBY proof-of-concept study and the BLAZE biomarker study. These two studies
	enrolled a total of 522 patients. The purpose of these studies was to investigate whether crenezumab could delay cognitive and functional decline and reduce the accumulation of brain amyloid in patients with mild to moderate AD. The sample size of
	the studies was not expected to have adequate power to detect a modest but clinically significant difference between active medication and placebo at the 5% significance level (as is commonly the case in Phase 2 studies in AD). Instead, consistent
	trends across different endpoints and dose dependency are considered indicators of a response in this learning phase of development, with confirmation then sought in Phase 3. Both studies had two active arms: a low dose arm receiving 300mg
	subcutaneous injection, which is an injection administered beneath the skin, every two weeks and a higher dose arm receiving 15mg/kg intravenously every four weeks. The primary analysis was conducted at 73 weeks, after 68 weeks of treatment. Safety
	and tolerability measures included repeated MRI scans to assess for the development of Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities, both vasogenic edema and hemorrhages.

	The
	ABBY study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of crenezumab in patients with mild to moderate AD, with an MMSE score at screening of 18-26 points. 444 patients were enrolled
	into the study including 13 patients who were included in a safety run-in cohort to support the use of the 15 mg/kg intravenous dose, which had not been tested in Phase 1. Since these patients received active medication after the second infusion and
	were then no longer blinded, they were included in the safety, but not the primary efficacy, analysis. The remaining 431 patients were randomized separately to receive crenezumab, either subcutaneously at a dose of 300 mg every two weeks (low dose)
	or intravenously at a dose of 15 mg/kg once every 4 weeks (high-dose), with a 2:1 active:placebo ratio in each dose group. In the subcutaneous injection dose arm, 122 patients received crenezumab and 62 patients received placebo. In the intravenous
	dose arm, 163 patients received crenezumab and 84 patients received placebo.

	ADAS-cog 12 score includes an additional item of delayed recall, leading to a highest possible score of 80 points. On average, the score of patients with mild to moderate AD increases by 5 to 8 points per year.

	The CDR-Sum of boxes is an assessment of &#147;global&#148; (overall) function of the patient in daily life. The patient&#146;s performance in
	the six domains of memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care are assessed through interviews with the patient and caregiver. Each domain is scored from 0 (best) to 3 (worst) based on the
	level of impairment. The scores for the six domains are then summed up and the resulting score or &#147;sum of boxes&#148; ranges from 0 to 18, with a higher score indicating greater impairment.

	The DSST is a classic paper and pencil test used to assess a patient&#146;s processing speed in the so-called digit symbol substitution test
	during which the patient is asked to insert a symbol in place of a digit according to a scheme as quickly as possible over a set period of time. The DSST measures the number of correct symbols the patient inserts within the allowed time, i.e. 90 or
	120 seconds. A higher score demonstrates better performance.

	In the ABBY study, a positive trend in cognition was observed with a greater effect on cognition in patients with a milder stage of AD (MMSE
	22-26), although the study did not meet its co-primary endpoints in mild-to-moderate AD (MMSE 18-26) patients. There was no significant change in cognition in patients who received low-dose subcutaneous crenezumab. Results of an exploratory analysis
	of the high-dose intravenous arm demonstrated that patients with the mildest cognitive impairment at screening (MMSE 22-26) showed a statistically significant 35% slowing of the rate of cognitive decline over 73 weeks. The effect became greater over
	time, as shown by the increasing separation of the crenezumab (solid line) and placebo (dashed line) curves in the diagram below. The milder group was not pre-specified, meaning the group of milder AD patients was not identified before commencing

	amyloid load refer to the total amount of amyloid deposited in the brain. Each of these typically increases over time in an AD patient. Other endpoints included changes from baseline in other biomarkers (CSF, volumetric MRI), cognition (ADAS-cog12),
	global function (CDR-Sum of boxes), and activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL). Enrollment required florbetapir-PET positive scans, or patients who were amyloid positive. Ninety-one patients were included in the study.

	The primary end point of change in brain amyloid load by florbetapir-PET was not met, but the study was not powered to detect statistically
	significant results. When assessing the amyloid load, the amount of amyloid in a region of the brain is determined by comparing the amount of an amyloid tracer to that found in a region with little or no amyloid, such as the cerebellum or the white
	matter, usually in the cortex. Recent studies have shown that the variability from scan to scan in the same patient over time is much higher when using the cerebellum than with the white matter, making the white matter a more powerful point of
	comparison for use in longitudinal studies. The higher variability of the cerebellum may be due to difficulties in exact positioning between scans and higher background levels. Taking this into account, the exploratory analyses of the BLAZE amyloid
	PET results using white matter reference region were conducted independently by two laboratories, the Banner Alzheimer&#146;s Institute and MNI Laboratories. The analyses produced analogous results where a trend in the reduction of Abeta
	accumulation was observed in the high-dose arm.

	Crenezumab demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability in Phase 2 clinical studies even at high doses. Crenezumab&#146;s safety profile is
	especially reflected in a low incidence of ARIA-E (0.3%) in Phase 2 clinical studies. ARIA-E was observed in only one patient who received high-dose intravenous crenezumab in the ABBY study. No case of ARIA-E was reported in the placebo arm or the
	BLAZE study. Favorable pharmacokinetic properties coupled with a favorable safety and tolerability profile enables crenezumab to penetrate the brain more readily at therapeutically relevant doses. Since dose limiting toxicities are a potential

	placebo-controlled period (1.4% of the crenezumab-treated population). The overall rate of deaths is consistent with the background rate of death in the elderly AD population. There was no consistent pattern for the cause of death and none were
	considered by the investigators to be related to crenezumab. It was reported that 3.2% of crenezumab-treated patients developed pneumonia versus 0.6% in placebo-treated patients in ABBY and BLAZE, but the rate of pneumonia cases in

	ACI-35 is a vaccine candidate directed against another key component of the pathology of AD: phosphorylated tau proteins, or p-tau, found in
	tau tangles. ACI-35 is designed to stimulate a patient&#146;s immune system to produce antibodies against the misfolded and phosphorylated pathogenic conformers of tau protein that aggregate to create the neurofibrillary tangles that characterize
	AD. ACI-35 is the first vaccine candidate against phosphorylated pathological tau in clinical studies, and is currently in Phase 1b clinical testing in patients with mild to moderate AD. In 2015, we entered into a partnership with Janssen
	Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, for the clinical development of ACI-35 beyond Phase 1b.

	The dendrites and
	axons, or nerve endings, of the neurons contain an elaborate series of thin tubes, or microtubules, which serve to support them and transport nutrients down to the nerve endings. Tau proteins are a key component of these microtubules, and, hence,
	are known as microtubule associated proteins.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In AD, tau protein is misfolded, becomes hyperphosphorylated and aggregates into neurotoxic
	oligomers that ultimately form neurofibrillary tangles within neurons. The degree of tau pathology correlates strongly with the degree of cognitive loss in AD. Approaches to reducing the level of abnormal tau proteins and slowing their build-up in
	the brain are considered important targets for new AD therapies.

	Anti-tau Morphomers are small molecule compounds designed to inhibit tau

	length tau aggregates and intracellular target engagement by reduction of cellular, aggregated and phosphorylated tau. Importantly, research data show that our compounds reduce cytotoxicity induced by tau. These data were further confirmed by the
	reduction of misfolded tau in the brain and memory improvement in a tau disease mouse model. This molecule is expected to enter Phase 1 clinical studies in 2017 or&nbsp;2018.

	Scientists increasingly believe that early detection of neurodegenerative diseases is critical to enhancing the effectiveness of both
	symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies. As a result, therapeutic development for AD increasingly focuses on treating early stage disease to delay or prevent progression and to preserve the maximum amount of cognitive function before it is
	irreversibly lost. Most clinical studies now target mild stages of the disease increasing the need for accurate diagnosis that is independent of potentially subjective cognitive metrics. At least one study estimates that as many as one-third of
	patients in previous AD studies did not in fact have AD. Accurate and early diagnosis of AD is thus a substantial unmet market need, and diagnostic products will have a

	We are developing two diagnostic product
	candidates using our Morphomer technology platform. These product candidates are PET ligands, that are tracers that can be used to target tau and alpha-synuclein aggregates. In May 2014, we established a licensing collaboration for our tau-PET
	imaging program with Piramal Imaging. Our tau-PET imaging agent is currently in a First-in-Man clinical study. Piramal Imaging is expecting to advance this program into Phase 1 clinical development in 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our PET tracers are designed to bind specifically to tau tangles and have demonstrated their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The
	severity of cognitive impairment in AD patients is correlated with the presence of tau protein tangles, leading us to believe that an imaging agent for tau is equally important. Our tau-PET tracers are more selective for tau than Abeta when compared
	to current published tau-PET agents in development and can be readily radiolabelled. While PET imaging has improved the diagnosis of AD by targeting Abeta, tau imaging will further enhance the diagnosis of early AD. To date, there are no approved
	tau tracers.

	Alongside our AD diagnostics activities, we have a program targeting PET imaging agents for alpha-synuclein, an important protein involved in
	PD, and which progressively accumulates in structures in the PD brain. Scientists believe that the misfolding of alpha-synuclein is central to the neurodegenerative process of PD, as well as a number of other disorders, collectively called
	synucleinopathies, such as Lewy Body Dementia and Multiple System Atrophy, making it a priority target for drug development. We have identified molecules from our Morphomer library that stain selectively alpha-synuclein pathological structures in
	human PD brain sections. Ongoing work to optimize the potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetics of these tracers is being funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#146;s Research and Biogen under the non-exclusive research and

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our strategy to date has been to focus on identifying partnerships for our early stage product candidates as both a way to secure non-dilutive
	capital to fund our other research and development programs but also as a way to accelerate the development of these partnered products by leveraging our partners&#146; extensive knowledge in clinical studies, drug development, manufacturing and
	commercialization.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	With greater financial resources at our disposal but also given the significant knowledge acquired by our scientists
	and scientific leadership, we intend to retain selected promising product candidates in-house for a longer period of time and fund their development from our own resources. This will allow us to generate greater value from these product candidates,
	allowing us to demand more significant terms from a prospective partner. For example, our current plan is to retain full control of our two Abeta vaccine programs focused on AD and Down syndrome, meaning that we would fund the planned Phase 2 and
	Phase 2/3 studies, respectively, from our financial resources. In the field of diagnostics, the parallel development of therapeutic compounds and companion diagnostics is of growing importance to the pharmaceutical industry. The development
	timeframe of a PET diagnostic agent is significantly shorter than for a therapeutic product providing the prospect for potential diagnostic product revenues to be realized quicker than potential therapeutic product revenues. Our Morphomer platform
	is particularly well suited to generate molecules for use in the development of companion diagnostics.

	Given our current stage of product
	development, we currently do not have a commercialization infrastructure. If any of our diagnostic product candidates is granted marketing approval, we intend to focus our initial commercial efforts in the United States and select European markets,
	which we believe represent the largest market opportunities for us. In those markets, we expect our commercial operations to include our own specialty sales force that will target neurologists and gerontologists, both in hospitals and in private
	practice. In other markets, we expect to seek partnerships that would maximize our products&#146; commercial potential.

	We have established, with each contract manufacturing organization supplying drug substances or drug products, quality agreements
	and master service agreements. Quality agreements define the quality standards required to develop, produce and supply the product. Quality agreements also define the responsibilities related to the collaboration with regards to the quality related
	aspects. Master service agreements define the framework under which the quality agreements operate. Any failure to achieve and maintain compliance with the laws, regulations and standards, suspension of the manufacturing of our product candidates or
	revoke of cGMP permissions which would adversely affect our business and reputation are defined in the master service agreements and quality agreements. The risk that any third-party providers may breach the agreements they have with us because of
	factors beyond our control and the possibility they may also terminate or refuse to renew their agreements because of their own financial difficulties or business priorities, potentially at a time that is costly or otherwise inconvenient for us is
	managed by us with constant investments toward maintaining reserve stocks and in-depth process know-how. The latter is supported by continuous in-house process development and production activities of small-scale/research grade materials that may
	offer the chance to rapidly identify alternative contract manufacturers to which the manufacturing process could be transferred providing continuity for the clinical study.

	The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new

	the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. AD, for example, meets
	both pre-requisites&#151;it is life-threatening and constitutes an unmet medical need. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is

	effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor
	of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or the inability to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, may allow
	the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial
	launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

	The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 also amended the FDCA to require FDA to expedite the development and review

	over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, FDA shall act to
	expedite the development and review of the product&#146;s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product&#146;s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather
	nonclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient

	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and
	effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Recently, the Food and Drug
	Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law on July&nbsp;9, 2012, amended the FDCA. FDASIA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a
	new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA.
	The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such
	detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the
	PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development
	programs.

	The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, NDAs are subject
	to substantial application user fees and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The
	FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA&#146;s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2016, the user fee for each NDA application requiring clinical data is $2,374,200. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee
	for drugs ($114,450), and an annual establishment fee ($585,200) on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first
	application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.

	Once the NDA submission has been submitted, the FDA has 60 days after submission of the NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether
	it is sufficient to accept for filing. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA sets a goal date by which it plans to complete its review. This is typically 12 months from the date of submission of the NDA application. The review
	process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing
	facility complies with cGMPs and may also inspect clinical study sites for integrity of data supporting safety and efficacy. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to
	risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical study data. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations in making its decisions. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable
	regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.

	After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced,
	it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle
	of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and
	time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could
	also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods,
	patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market
	studies or clinical studies. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.

	The FDA and an IND sponsor may agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of a claim of
	effectiveness in an NDA. This process is known as a special protocol assessment, or SPA. Upon a specific request for a SPA by an IND sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol. If a SPA agreement is reached, however, it is not a guarantee of
	product approval by the FDA or approval of any permissible claims about the product. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of
	the SPA agreement. In particular, the SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if previously unrecognized public health concerns later come to light, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, the IND sponsor fails to

	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition,
	which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the US there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the
	US for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and
	its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such
	designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited
	circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax
	advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the
	orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is
	determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be
	entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits in that jurisdiction.

	Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible
	for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term to be extended up to five years as compensation for patent
	term effectively lost due to the FDA&#146;s pre-market approval requirements. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration
	period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any
	time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration
	of the patent and within a 60 day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or
	restoration. Where a product contains multiple active ingredients, if any one active ingredient has not been previously approved, it can form the basis of an extension of patent term provided the patent claims that ingredient or the combination.

	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The
	specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity never previously approved by the
	FDA either alone or in combination. For a new chemical entity that was issued orphan drug designation, the FDCA provides marketing exclusivity for the &#147;same drug&#148; and &#145;&#145;same indication&#146;&#146; for a period of seven years. A
	drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the compound responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept
	for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing
	NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability trials, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or
	strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and
	three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical trials and adequate and
	well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

	immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases; for veterinary medicines for use as growth or yield enhancers;
	for medicines derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; for advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines; and for officially designated &#145;orphan medicines&#146;
	(medicines used for rare human diseases). The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical
	innovation or for products which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. The National MA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for
	marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be
	approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of
	which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States do not raise objections, the product is granted a national MA in all the Member States where the
	authorization was sought. Before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety
	and efficacy.

	As is the case in the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant
	regulatory controls. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended (and which will be replaced from May 2016 or later by Regulation (EU) No 536/2014) provides a system for the approval of clinical studies in the European Union via
	implementation through national legislation of the Member States. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authorities of the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, a
	clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by
	the Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. A clinical trial may only be undertaken if provision has been made for insurance or indemnity to cover the
	liability of the investigator or sponsor. In certain countries, the sponsor of a clinical trial has a strict (faultless) liability for any (direct or indirect) damage suffered by trial subjects. The sponsor of a clinical trial, or its legal
	representative, must be based in the European Economic Area. European regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of adverse event reports during a study and a copy of the final study report.

	Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;726/2004, as amended, the centralized procedure is mandatory
	for drugs developed by means of specified biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products, drugs for human use containing a new active substance for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of specified diseases, including
	but not limited to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, as well as drugs designated as orphan drugs. The CHMP also has the discretion to permit other products to use

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the marketing
	authorization application, or MAA, the applicant has to properly and sufficiently demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug. Under the centralized approval procedure, the CHMP, possibly in conjunction with other committees, is
	responsible for drawing up the opinion of the EMA on any matter concerning the admissibility of the files submitted in accordance with the centralized procedure, such as an opinion on the granting, variation, suspension or revocation of a marketing
	authorization, and pharmacovigilance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The CHMP and other committees are also responsible for providing guidelines and have published
	numerous guidelines that may apply to our product candidates. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of drug products and may include, among other things,
	the pre-clinical studies required in specific cases; and the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse
	reactions. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any of our product candidates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the CHMP under the centralized procedure is 210 days after receipt of a valid
	application. This period will be suspended until such time as the supplementary information requested by the CHMP, has been provided by the applicant. Likewise, this time-limit will be suspended for the time allowed for the applicant to prepare oral
	or written explanations. When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug which is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the
	applicant may request an accelerated assessment procedure. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time-limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time-limit for the centralized procedure
	if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.

	If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and
	efficacy of the product are sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. This is sent to the European Commission which drafts a decision. After consulting with the Member States, the European Commission adopts a decision and grants a marketing
	authorization, which is valid for the whole of the European Economic Area, or EEA. The marketing authorization may be subject to certain conditions, which may include, without limitation, the performance of post-authorization safety and/or efficacy
	studies.

	European Union legislation also provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of
	Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;726/2004, as amended, and Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package benefit from eight years
	of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#146;s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application. During the
	additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#146;s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity.
	The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder, or MAH, obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which,
	during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the

	In the European Union, the pricing and reimbursement mechanisms by private and public health insurers vary largely by country and even within
	countries. The public systems reimbursement for standard drugs is determined by guidelines established by the legislator or responsible national authority. The approach taken varies by Member State. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative
	list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict
	reimbursement. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products and some of EU countries require
	the completion of studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan drugs.
	Inclusion of orphan drugs in reimbursement systems tend to focus on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any drug. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come
	with cost, use and often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country. In addition, results based rules of reimbursement may apply.

	credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply
	to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities
	from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for a statutory exception or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be
	intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe
	harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts
	have interpreted the statute&#146;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and
	Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, PPACA, amended the intent requirement under the Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes (discussed below) such that a person or
	entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or the specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting
	from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Further, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity
	that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

	The federal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a
	false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a
	modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes &#147;any request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been
	prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to
	be submitted because of the companies&#146; marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit
	knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any
	materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services.

	In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our
	business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually
	identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#146;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates&#151;independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected
	health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates,
	and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#146;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition,
	state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

	In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any approved products will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate
	reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing
	the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products, if approved, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a
	significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our products will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors. These third-party payors
	are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.

	In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates. The
	market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors&#146; drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement.
	The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict
	patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a
	time-consuming, costly and sometimes unpredictable process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may
	need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating
	results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payor-by-payor basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payor does

	Company will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payor. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product

	Furthermore, in many foreign
	countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The
	requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide
	reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company
	placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of

	may be held. Under Swiss law, an ordinary general meeting of shareholders must be held annually within six months after the end of a corporation&#146;s financial year. In our case, this generally means on or before June&nbsp;30, although in 2016 we
	expect to hold our ordinary general meeting in November, which we believe is permissible under Swiss law as the investors acquiring shares in this offering will be permitted to participate in such ordinary general meeting.

	On January&nbsp;1, 2013, treaties on final withholding taxes of Switzerland with the United Kingdom and Austria entered into force (each, a
	&#147;Contracting State&#148;). The treaties require a Swiss paying agent, as defined in the treaties, to levy a flat-rate final withholding tax (
<I>
	imp&ocirc;t lib&eacute;ratoire
</I>
	) at rates specified in the treaties on certain capital gains and
	income items (interest, dividends, other income items, all as defined in the treaties), deriving from assets, including the Shares, held in accounts or deposits with a Swiss paying agent by (i)&nbsp;an individual resident in a Contracting State or,
	(ii)&nbsp;if certain requirements are met, by a domiciliary company (
<I>
	soci&eacute;t&eacute; de domicile
</I>
	), an insurance company in connection with a so-called insurance wrapper (
<I>
	contrat d&#146;assurance vie utilis&eacute; comme
	enveloppe
</I>
	) or other individuals if the beneficial owner is an individual resident in a Contracting State. The flat-rate tax withheld substitutes the ordinary income tax on the respective capital gains and income items in the Contracting State
	where the individual is tax resident. In order to avoid the withholding of the flat-rate tax by the Swiss paying agent, such individuals may opt for a disclosure of the respective capital gains and income items to the tax authorities of the
	Contracting State where they are tax residents. If Swiss federal withholding tax of 35% has been withheld on dividends, the Swiss paying agent will&#151;to the extent provided in the applicable bilateral treaty for the avoidance of double taxation
	between Switzerland and the Contracting State&#151;in its own name and on behalf of the relevant shareholder file with the Swiss tax authorities a request for the partial refund of the Swiss federal withholding tax. The Swiss federal withholding
	tax, which is not refundable according to the bilateral tax treaty (residual tax), is credited against the flat-rate final withholding tax. Switzerland may conclude similar treaties with other European countries.

	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the common shares in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to
	close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. If the
	underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the
	underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering.

	the federal and state securities laws of the United States. Original actions against persons in Switzerland based solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws are governed, among other things, by the principles set forth in the Swiss
	Federal Act on Private International Law. This statute provides that the application of provisions of non-Swiss law by the courts in Switzerland shall be precluded if the result would be incompatible with Swiss public policy. Also, mandatory

	AC Immune SA (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical
	company leveraging our two proprietary technology platforms to discover, design and develop novel, proprietary medicines for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding. Misfolded proteins are
	generally recognized as the leading cause of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#146;s disease, or AD, and Parkinson&#146;s disease, or PD, with common mechanisms and drug targets, such as Abeta, tau and alpha-synuclein. Our lead product
	candidate is crenezumab, a humanized, monoclonal, conformation-specific anti-Abeta antibody that the Company developed using our proprietary SupraAntigen platform. Phase 3 clinical studies for crenezumab were commenced in early 2016. The Company
	uses two unique proprietary platform technologies, SupraAntigen (conformation-specific biologics) and Morphomer (conformation-specific small molecules); to discover, design and develop medicines and diagnostics to target misfolded proteins.

	payment from AC Immune to a third party.&nbsp;The Company received the proceeds from this milestone payment in July 2016.&nbsp;Pursuant to the exclusive global license agreement, there is no further performance obligation attached to this payment,

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we

	included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	AC Immune SA (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical
	company leveraging our two proprietary technology platforms to discover, design and develop novel, proprietary medicines for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding. Misfolded proteins are
	generally recognized as the leading cause of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#146;s disease, or AD, and Parkinson&#146;s disease, or PD, with common mechanisms and drug targets, such as Abeta, tau and alpha-synuclein. Our lead product
	candidate is crenezumab, a humanized, monoclonal, conformation-specific anti-Abeta antibody that we developed using our proprietary SupraAntigen platform. Crenezumab is expected to enter Phase&nbsp;3 clinical studies in early 2016 and we believe it
	has the potential to become a best-in-class disease-modifying treatment for AD. We use our two unique proprietary platform technologies, SupraAntigen (conformation-specific biologics) and Morphomer (conformation-specific small molecules), to
	discover, design and develop medicines and diagnostics to target misfolded proteins.

	settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. If required, deferred taxation is provided in full using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the reporting dates. It
	is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when it is anticipated the liabilities will be settled, and it is based on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

	Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary
	differences can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Although the Company has substantial tax loss
	carryforwards, historically, due to the fact that the Company had limited certainty on key milestones, it has not recognized any deferred tax assets.

	The Company presents basic earnings

	share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities such as share options were vested or exercised into common shares or resulted in the issuance of common shares that would participate in net income. Anti-dilutive shares
	are excluded from basic and dilutive earnings per share calculation.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November 2006, AC Immune signed an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement for crenezumab, our humanized monoclonal antibody targeting misfolded Abeta in
	July 2015, Genentech announced it will commence Phase&nbsp;3 clinical studies for crenezumab in 2016. If crenezumab receives regulatory approval, we will be entitled to receive royalties that are tied to annual sales volumes with different royalty
	rates applicable in the U.S. and Europe. These percentage rates range from net high single digits to the mid-teens.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the agreement with Genentech,
	we may become eligible to receive payments totaling up to approximately $340 million, excluding royalties. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 we have received total payments of $65 million (CHF 70.1 million): $40 million (CHF 45.8 million) were received
	in three milestone payments prior to 2013 and $25 million (CHF 24.3 million) were received in July 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We recognized the Phase 3 payment in our

	Genentech may terminate the agreement at any time by providing three months&#146; notice to us. In such event all costs incurred are still refundable.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2012, we entered into a second partnership with Genentech to commercialize our anti-tau antibodies for use as immunotherapeutics. The value of this
	exclusive, worldwide alliance is potentially greater than CHF 400&nbsp;million and includes upfront and milestone payments. In addition to milestones, we will be eligible to receive royalties on sales at a percentage rate ranging from the mid-single
	digits to high single digits. The agreement also provides for collaboration on two additional indications built on the same anti-tau antibody program as well as a potential anti-tau diagnostic product.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To date we have received payments totaling CHF 31&nbsp;million including a CHF 14&nbsp;million milestone payment received in 2015. In June 2015, the Company
	recognized as revenue a milestone payment of CHF 14&nbsp;million as there is no further performance obligation. This milestone was due upon the ED-GO decision by Genentech on the anti-tau antibody&#146;s product in AD. At the same time, Genentech
	announced that it intends to move the anti-tau antibody program into Phase&nbsp;1 clinical studies in late 2016.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December of 2014, we entered into a partnership with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson company, to develop and commercialize therapeutic
	anti-tau vaccines for the treatment of AD and potentially other tauopathies. The partnership includes a worldwide exclusive license and research collaboration. We and Janssen will co-develop the lead therapeutic vaccine, ACI-35, through Phase 1b
	completion. From Phase 2 and onward, Janssen will assume responsibility for the clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of ACI-35. ACI-35 is an active therapeutic vaccine stimulating the patient&#146;s immune system to produce a
	polyclonal antibody response against phosphorylated tau protein.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The agreement also allows for the collaboration to be expanded to a second indication
	based on the same anti-tau vaccine program and intellectual property related to this program.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We received an upfront payment of CHF 25.9&nbsp;million
	which we recognized in 2014 and are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments for AD and a potential second indication outside of AD. Additionally, we will receive royalties on sales at a percentage rate
	ranging from the low double digits to mid-teens. The two companies have entered into a three-year joint research collaboration to further characterize and develop novel vaccine therapies for the treatment of tauopathies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:18PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As part of this agreement, AC Immune has committed to spending CHF 13.8&nbsp;million in research and development to the end of Phase 1b which is currently
	anticipated at the end of 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, Janssen may terminate the agreement at any time after completion of the Phase 1b clinical study by providing 90 days&#146; notice to us.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The recognition of the upfront payment from Janssen was recorded at the time of receipt as the Company determined that the license granted to Janssen was a
	separate, non-contingent deliverable under the agreement. The Company determined the license had stand-alone value based on Janssen&#146;s ability to create value from the license without our R&amp;D support services due their extensive experience
	in vaccine development and production which would allow them to complete the phase 1b clinical trials.

	The assets are invested by the pension plan, to which many companies contribute, in a diversified portfolio that respects the requirements of the Swiss BVG.
	Under the Plan, both the Company and the employee share the costs equally. The structure of the plan and the legal provisions of the BVG mean that the employer is exposed to actuarial risks. The main risks are investment risk, interest risk,
	disability risk and the life expectancy of pensioners. Through our affiliation with the pension plan, the Company has minimized these risks, since they are shared between a much greater number of participants.
