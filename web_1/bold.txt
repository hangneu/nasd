	We are a biotechnology company
	focused on developing and commercializing gene therapy products for patients suffering from serious, life-threatening rare diseases caused by single gene defects. We believe that gene therapy has powerful potential to treat these diseases through
	delivery of a functional copy of the affected gene to cells, resulting in production of the normal protein. We have built a compelling portfolio of product candidates, including AT132 for the treatment of X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy, or XLMTM,
	AT342 for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar Syndrome, or Crigler-Najjar, AT982 for the treatment of Pompe disease and AT307 for the treatment of the CASQ2 subtype of Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, or CASQ2-CPVT. We plan to
	submit Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, or Clinical Trial Authorisations, or CTAs, for AT982 in the third quarter of 2016, for AT342 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and for AT132 in the first quarter of 2017, and expect to have
	preliminary data from all three programs in the second half of 2017. We maintain full global rights to all of our product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our
	vision is to become a fully integrated biotechnology company. In pursuit of this goal, we are executing on our core strategic initiatives, which include the development of proprietary in-house manufacturing capabilities and the expansion of our
	pipeline. We have assembled a world-class team with expertise in gene therapy, rare disease drug development and commercialization, and biologics manufacturing.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our mission is to dramatically and positively transform the lives of patients suffering from serious, life-threatening rare diseases with
	limited or no treatment options. For example, we are developing AT132 to treat XLMTM, a disease for which there are no approved therapies and from which approximately 50% of affected children die in the first 18&nbsp;months of life. We believe our
	product candidates have the potential to provide long-lasting benefits, changing the lives of patients with these devastating diseases. Given the available clinical and regulatory pathways, we believe that the rarity and severity of the diseases we
	target may provide advantages for drug development, including the potential for expedited development and regulatory review, and market exclusivity.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We focus on the treatment of rare diseases caused by single gene, or monogenic, defects in DNA that we believe can be effectively addressed
	using gene therapy. Conventional approaches such as protein therapeutics attempt to replace the deficient protein, but they do not correct the underlying genetic defect causing the disease. In addition, protein therapeutics often require frequent
	administration by injection or infusion and often result in sub-optimal safety and efficacy. We believe gene therapy is an ideal treatment modality for diseases caused by monogenic defects. Our portfolio of product candidates employs the use of
	adeno-associated virus, or AAV, a

	small, non-pathogenic virus that is genetically engineered to function as a delivery vehicle, or vector, and is administered to a patient to introduce a healthy copy of a mutated gene to the
	body. AAV gene therapy vectors are modified such that they will not cause an infection like a normal virus, but are capable of delivering therapeutic genes into patients&#146; cells. Vectors derived from AAV have a well-established safety profile in
	humans and have been shown to effectively deliver genes to the liver, eye, muscle and brain. Preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that AAV vectors are capable of providing durable efficacy with a favorable adverse event profile due at least in
	part to AAV&#146;s low immunogenic potential. AAV vectors can be described by the serotype, or strain, of the original virus isolate that was used to form the outer shell, or capsid, of the vector. We selected AAV8 and AAV9 as our in-licensed vector
	capsid serotypes, based on their biological properties, which we believe will translate into a positive clinical effect in our target indications. For example, we believe AAV8 is advantageous for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar given its ability to
	penetrate the liver, the primary organ implicated in this disease pathology.

	ventilator use or a feeding tube, are available. Infants with XLMTM are typically born with severe muscle weakness and the majority require chronic mechanical ventilation from birth. Of the patients that survive the infantile period, most are

	The disease is the result of mutations in the
	MTM1 gene that affect the production of myotubularin, an enzyme required for normal development and function of skeletal muscle. Mutations in the MTM1 gene result in production of too little or no functional protein. Importantly, we believe that
	even a modest increase of functional protein may have a significant therapeutic benefit for XLMTM patients. We believe AT132 may provide patients with significantly improved outcomes based on the ability of AAV8 to preferentially treat skeletal
	muscle, and has the potential to provide long-term clinical benefit to XLMTM patients through persistent expression of the functional protein following a single intravenous administration. We have two robust animal models of XLMTM, a genetically
	engineered murine model and a naturally occurring canine model. Both models present with disease symptoms similar to that of humans including severe muscle weakness, respiratory failure and early death.

	Preclinical study results in both canine and murine models of the disease demonstrated dramatic improvements in all outcomes, including
	histology, muscle strength, respiratory function and survival. In the naturally occurring Laborador Retriever model, symptom onset occurs at nine to ten weeks of age, and disease progression leads to death at approximately 18 weeks of age. Multiple
	studies in this model have demonstrated that a single administration of AT132 significantly improves all disease symptoms and survival rates. In two dogs treated in one of our earliest studies, these effects have lasted approximately three and a
	half years to date and the dogs continue to thrive. Our goal is to achieve these same benefits in XLMTM patients following a single intravenous administration of AT132.

	Crigler-Najjar is a rare, congenital autosomal recessive monogenic disease characterized by severely high levels
	of bilirubin in the blood and risk of irreversible neurological damage and death. Average life expectancy is reported as being 30 years of age with phototherapy. Crigler-Najjar is estimated to affect approximately one in 1,000,000 newborns. Infants
	with Crigler-Najjar develop severe jaundice shortly after birth resulting in rapid presentation and diagnosis. Crigler-Najjar is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the UGT1A1 (uridine-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1) enzyme
	resulting in an inability to convert unconjugated bilirubin to a water-soluble form that can be excreted from the body. Clinical diagnosis is confirmed via genetic testing of the UGT1A1 gene. The current standard of care for Crigler-Najjar is
	aggressive management of high bilirubin levels with persistent, daily phototherapy, usually for longer than 12 hours per day using intense fluorescent light focused on the bare skin, while the eyes are shielded. Phototherapy speeds bilirubin
	decomposition and excretion, lowering serum bilirubin levels. Phototherapy wanes in effectiveness beginning around age four due to thickening of the skin and a reduction in surface area to body mass ratio, and a liver transplant may be required for
	survival.

	We are developing AT342, an AAV8 vector containing a functional version of the UGT1A1 gene. Preclinical data in murine models

	significant, durable reduction in serum bilirubin, a reduction in or elimination of lengthy daily phototherapy, and elimination of the need for a liver transplant. We believe that serum bilirubin levels will be a clinically relevant endpoint and
	that determination of efficacy of AT342 will be straightforward due to the ease and reliability of measurement.

	progression varies with age of onset, ethnicity and geography. Pompe disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme alpha-glucosidase, or GAA, which results in a
	deficiency of GAA protein and leads to the accumulation of glycogen. GAA is responsible for degrading glycogen within the lysosome, and dysfunction or absence of functional GAA results in toxic accumulation of glycogen in cells. Tissues and cells
	most affected by the disease are predominantly skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and motoneurons. The only approved treatment for Pompe disease is enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, which is a chronic treatment delivered in bi-weekly intravenous
	infusions. Despite the availability of ERT, significant medical need still persists, which is primarily due to the inability of ERT to penetrate key tissues affected by the disease and immunogenicity of ERT treatment.

	We believe our approach with AT982, which uses an AAV serotype 9 capsid vector containing a functional copy of the GAA gene, can overcome the
	limitations of ERT and provide long-term improvement in patient symptoms. Further, we believe AT982 may provide patients with superior outcomes based on the ability of AAV9 to penetrate key cells and tissues affected by the disease, such as
	motoneurons, which are not effectively treated with ERT. Preclinical studies of AT982 have been conducted in a robust and well established genetically modified murine model of Pompe disease. In these studies, treatment resulted in improvement in
	several measures of efficacy, including enzyme activity, glycogen clearance and skeletal muscle, cardiac and respiratory function. We believe intracellular production of the therapeutic protein may improve efficacy, reduce immunogenicity and deliver
	a durable therapeutic effect with a single intravenous administration.

	CASQ2-CPVT is a rare monogenic disease
	that is characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias that may lead to sudden cardiac death. There are currently only limited treatment options with variable efficacy for patients suffering from CPVT, including beta-blockers and a sodium channel
	blocker. The autosomal recessive form of the disease is caused by mutations in the calsequestrin 2 gene, or CASQ2 gene, and is characterized by stress-induced heartbeat rhythm changes in an otherwise structurally normal heart. The CASQ2 protein
	plays a key role in the release of calcium within the cardiac muscle cell, which is necessary for normal cardiac contractile function to maintain normal heart rhythm. It is estimated that CPVT occurs in one in 10,000 people, with approximately 2% to
	5% due to mutations in the CASQ2 gene. This equates to an approximate prevalence of 6,000 affected people in North America, Europe and other addressable markets. The number of identified cases is likely to increase with the advent of more accessible
	genetic testing. It is estimated that 30% of people with CASQ2-CPVT will have had a cardiac event by the age of ten, and 79% will have had an event by the age of 40. Untreated, mortality is reported to be in the range of 30% to 50% by the age of 30.
	Despite available therapies to treat CPVT, which include beta-blockers and the sodium channel blocker flecainide, it is estimated that 30% to 40% of patients still experience significant cardiac events. Patients unresponsive to available therapies
	may be candidates for implantation of cardiac defibrillators, though their safety and effectiveness is considerably more limited in young patients. Due to the limitations of existing therapies, there remains a significant unmet medical need for
	patients with CPVT.

	Preclinical data in
	murine models of the disease demonstrated an ability to prevent ventricular tachycardia through restoration of CASQ2 protein expression. Initial preclinical proof-of-concept studies were conducted using an AT307 prototype product candidate in a
	genetically engineered murine model of CASQ2-CPVT. This mouse manifests stress-induced arrhythmias upon epinephrine administration, as well as cellular and molecular manifestations of the disease. In this model, a single administration of the AT307
	prototype resulted in a significant improvement in CASQ2 protein expression to a level approaching that of normal animals. We believe AT307 has the potential to provide long-term clinical benefit to CASQ2-CPVT patients through persistent expression
	of the protein following a single administration, resulting in a significant reduction in life-threatening arrhythmic events and other disease symptoms.

	We are very early in our development efforts. All of our product candidates are still in

	We are very early in our development efforts and all of our lead product candidates are still in preclinical
	development. We, or our collaborators, have only recently completed initial preclinical studies for our AT132, AT342, AT982 and AT307 programs. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the identification and

	Though viral vectors similar to ours have been evaluated by

	trials that our product candidates are safe and effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Earlier gene therapy clinical trials, which we
	believe serve as proof-of-concept for our product candidates, utilized adeno-associated viral vectors, or AAV vectors, similar to ours. For example, in October 2015, a gene therapy company publicly reported positive top-line results from a Phase 3
	trial of a product candidate intended to treat rare genetic blinding conditions. However, this study or others like it should not be relied upon as evidence that our planned clinical trials will succeed. Trial designs and results from previous
	trials are not necessarily predictive of our future clinical trial designs or results, and initial positive results we may observe may not be confirmed upon full analysis of the complete trial data. In addition, the positive results we have observed
	for our product candidates in preclinical animal models may not be predictive of our future clinical trials in humans. Our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development even if they

	From time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various
	scientific, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials and the submission
	of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. For example, throughout this prospectus, we state that we plan to submit INDs or CTAs for AT982 in the third quarter of 2016, for
	AT342 in the fourth quarter of 2016, for AT132 in the first quarter of 2017 and for AT307 in 2017, and expect to have preliminary data from our AT982, AT342 and AT132 programs in the second half of 2017. We also state that we intend to be capable of

	Our product candidates are based on a novel AAV gene therapy technology with which there is little clinical

	Our product candidates are based on gene therapy technology and our future success depends
	on the successful development of this novel therapeutic approach. We cannot assure you that any development problems we or other gene therapy companies experience in the future related to gene therapy technology will not cause significant delays or
	unanticipated costs in the development of our product candidates, or that such development problems can be solved. In addition, the clinical study requirements of the FDA, EMA and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to
	determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours
	can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied product candidates. Further, as we are developing novel treatments for diseases in which there is little clinical experience with new endpoints and
	methodologies, there is heightened risk that the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory bodies may not consider the clinical trial endpoints to provide clinically meaningful results, and the resulting clinical data and results may be more
	difficult to analyze. To date, no gene therapy product has been approved in the United States and only two gene therapy products have been approved in Europe, which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to
	obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in the United States, the European Union, or EU, or other jurisdictions. Further, approvals by EMA and the European Commission may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval.

	The FDA, NIH, other regulatory
	agencies at both the federal and state level in the United States, U.S. congressional committees, and the EMA and other foreign governments, have expressed interest in further regulating the biotechnology industry, including gene therapy and genetic
	testing. For example, the EMA advocates a risk-based approach to the development of a gene therapy product. Any such further regulation may delay or prevent commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. For example, in 1999, a patient
	died during a gene therapy clinical trial that utilized an adenovirus vector and it was later discovered that adenoviruses could generate an extreme immune system reaction that can be life-threatening. In January&nbsp;2000, the FDA halted that trial
	and began investigating 69 other gene therapy trials underway in the United States, 13 of which required remedial action. In 2003, the FDA suspended 27 additional gene therapy trials involving several hundred patients after learning that some
	patients treated in a clinical trial in France had subsequently developed leukemia.

	Regulatory requirements in the United States and
	abroad governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Prior to submitting an IND, our planned clinical trials will be subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities&#146;
	Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. Following an initial review, RAC members make a recommendation as to whether the protocol raises important scientific, safety, medical, ethical or social issues that warrant in-depth discussion at the
	RAC&#146;s quarterly meetings. Even though the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed under an IND, the RAC&#146;s recommendations are shared with the FDA and the RAC public review process, if undertaken, can delay the
	initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial design and details and has not objected to its initiation or has notified the sponsor that the study may begin. Conversely, the FDA can put an IND on a clinical hold even if the
	RAC has provided a favorable review or has recommended against an in-depth, public review. Moreover, under guidelines published by the NIH, patient enrollment in our planned clinical trials cannot begin until the investigator for such clinical trial
	has received a letter from the Office of Biotechnology Activities indicating that the RAC review process has been completed; and Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, approval as well as all other applicable regulatory authorizations have been
	obtained. In addition to the government regulators, the IBC and IRB of each institution at which we conduct our planned clinical trials, would need to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse
	developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other oversight bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates. Similarly, the EMA governs the development of gene
	therapies in the European Union and may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for gene therapy products and require that we comply with these new guidelines.

	Prior to

	marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have no experience in
	submitting and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each
	therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate&#146;s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by,

	approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional

	Further, the regulatory authorities may require concurrent approval or the CE mark, indicating conformity with applicability with
	European Community directives, of a companion diagnostic device. For the product candidates we currently are developing, we believe that diagnoses based on symptoms, in conjunction with existing genetic tests developed and administered by
	laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, are sufficient to diagnose patients and will be permitted by the FDA. For future product candidates, however, it may be necessary to use FDA-cleared or

	As discussed above, there have been several significant adverse side effects in gene therapy treatments in the past, including reported cases
	of leukemia and death seen in other trials using other vectors. While new AAV vectors have been developed to reduce these side effects, gene therapy is still a relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could
	develop. There also is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biologic activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material.

	Possible adverse side effects that could occur with treatment with gene therapy products include an immunologic reaction early after
	administration which, while not necessarily adverse to the patient&#146;s health, could substantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment. In previous clinical trials involving AAV vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced the
	development of a T-cell response, whereby after the vector is within the target cells, the cellular immune response system triggers the removal of transduced cells by activated T-cells. If our vectors demonstrate a similar effect we may decide or be
	required to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates.

	In addition to side effects caused by the product
	candidate, the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side effects. For AT307, potential procedure-related events are similar to those associated with standard coronary diagnostic procedures, and may include vascular
	injury (for example, damage to the femoral, radial or brachial arteries at the site of vascular access, or damage to the coronary arteries) or myocardial injury. If any such adverse events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated.
	If we are unable to demonstrate that any adverse events were caused by the administration process or related procedures, the FDA, the European Commission, the EMA or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or
	deny approval of, our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of
	enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to not initiate, delay, suspend or terminate any future clinical trial of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be
	harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates, and may harm our business, financial condition

	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including
	the United States and Europe, may designate drugs, or biologics in our case, intended to treat relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic as an orphan drug if it is intended
	to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for
	grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for qualified clinical research costs, and prescription drug user fee waivers. Similarly, in the European Union, the European Commission grants Orphan Drug Designation after receiving the
	opinion of the EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products on an Orphan Drug Designation application. In the European Union, Orphan Drug Designation is intended to promote the development of biologics that are intended for the diagnosis,
	prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized
	(or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). In the European Union, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers.

	Generally, if a biologic with an Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it

	circumstances. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity prior to us for products that constitute the same active moiety and treat the same indications as our product candidates, we may not be able to have competing products

	Additionally, even though we
	have obtained an Orphan Drug Designation for AT132, AT342, AT982 and AT307, and even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for these product candidates and other product candidates, that exclusivity may not effectively protect AT132, AT342, AT982 and
	AT307 from competition because drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can also subsequently approve a later application for the same drug for the same condition if
	the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer in a substantial portion of the target populations, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may
	not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Moreover, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later
	determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens
	the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.

	With the enactment
	of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for
	the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be
	approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a biologics license application, or BLA. On March&nbsp;6, 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA. However, the law is complex and is
	still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any
	such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.

	We believe that if
	any of our product candidates are approved as a biological product under a BLA it should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA will not consider any of our product candidates to be reference products
	for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Additionally, this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional
	BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological
	products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Finally, there has been public discussion of potentially decreasing the period of exclusivity from the current 12 years. If such
	a change were to be enacted, our product candidates, if approved, could have a shorter period of exclusivity than anticipated.

	Our product candidates require processing

	failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical-grade materials that meet the FDA, the EMA or other applicable

	There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly
	approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human
	Services, since CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a drug
	product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Further, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. It is difficult
	to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel products such as ours since there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS.
	For example, a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the United States and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain European countries.

	countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities
	can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product
	candidate to other available therapies. In general, the prices of products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company
	profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our product
	candidates may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.

	Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and internationally, to cap or reduce healthcare
	costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in
	connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of certain third-party payors, such as health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes. The downward
	pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the
	healthcare market.

	In addition to CMS and private payors, professional organizations such as the American Medical Association, or the
	AMA, can influence decisions about reimbursement for new products by determining standards for care. In addition, many private payors contract with commercial vendors who sell software that provide guidelines that attempt to limit utilization of,
	and therefore reimbursement for, certain products deemed to provide limited benefit to existing alternatives. Such organizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of our product candidates. Even if favorable coverage and
	reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

	Our in-licensed patents and patent applications are directed to the compositions of matter and methods of use related to
	various aspects of our product candidates as well as certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities. As of March 31, 2016, we had filed one U.S. provisional patent application directed to modified AAV vectors and methods of manufacturing the
	same. If granted, we expect this patent would expire in 2036. We have in-licensed patents and patent applications owned by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, or the University of Pennsylvania, relating to various AAV vectors. These
	patents and patent applications are licensed or sublicensed to REGENXBIO and sublicensed to us. Our first sublicense is exclusive in the field of treatment of XLMTM and Pompe disease in humans by

	second sublicense is exclusive in the field of treatment of CPVT in humans by

	gene therapy
	using AAV8. These sublicenses are subject to certain retained rights. We have also in-licensed a patent family owned by the Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri, or FSM, relating to gene therapy of recessive CPVT. We have also in-licensed certain patents,
	rights and know-how from the University of Florida Research Foundation for the treatment of Pompe, and certain intellectual property rights controlled by Genethon for the treatment of XLMTM. Additionally, since March 31, 2016, we have in-licensed a
	patent application from the University of Pennsylvania relating to AAV vectors containing codon-optimized UGT1A1 for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar. As described in &#147;Business&#151;Intellectual Property,&#148; the REGENXBIO patents will expire
	between 2022 and 2026, the FSM patents will expire by 2032 and the Genethon patent family will expire by 2034, and a patent obtained from the patent application filed by the University of Pennsylvania directed to UGT1A1 would be projected to expire
	in 2036 absent patent term adjustment or patent term extension. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of

	The degree of patent protection we require to successfully compete in the marketplace may be unavailable or severely
	limited in some cases and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. We cannot provide any assurances that any of our licensed patents have, or that any of our pending licensed patent applications
	that mature into issued patents will include, claims with a scope sufficient to protect our current and future product candidates or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. The FSM and Genethon patent families were filed only in the United
	States, and therefore these patent families will not provide patent protection outside the United States. While other patent families include foreign counterparts, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the
	laws of the United States. In addition, none of the patent applications licensed from the University of Florida Research Foundation relating to gene therapy for Pompe disease have matured into issued patents in the United States. Furthermore,
	patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally twenty years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited.
	Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. If any of our AT132, AT342,
	AT982 or AT307 product candidates are approved by the FDA as a biological product under a BLA in the United States, we believe the product would qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity. For example, if our AT132 product was approved by the FDA
	as a biological product under a BLA in 2020, we believe it would qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity, which would expire in 2032, or two years before the Genethon patent family will expire in the United States absent patent term adjustment
	or patent term extension. Similarly, if our AT307 product was approved by the FDA as a biological product under a BLA in 2020, we believe it would qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity, which would expire in 2032, the same year the FSM patent
	family will expire in the United States absent patent term adjustment or patent term extension. Moreover, our exclusive license is subject to retained rights, which may adversely impact our competitive position. As a result, our licensed patent
	portfolio may not provide us with adequate and continuing patent protection sufficient to exclude others from commercializing products similar to our product candidates, including biosimilar versions of such products. In addition, the patent
	portfolio licensed to us is, or may be,

	behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and in other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether the
	inventors of our licensed patents and applications were the first to make the inventions claimed in those patents or pending patent applications, or that they were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Further, we cannot assure
	you that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our licensed patents and patent applications has been found. If such prior art exists, it can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. As a
	result, the issuance, scope, validity and commercial value of our patent rights cannot be predicted with any certainty.

	on our research and development efforts, or that any such patents or other intellectual property we generate will provide any competitive advantage. Patent prosecution is a lengthy process and the scope of the claims initially submitted for
	examination may be significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if at all. Moreover, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to control the maintenance of the patents, covering

	Even if we acquire patent protection that we expect should enable us to maintain competitive advantage, third parties, including competitors,

	to outsource and rely on third parties for many aspects of the clinical development, sales and marketing of our products covered under our license agreements. Delay or failure by any such third parties could adversely affect the continuation of our
	license agreements with third-party licensors. For example, our Exclusive License Agreement with Know-How with the University of Florida Research Foundation provides that the University of Florida Research Foundation has the right to terminate the
	agreement if we do not meet certain deadlines, such as submitting an IND or foreign equivalent in any country by October 31, 2016 or dosing the first patient in clinical trials in any country by March 31, 2017.

	we do not know which processes we will use for commercial manufacture of our future products, or which technologies owned or controlled by third parties may prove important or essential to those processes. Given the vast number of patents in our
	field of technology, we cannot be certain or guarantee that we do not infringe existing patents or that we will not infringe patents that may be granted in the future. Many companies have filed, and continue to file, patent applications related to
	gene therapy and orphan diseases. Some of these patent applications have already been allowed or issued and others may issue in the future. Since this area is competitive and of strong interest to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, there
	will likely be additional patent applications filed and additional patents granted in the future, as well as additional research and development programs expected in the future. Furthermore, because patent applications can take many years to issue,
	may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing and can be revised before issuance, there may be applications now pending which may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by the manufacture, use, sale or importation of our
	product candidates or future products. If a patent holder believes the manufacture, use, sale or importation of one of our product candidates or future products infringes its patent, the patent holder may

	third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our product candidates and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of
	patent claims. We may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance

	In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely upon unpatented trade

	Many of the intellectual property rights we have licensed are generated through the use of U.S. government funding and are therefore subject
	to certain federal regulations. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future product candidates pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, or Bayh-Dole Act. These U.S. government
	rights in certain inventions developed under a government-funded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to
	require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i)&nbsp;adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii)&nbsp;government action
	is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii)&nbsp;government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as &#147;march-in rights&#148;). The U.S. government also has the right
	to take title to these inventions if we, or the applicable licensor, fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated
	under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us or the applicable licensor to expend substantial resources. In addition, the U.S. government requires that any products
	embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that
	reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not
	commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property. To the extent any of our current or future intellectual property
	is generated through the use of U.S. government funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply.

	infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, in addition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. In any patent infringement proceeding,
	there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the

	and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine

	As is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is

	of patents. In addition, the Leahy-Smith Act has transformed the U.S. patent system into a &#147;first to file&#148; system. The first-to-file provisions, however, only became effective in March&nbsp;2013. Accordingly, it is not yet clear what, if

	The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain
	circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, in Association for Molecular Pathology&nbsp;v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that a &#147;naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of
	nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,&#148; and invalidated Myriad Genetics&#146;s patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Certain claims of our licensed patents relate to isolated AAV vectors, capsid proteins, or nucleic
	acids. To the extent that such claims are deemed to be directed to natural products, or to lack an inventive concept above and beyond an isolated natural product, a court may decide the claims are invalid under Myriad. Additionally, there have been
	recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if adopted, could impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary technology or our ability to enforce our proprietary
	technology. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our

	Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial

	over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. The material weakness that was

	on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal
	control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the
	adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for
	internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial
	reporting is effective as required by Section&nbsp;404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.

	Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more

	These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in &#147;Risk

	impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks,
	uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a biotechnology company
	focused on developing and commercializing gene therapy products for patients suffering from serious, life-threatening rare diseases caused by single gene defects. We believe that gene therapy has powerful potential to treat these diseases through
	delivery of a functional copy of the affected gene to cells, resulting in production of the normal protein. Our vision is to become a fully integrated biotechnology company. In pursuit of this goal, we are executing on our core strategic
	initiatives, which include the development of proprietary in-house manufacturing capabilities and the expansion of our pipeline. We have assembled a world-class team with expertise in gene therapy, rare disease drug development and
	commercialization, and biologics manufacturing.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have built a compelling portfolio of product candidates, including AT132 for the
	treatment of
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	X-Linked
</FONT>
	Myotubular Myopathy, or XLMTM, AT342 for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar Syndrome, or Crigler-Najjar, AT982 for the treatment of Pompe disease and AT307 for the treatment of the CASQ2
	subtype of Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, or CASQ2-CPVT. We plan to submit Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, or Clinical Trial Authorisations, or CTAs, for AT982 in the third quarter of 2016, for AT342 in the
	fourth quarter of 2016 and for AT132 in the first quarter of 2017, and expect to have preliminary data from all three programs in the second half of 2017. Given the available clinical and regulatory pathways, we believe that the rarity and severity
	of the diseases we target may provide advantages for drug development, including the potential for expedited development and regulatory review, and market exclusivity. We maintain full global rights to all of our product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have built our portfolio of product candidates in part by engaging in strategic transactions with third parties. In July 2013, we entered
	into a license agreement with REGENXBIO Inc., or REGENXBIO, pursuant to which we obtained intellectual property rights related to AT132 and AT982. In January 2014, we entered into a collaborative development agreement with Genethon, pursuant to
	which we acquired intellectual property rights related to AT132 in exchange for granting Genethon the exclusive right to manufacture materials for preclinical and early clinical development, subject to Genethon&#146;s ability to supply required
	quantities in accordance with applicable timelines, and the funding for certain research and development activities related to AT132. In July 2015, we entered into a license with the University of Florida Research Foundation, or UFRF, pursuant to
	which we obtained intellectual property rights related to AT982. In August 2015, in connection with our acquisition of Cardiogen Sciences, Inc., or Cardiogen, we acquired a license agreement with Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri, or FSM, pursuant to
	which we obtained a license to FSM&#146;s intellectual property rights related to AT307 and certain other products that we may develop related to the treatment of several additional inherited arrhythmias. In November 2015, we entered into two
	additional license agreements with REGENXBIO, pursuant to which we obtained intellectual property rights related to AT307 and AT342. In May 2016, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with the The Trustees of the University of
	Pennsylvania, or the University of Pennsylvania, pursuant to which we obtained a license to develop and commercialize a gene therapy product for Crigler-Najjar.

	Upon execution of the license and collaboration agreement with the University of Pennsylvania, we
	met the conditions of a contractual milestone under our Crigler-Najjar license agreement with REGENXBIO, and made the required payment of $0.4 million to REGENXBIO. We also paid the University of Pennsylvania an upfront fee of $0.5 million, as well
	as $3.0 million for certain preclinical development activities. We may be required to make additional milestone payments and pay royalties and other amounts to third parties pursuant to our license and collaboration agreements as we further develop

	Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to: identifying,
	acquiring, and developing our product candidate portfolio; organizing and staffing our company; raising capital; developing our manufacturing capabilities; and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have never
	generated revenue and have incurred significant net losses since inception. We do not expect to receive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates or enter
	into collaborative agreements with third parties. Our net losses were $10.8 million and $26.5 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and $4.1 million and $10.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and

	We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable
	future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, including investments in manufacturing, as our programs advance into later stages of development and as we begin to conduct clinical
	trials. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the
	duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.

	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities costs, including rent and maintenance of facilities,
	depreciation and amortization expense and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resources, audit and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. In
	addition, we incurred acquisition costs, which were primarily legal and accounting fees, in connection with our acquisition of Cardiogen in 2015. There was no comparable expense in 2014 or the three months ended March 31, 2016. We expect our general
	and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future due to anticipated increases in headcount to advance our product candidates and as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules
	and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, The NASDAQ Global Market, additional insurance expense, investor relations activities and other administration and professional services.

	amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based
	on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
	apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as
	these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management&#146;s judgments and estimates.

	As of December 31, 2015, our total gross deferred tax assets were $19.4 million. Due to our lack
	of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax
	net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial
	annual limitation due to ownership changes that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions. These ownership change
	limitations may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an &#147;ownership change&#148; as defined by
	Section&nbsp;382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points (by value) of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders.
	Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions, which separately or combined with the purchasing stockholders&#146; subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in such ownership
	changes, or could result in ownership changes in the future.

	We have not completed an analysis to assess whether an ownership change has
	occurred. If we have experienced an ownership change as defined in the Code at any time since our formation, utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 of the Code. Any
	limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any limitation known, no amounts are being considered as an uncertain tax position or disclosed as
	an unrecognized tax benefit. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, future changes in our unrecognized tax benefits will not impact our effective tax rate. Any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such
	limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets, with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance.

	addition, there was a $2.6 million increase in expenses related to our AT132 and AT982 programs, as we conducted additional preclinical studies, increased manufacturing of study materials and incurred consulting and initiation costs in preparation
	for future clinical trials. In addition, we launched the AT342 and AT307 programs in 2015, incurring total costs of $2.4 million in 2015, with no comparable costs in 2014. There was also an increase of $1.2 million for lab supplies and $0.6 million
	for other expenses related to expanded research and development activities in support of preclinical activities and manufacturing process development. In addition, the increase in the fair value of the acquisition contingent consideration payable

	Since our inception in 2012 through March 31, 2016, our operations have been financed solely by net proceeds of $135.8&nbsp;million from the
	sale of shares of our convertible preferred stock. As of March 31, 2016, we had $80.3&nbsp;million in cash, cash equivalents and investments and an accumulated deficit of $51.2&nbsp;million.

	Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist of research and development expenditures and general and administrative
	expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash and capital expenditure
	requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We will continue to require additional
	financing to advance our current product candidates through clinical development, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to seek funds through equity
	or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when
	needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies.

	Further,
	our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of

	reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our clinical trials, research and development programs or commercialization efforts. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a
	combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and collaborations or licensing arrangements. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will
	be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders&#146; rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or
	restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If additional funding is required, there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us on
	acceptable terms on a timely basis, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital, we will need to curtail planned activities to reduce costs. Doing so will likely have an unfavorable effect on our ability to execute our business plans.

	Beginning in January 2015, we entered into a series of amendments to our prior Janssen facility lease to increase the office and lab space,
	which resulted in a quarterly lease expense of approximately $0.1 million and an increase in the aggregate security deposit to approximately $0.1&nbsp;million. The Janssen facility lease was terminated in June 2016. In July 2015, we entered into a

	During the audit of our financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, a material weakness was identified in our
	internal control over financial reporting. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
	is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. The material weakness that was identified related to a lack of sufficient
	accounting resources and personnel that limits our ability to adequately segregate duties, establish defined accounting policies and procedures and perform timely reviews of account reconciliations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have implemented and are continuing to implement measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to address the
	underlying causes of this material weakness, including the hiring of our Chief Financial Officer and other accounting personnel and establishing new accounting and financial reporting procedures, policies and processes to have in place an
	appropriate level of internal control over financial reporting. We, and our independent registered public accounting firm, were not required to perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 in
	accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses. Material weaknesses may still exist when we report on
	the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by reporting requirements under Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after the completion of this offering.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a biotechnology company
	focused on developing and commercializing gene therapy products for patients suffering from serious, life-threatening rare diseases caused by single gene defects. We believe that gene therapy has powerful potential to treat these diseases through
	delivery of a functional copy of the affected gene to cells, resulting in production of the normal protein. We have built a compelling portfolio of product candidates, including AT132 for the treatment of X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy, or XLMTM,
	AT342 for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar Syndrome, or Crigler-Najjar, AT982 for the treatment of Pompe disease and AT307 for the treatment of the CASQ2 subtype of Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, or CASQ2-CPVT. We plan to
	submit Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, or Clinical Trial Authorisations, or CTAs, for AT982 in the third quarter of 2016, for AT342 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and for AT132 in the first quarter of 2017, and expect to have
	preliminary data from all three programs in the second half of 2017. We maintain full global rights to all of our product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our
	vision is to become a fully integrated biotechnology company. In pursuit of this goal, we are executing on our core strategic initiatives, which include the development of proprietary in-house manufacturing capabilities and the expansion of our
	pipeline. We have assembled a world-class team with expertise in gene therapy, rare disease drug development and commercialization, and biologics manufacturing.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our mission is to dramatically and positively transform the lives of patients suffering from serious, life-threatening rare diseases with
	limited or no treatment options. For example, we are developing AT132 to treat XLMTM, a disease for which there are no approved therapies and from which approximately 50% of affected children die in the first 18 months of life. We believe our
	product candidates have the potential to provide long-lasting benefits, changing the lives of patients with these devastating diseases. Given the available clinical and regulatory pathways, we believe that the rarity and severity of the diseases we
	target may provide advantages for drug development, including the potential for expedited development and regulatory review, and market exclusivity.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We focus on the treatment of rare diseases caused by single gene, or monogenic, defects in DNA that we believe can be effectively addressed
	using gene therapy. Conventional approaches such as protein therapeutics attempt to replace the deficient protein, but they do not correct the underlying genetic defect causing the disease. In addition, protein therapeutics often require frequent
	administration by injection or infusion and often result in sub-optimal safety and efficacy. We believe gene therapy is an ideal treatment modality for diseases caused by monogenic defects. Our portfolio of product candidates employs the use of
	adeno-associated virus, or AAV, a small, non-pathogenic virus that is genetically engineered to function as a delivery vehicle, or vector, and is administered to a patient to introduce a healthy copy of a mutated gene to the body. AAV gene therapy
	vectors are modified such that they will not cause an infection like a normal virus, but are capable of delivering therapeutic genes into patients&#146; cells. Vectors derived from AAV have a well-established safety profile in humans and have been
	shown to effectively deliver genes to the liver, eye, muscle and brain. Preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that AAV vectors are capable of providing durable efficacy with a favorable adverse event profile due at least in part to AAV&#146;s
	low immunogenic potential. AAV vectors can be described by the serotype, or strain, of the original virus isolate that was used to form the outer shell, or capsid, of the vector. We selected AAV8 and AAV9 as our in-licensed vector capsid serotypes,
	based on their biological properties, which we believe will translate into positive clinical effect in our target indications. For example, we believe AAV8 is advantageous for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar given its ability to penetrate the liver,
	the primary organ implicated in this disease pathology.

	XLMTM is characterized by extreme muscle weakness, respiratory failure and
	early death with an estimated 50% mortality rate in the first 18&nbsp;months of life. The disease is the result of mutations in the MTM1 gene that affect the production of myotubularin, an enzyme required for normal development and function of
	skeletal muscle. The incidence of XLMTM is estimated to be one in 50,000 male births. Currently, only supportive treatment options, such as ventilator use or a feeding tube, are available. We are developing AT132, an AAV8 vector containing a
	functional copy of the MTM1 gene, for the treatment of XLMTM. We believe AT132 may provide patients with significantly improved outcomes based on the ability of AAV8 to preferentially treat skeletal muscle. Preclinical study results in both canine
	and murine models of the disease demonstrated dramatic improvements in all outcomes, including histology, muscle strength, respiratory function and survival. Our goal is to achieve these same benefits in XLMTM patients following a single intravenous
	administration of AT132.

	resulting in rapid presentation and diagnosis. Crigler-Najjar is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the UGT1A1 (uridine-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1) enzyme resulting
	in an inability to convert unconjugated bilirubin to a water-soluble form that can be excreted from the body. Clinical diagnosis is confirmed via genetic testing of the UGT1A1 gene. The current standard of care for Crigler-Najjar is aggressive
	management of high bilirubin levels with persistent, daily phototherapy, usually for longer than 12 hours per day using intense fluorescent light focused on the bare skin, while the eyes are shielded. Phototherapy speeds bilirubin decomposition and
	excretion, lowering serum bilirubin levels. Phototherapy wanes in effectiveness beginning around age four due to thickening of the skin and a reduction in surface area to body mass ratio, and a liver transplant may be required for survival.

	We are developing AT342, an AAV8 vector containing a functional version of the UGT1A1 gene. Preclinical data in murine models of the disease
	demonstrate AAV8-UGT1A1 significantly reduces bilirubin levels, even at UGT1A1 liver expression levels of just five to eight percent of normal. We are advancing AT342 with the goal of administering a single dose that results in a significant,
	durable reduction in serum bilirubin, a reduction in or elimination of lengthy daily phototherapy, and elimination of the need for a liver transplant. We believe that serum bilirubin levels will be a clinically relevant endpoint and that
	determination of efficacy of&nbsp;AT342 will be straightforward due to the ease and reliability of measurement.

	AT982.
</I>
</B>
	Pompe disease is a serious, progressive genetic disease characterized by severe muscle weakness, respiratory failure leading to ventilator dependence and, in infants, increased cardiac mass and heart failure. In untreated infants, the disease is
	often fatal due to cardio-respiratory failure within the first year of life. Pompe disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme alpha-glucosidase, or GAA, which results in a deficiency of GAA protein and leads to the
	accumulation of glycogen. The incidence of Pompe disease is approximately one in 40,000 births. The only approved treatment for Pompe disease is enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, which is a chronic treatment delivered in bi-weekly intravenous
	infusions. Despite the availability of ERT, significant medical need still persists, which is primarily due to the inability of ERT to penetrate key tissues affected by the disease and immunogenicity of ERT treatment. We believe our approach with
	AT982, which uses an AAV serotype 9 capsid vector containing a functional copy of the GAA gene, can overcome the limitations of ERT and provide long-term improvement in patient symptoms. Further, we believe AT982 may provide patients with superior
	outcomes based on the ability of AAV9 to penetrate key cells and tissues affected by the disease, such as motoneurons, which are not effectively treated with ERT. Preclinical data in a murine model achieved statistically significant improvements in
	weight gain, ventilation parameters, glycogen deposition and cardiac left ventricle mass. We believe intracellular production of the therapeutic protein may improve efficacy, reduce immunogenicity and deliver a durable therapeutic effect with a
	single intravenous administration.

	CASQ2-CPVT is a rare monogenic disease that is characterized by life-threatening
	arrhythmias that may lead to sudden cardiac death. There are currently only limited treatment options with variable efficacy for patients suffering from CPVT, including beta-blockers and a sodium channel blocker. The autosomal recessive form of the
	disease is caused by mutations in the calsequestrin 2 gene, or CASQ2 gene, and is characterized by stress-induced heartbeat rhythm changes in an otherwise structurally normal heart. It is estimated that CPVT occurs in one in 10,000 people, with
	approximately 2% to 5% due to mutations in the CASQ2 gene. This equates to an approximate prevalence of 6,000 affected people in North America, Europe and other addressable markets. Despite treatment with anti-arrhythmia therapies, sympathectomy and
	implantable cardiac defibrillators, a significant portion of the patients remain symptomatic. We are developing AT307, an AAV9 vector containing a functional version of the CASQ2 gene. We believe AT307 may provide patients with improved outcomes
	based on the ability of AAV9 to preferentially treat cardiac muscle. Preclinical data in murine models of the disease demonstrated an ability to prevent ventricular tachycardia through restoration of CASQ2 protein expression. We are advancing AT307
	with the goal of providing a single administration of AT307 that results in a significant reduction in life-threatening arrhythmic events and a major improvement in quality of life.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Genes are
	composed of sequences of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, which code for proteins that perform a broad range of physiologic functions within all living organisms. DNA is a large, highly charged molecule that is difficult to transport across a cell
	membrane and deliver to the nucleus, where it can be transcribed and translated into protein.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Gene therapy is a therapeutic approach to
	treating genetic diseases caused by mutations in DNA. For gene therapy to work, an isolated gene sequence or segment of DNA needs to be delivered efficiently to the desired target tissues and cell types. The treatment involves the administration of
	a functional gene to produce normal protein within a patient&#146;s cells, offering the potential for durable therapeutic benefit. To achieve these goals, scientists have designed and developed a variety of viral vectors to facilitate gene delivery
	in cells.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The AAV
	gene therapy vectors we utilize are capable of transducing a wide range of tissues with generally little or no toxicity and only mild immune response. Functionally, AAV packages a single-stranded linear DNA genome that can be engineered to contain a
	therapeutic gene in place of all the virus genes. AAV vectors have a well-established safety profile and do not naturally propagate by themselves in the absence of another viral infection, reducing the likelihood of inappropriate viral spread
	following administration. As a result, AAV vectors are emerging as the preferred delivery vehicle for gene therapy.

	Our vector design
	strategy includes careful selection of the vector capsid (the outer protein shell) and sophisticated engineering of the vector genome (the therapeutic DNA expression cassette) to target the correct tissues and improve the potential to provide

	XLMTM is a rare,
	severe, congenital muscle disease with an estimated incidence of one in 50,000 male births. The disease is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene, which encodes a protein called myotubularin. Myotubularin is an enzyme involved in the development,
	maturation, maintenance and function of skeletal muscle cells. Mutations in the MTM1 gene result in production of too little or no functional protein. Importantly, we believe that even a modest increase of functional protein may have a significant
	therapeutic benefit for XLMTM patients.

	AT132 is an AAV8

	tissues. AT132 was designed with these elements because AAV8 is known to effectively penetrate skeletal muscle and the desmin promoter is primarily active in muscle. We believe AT132 has the potential to provide long-term clinical benefit to XLMTM
	patients through persistent expression of the functional protein following a single intravenous administration.

	We have two robust animal models of XLMTM, a murine model consisting of mice engineered to knock out the functional MTM1 gene, or

	including severe muscle weakness, respiratory failure and early death. We believe that in this indication the canine model, as with many large animal models, is particularly valuable given similarities to humans with XLMTM in size, weight and

	Crigler-Najjar is a rare, congenital autosomal recessive monogenic disease characterized by severely high levels of bilirubin in the blood and
	risk of irreversible neurological damage and death. Crigler-Najjar is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the UGT1A1 (uridine-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1) enzyme resulting in an inability to convert unconjugated
	bilirubin to a water-soluble form that can be excreted from the body. Unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood brain barrier, and the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the central nervous system can lead to irreversible neurological damage
	and death.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Infants with Crigler-Najjar develop severe jaundice shortly after birth resulting in rapid presentation and diagnosis.
	Clinical diagnosis can be confirmed via genetic testing of the UGT1A1 gene. The current standard of care for Crigler-Najjar is aggressive management of high bilirubin levels with persistent, daily phototherapy, usually for longer than 12 hours per
	day, for the rest of a patient&#146;s life. Exchange transfusion or plasmapheresis are sometimes required in order to lower bilirubin levels rapidly. Phototherapy becomes less effective as a child ages, beginning around the age of four years.
	Average life expectancy is reported as being 30 years of age with phototherapy, and there is an ongoing lifelong risk of a catastrophic cerebral event. Crigler-Najjar is estimated to affect approximately one in 1,000,000 newborns.

	There are currently no products approved specifically for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar. The current standard of care for Crigler-Najjar is
	aggressive management of high bilirubin levels, with persistent, daily phototherapy, usually for longer than 12 hours per day using intense fluorescent light focused on the bare skin, while the eyes are shielded. The impact on quality of life is
	substantial. Phototherapy speeds bilirubin decomposition and excretion, lowering serum bilirubin levels. However, the effectiveness of phototherapy typically wanes beginning around four years of age due to thickening of the skin and a reduction in
	the surface area to body mass ratio. As children get older, compliance with phototherapy becomes challenging. As Crigler-Najjar infants and children begin to experience progression of neurological symptoms and increasing risk of a catastrophic
	cerebral event, a liver transplant is often required for survival. However, limited donor organ availability, the risks associated with the transplant procedure itself and potential for organ rejection limit the utility of a transplant as a
	widespread treatment modality for Crigler-Najjar.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	AT342 consists of an AAV8 vector capsid designed to deliver a functional UGT1A1 gene and increase UGT1A1 protein expression in the liver and
	other tissues. Importantly, AAV8 has high affinity for liver cells allowing for the efficient introduction of therapeutic genes into liver cells. We believe that, if approved and determined by the FDA to be safe and effective, AT342 has the
	potential to provide long-term clinical benefit to Crigler-Najjar patients through persistent expression of the protein following a single administration, resulting in significant reduction in bilirubin levels, reduction or elimination of the need
	for lengthy daily phototherapy treatment and elimination of the need for a liver transplant.

	Pompe disease
	is a rare, severe, progressive, congenital neuromuscular disease. The overall incidence is estimated to be approximately one in 40,000 people although frequency and disease progression varies with age of onset, ethnicity and geography. The disease
	is characterized by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, or GAA. GAA is responsible for degrading glycogen within the lysosome, and dysfunction or absence of functional GAA results in toxic accumulation of glycogen
	in cells. Tissues and cells most affected by the disease are predominantly skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and motoneurons.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The severity
	of Pompe disease symptoms and rate of progression is highly variable and correlated with age of symptom onset and the degree of enzyme deficiency. Infantile or early onset disease, the most severe form of Pompe disease, accounts for approximately
	one quarter of all affected patients. Those with early-onset disease are usually diagnosed in the first few months of life due to the severe presentation associated with total or near-total absence of GAA activity, and confirmatory diagnosis is made
	through genetic testing. These infants usually present with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, muscular hypotonia, progressive weakness, respiratory distress, severe enlargement of the tongue and thickening of the heart muscle. If left
	untreated, these children usually die in the first year of life. Those with late-onset disease typically have enzyme levels at 1% to 40% of normal and usually have symptoms such as reduced mobility and respiratory problems. Late-onset patients
	experience progressive difficulty walking and respiratory decline, and although life expectancy can vary, it is a life-limiting disease and death generally occurs due to complications from respiratory failure. Newborn-screening programs can
	successfully identify Pompe disease in the newborn period, but such programs have not yet been widely implemented worldwide.

	At three months following administration, both the AT982 and ERT-treated groups showed

	respiratory cycle as compared with both ERT and control, which resulted in outcomes comparable to those in normal mice. These data are shown in the figure below. The enhanced respiratory function on these parameters compared to ERT may result from
	increased GAA activity in motoneurons, specifically the phrenic nerve that innervates the diaphragm. For three of the six measures studied, no significant differences were detected between all three groups at this age. Separate studies in the murine

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CASQ2-CPVT is a
	life-threatening, autosomal recessive, inherited cardiac disease caused by mutations in the CASQ2 gene that encodes the protein called calsequestrin 2. The CASQ2 protein plays a key role in the release of calcium within the cardiac muscle cell,
	which is necessary for normal cardiac contractile function to maintain normal heart rhythm. It is estimated that CPVT occurs in one in 10,000 people, with approximately 2% to 5% due to mutations in the CASQ2 gene. This equates to an estimated
	prevalence of 6,000 affected people in North America, Europe and other addressable markets. The number of identified cases is likely to increase with the advent of more accessible genetic testing.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CPVT is characterized by the sudden occurrence of severe ventricular arrhythmia that can cause dizziness and fainting, and can progress
	rapidly to cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. These arrhythmias are triggered during exercise or in response to a sudden stressful occurrence. It is estimated that 30% of people with CASQ2-CPVT will have had a cardiac event by the age of ten,
	and 79% will have had an event by the age of 40. Untreated, mortality is reported to be in the range of 30% to 50% by the age of 30. In addition, a high proportion of sudden infant death is also thought to be due to severe arrhythmia-related events
	such as CPVT. Due to the association between exercise, stress and the onset of symptoms, there is a significant impact on the activities of daily living of patients, their families and their caregivers, as any stressful event or activity may trigger
	an episode, creating considerable anxiety for the patients and their family members. Despite major electrophysiological abnormality, patients with CPVT have a structurally normal heart and a normal baseline electrocardiogram. However, during a
	cardiac stress test, such as an exercise test on a treadmill, patients with CVPT display a distinct &#147;polymorphic&#148; electrocardiogram that makes clinical diagnosis straightforward.

	Despite available therapies to treat CPVT, which include beta-blockers and the sodium channel blocker flecainide, it is estimated that 30% to
	40% of patients still experience significant cardiac events. Patients unresponsive to available therapies may be candidates for implantation of cardiac defibrillators, though their safety and effectiveness is considerably more limited in young
	patients. Due to the limitations of existing therapies, there remains a significant unmet medical need for patients with CPVT.

	resulted in a significant improvement in CASQ2 protein expression to a level approaching that of normal animals. Cardiomyocytes isolated from animals with a CASQ2 mutation show abnormal electrophysiology, as demonstrated by pre-arrhythmic events

	Our manufacturing strategy focuses on utilizing mammalian cells as the
	substrate for AAV-based product candidates. Mammalian cells are the natural host for AAV, and so provide a cellular environment most closely mimicking that in which the virus normally replicates. We believe that matching the production host cell to
	the vector in this way best preserves the quality of the replication complexes responsible for synthesizing viral vector genomes and creating, assembling and filling viral vector capsids with those genomes. Our early phase product candidates are
	manufactured using transient transfection, in which genetic components for vector production are supplied to cells during each manufacturing run. We are evaluating a future transition to a stable cell line system, in which at least some genetic
	components are permanently integrated into the host cell genome before manufacturing occurs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our current production process utilizes
	HEK293 cells, which are the most commonly used host cell for AAV vector production. These cells are familiar to regulatory authorities and commercial cell culture media manufacturers, and take up foreign DNA robustly to produce high transient vector
	titers. Our early clinical stage production platform utilizes serum-free suspension cell culture of HEK293 cells and transient transfection of plasmids to produce clinical grade AAV vectors in a scalable process. We believe this approach maximizes
	speed of development, product quality and regulatory compliance. Further, our analytical team utilizes the latest technologies for characterization of biological molecules to enable the creation of strict standards of quality and potency that we
	believe will differentiate our products from others in the field.

	As our products progress through clinical development, we plan to transition their production to newer mammalian cell processes that maximize
	vector product yield while maintaining the high quality derived from the current processes. This may include transitioning to a stable cell producer system, which our team is currently evaluating in our research facilities. As large scale gene

	In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the

	and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of
	the FDC Act which governs the approval of New Drug Applications, or NDAs. Biological products, such as our gene therapy products, are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License
	Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S.
	requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension

	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the
	characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to
	the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as tests of reproductive toxicity and
	carcinogenicity in animals, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the
	IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical
	trials must be conducted: (i)&nbsp;in compliance with federal regulations; (ii)&nbsp;in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical
	trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii)&nbsp;under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving

	After
	completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing and distribution of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all
	preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#146;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is
	additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,374,000 for Fiscal Year 2016. Under an approved BLA, the applicant is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per
	product and $585,000 per establishment for Fiscal Year 2016. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agency&#146;s
	determination that it is adequately organized and sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the
	review of BLAs. Most applications are classified as Standard Review products that are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA accepts the BLA for filing; applications classified as Priority Review are reviewed within six months of the date
	the FDA accepts the BLA for filing. A BLA can be classified for Priority Review when the FDA determines the biologic product has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in
	safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by the FDA for three or more additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended
	to clarify information already provided in the BLA submission.

	The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or
	biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to be reviewed by an advisory committee&#151;typically a panel that includes clinicians, statisticians and other experts&#151;for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as
	to whether the BLA should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure
	compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that
	provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the claimed indication.

	of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have
	been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. For instance, FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies in clinical trials for potential gene
	therapy-related delayed adverse events for a minimum 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. FDA does not require the long-term tracking

	In addition, if a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions
	receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving
	Recombinant DNA Molecules, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA. In addition, many companies and other institutions not subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH convenes the RAC, a federal advisory committee, to discuss
	selected protocols and informed consent documents that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA notifies the FDA of the RAC&#146;s decision regarding the

	The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to
	be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage
	form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial

	Once
	a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer
	advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the
	approved labeling.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA.
	The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the
	product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their
	establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects a biologic product&#146;s manufacturing facilities to assess
	compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request
	product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

	In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the
	FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ,
	and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the
	federal false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended.

	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying,
	soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service
	reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between
	pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and/or formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions
	and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
	Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on
	a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA,
	to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items
	or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).

	presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal
	government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes &#147;any request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other
	healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false

	also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product

	disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval.
	In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate
	reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a
	third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to
	specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and
	reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and
	cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not
	imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement
	may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

	Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products
	through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only
	be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to
	currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high
	barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and
	third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and
	third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may
	be implemented in the future.

	Our

	Our board of directors, or a committee thereof appointed by our board of directors, administers the 2012 Plan and the awards granted under it. The plan administrator has the authority to modify outstanding awards under the 2012 Plan. The 2012 Plan
	provides for the grant of both incentive stock options, which qualify for favorable tax treatment to their recipients under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, and nonstatutory stock options, as well as for the issuance of shares of restricted stock
	awards, or RSAs, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and stock appreciation rights, or SARs. We may grant incentive stock options only to our employees and employees of our

	option must be at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, unless expressly determined in writing by the plan administrator. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted to 10% stockholders must be at
	least equal to 110% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum permitted term of options granted under the 2012 Plan is ten&nbsp;years, except that the maximum permitted term of incentive stock options granted to
	10% stockholders is five years. In the event of an acquisition (as defined in the 2012 Plan), the 2012 Plan provides that, unless the applicable option agreement provides otherwise or our board of directors or compensation committee takes certain
	actions, such as accelerating the vesting of the awards or providing for the assumption, conversion or replacement of the option by an acquirer, awards held by current employees, directors and consultants will terminate if not vested or exercised

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We adopted a 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2016 ESPP, in order to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock
	at a discount following the date of this offering. Purchases will be accomplished through participation in discrete offering periods. The 2016 ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section&nbsp;423 of the Code. We have
	reserved 210,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the 2016 ESPP. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 ESPP will increase automatically on January 1 of each calendar year beginning after the first offering date and
	continuing through the first ten calendar years by the number of shares equal to 1% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock as of the immediately preceding December&nbsp;31. However, our board of directors or compensation committee may
	reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. The aggregate number of shares issued over the term of the 2016 ESPP will not exceed 2,100,000 shares of our common stock.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our compensation committee will administer the 2016 ESPP. Our employees generally are eligible to participate in the 2016 ESPP. Our
	compensation committee may in its discretion elect to exclude employees who do not meet certain eligibility requirements under applicable law. Employees who are 5% stockholders, or would become 5% stockholders as a result of their participation in
	the 2016 ESPP, are ineligible to participate in the 2016 ESPP. We may impose additional restrictions on eligibility. Under the 2016 ESPP, eligible employees will be able to acquire shares of our common stock by accumulating funds through payroll
	deductions. Our eligible employees will be able to select a rate of payroll deduction between 1% and 15% of their eligible cash compensation. We will also have the right to amend or terminate the 2016 ESPP at any time. The 2016 ESPP will terminate
	on the tenth anniversary of the first purchase date under the 2016 ESPP unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors.

	The
	2016 ESPP is implemented through a series of offering periods under which our employees who meet the eligibility requirements for participation in that offering period will automatically be granted a nontransferable option to purchase shares in that
	offering period. For subsequent offering periods, new participants will be required to enroll in a timely manner. Once an employee is enrolled, participation will be automatic in subsequent offering periods. The time and duration of the offering
	periods and the purchase periods will be determined by the compensation committee, provided that an offering period will in no event be longer than 27 months, except as otherwise provided by an applicable subplan. Offering periods may be consecutive

	right is outstanding. In addition, no participant will be permitted to purchase more than 2,100 shares during any one purchase period or a lesser amount determined by our compensation committee. The purchase price for shares of our common stock
	purchased under the 2016 ESPP will be 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on (i)&nbsp;the first trading day of the applicable offering period and (ii)&nbsp;the last trading day of each purchase period in the applicable

	Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and
	preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock would enable our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt
	to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other means.

	payor, furnishing an incorrect identification number, or failing to report interest or dividends on his returns. The backup withholding tax rate is currently 28%. The backup withholding rules do not apply to payments to corporations, whether
	domestic or foreign, provided they establish such exemption.

	Until the distribution of the shares is completed, SEC rules may limit underwriters and selling group members from bidding for and purchasing
	our common stock. However, the representatives may engage in transactions that stabilize the price of the common stock, such as bids or purchases to peg, fix or maintain that price.

	In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell our common stock in the open market. These transactions may include
	short sales, purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering.
	&#147;Covered&#148; short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional shares described above. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to
	purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the
	open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the option granted to them. &#147;Naked&#148; short sales are sales in excess of such option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing
	shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of our common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect
	investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of shares of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering.

	The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the
	underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

	Similar to other purchase transactions, the underwriters&#146; purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or
	maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. The
	underwriters may conduct these transactions on the NASDAQ Global Market, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
	financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.

	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,

	Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., or the Company, was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November&nbsp;13, 2012. The Company is a
	biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing gene therapy products for patients suffering from serious, life-threatening rare diseases caused by single gene defects. The Company&#146;s principal operations are located in San
	Francisco, California, and it operates in one business segment.

	In the course of its
	development activities, the Company has sustained operating losses and expects such losses to continue over the next several years. The Company&#146;s ultimate success depends on the outcome of its research and development activities. The Company
	has incurred net losses from operations since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $40.7 million, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The Company intends to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity, and potentially through
	strategic alliances with partner companies. If financing is not available at adequate levels, the Company may need to reevaluate its operating plans. Management believes currently available resources will provide sufficient funds to enable the
	Company to meet its operating plans for at least the next twelve months. However, if the Company&#146;s anticipated operating results are not achieved in future periods, planned expenditures may need to be reduced in order to extend the time period
	over which the then-available resources would be able to fund the Company&#146;s operations.

	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of any expenses during the reporting period. On an
	ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to accrued liabilities, fair value of assets, common stock, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, and on
	various other market-specific relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

	The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of
	possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include: the length of time and extent to which the fair market value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects
	of the investee, credit quality, likelihood of recovery, and the Company&#146;s ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are
	included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in
	other income, net on the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company uses the specific-identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon sale of its marketable securities.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Fair
	value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A liability&#146;s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor,
	not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices, or parameters derived from such prices. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation
	models are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment. The degree of management estimation and judgment is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments, or market, and the
	instruments&#146; complexity. The authoritative accounting guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered
	unobservable. These levels of inputs are as follows:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 1&#151;Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 2&#151;Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are
	either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 3&#151;Unobservable inputs that reflect management&#146;s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset
	or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.

	The Company&#146;s contingent acquisition consideration payable (resulting from the Cardiogen acquisition (see
	Note 6)) is estimated using a probability-based income approach utilizing an appropriate discount rate. Key assumptions used by management to estimate the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payable include estimated probabilities,
	the estimated timing of when a milestone may be attained and assumed discount periods and rates. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable, resulting from management&#146;s revision of key assumptions,
	will be recorded in research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The probability-based income approach used by management to estimate the fair value of the contingent acquisition

	In August 2015, the Company acquired Cardiogen Sciences, Inc., or Cardiogen, a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development
	of AAV gene therapy products for rare, inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued 1,293,058 shares of common stock, of which 133,986 shares have been held back from the Cardiogen shareholders to cover
	potential indemnification requirements, as specified in the merger agreement, and 46,969 shares of Series B preferred stock. Additionally, upon first dosing of a patient in a human clinical study involving AT307 for the treatment of CASQ2-CPVT, the
	Company is obligated to pay to former Cardiogen shareholders $4.2 million in common stock plus an additional $5.8 million in either cash or common stock, at the Company&#146;s election, for aggregate contingent consideration of $10.0 million.

	The acquisition of Cardiogen was accounted for as the purchase of a business. The related acquisition costs, consisting primarily of
	legal and accounting expenses in the amount of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, were expensed. These legal and accounting expenses are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and

	The acquisition of Cardiogen provided the Company with certain intellectual property through the license agreement with FSM,
	including Cardiogen&#146;s lead program for CASQ2-CPVT. The Company determined that the fair value of such intellectual property was approximately $8.0 million. The fair value of the intellectual property was determined using the excess earnings
	approach. The excess earnings approach considers the economics related to the intellectual property. The assumptions underlying the fair value calculation include: estimated revenue attributable to the intellectual property, future research and
	development expenses, an estimated effective income tax rate and an estimated discount rate.

	Certain founding directors purchased 224,238 common shares that were subject to a repurchase right upon termination or cessation of services

	In 2012, the
	Company adopted the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, or Plan. Under the Plan, shares of the Company&#146;s common stock have been reserved for the issuance of stock options to employees, directors, and consultants under terms and provisions established
	by the Board of Directors. A total of 3,107,517&nbsp;shares were reserved for issuance under the 2012 Plan at December&nbsp;31, 2015, of which 751,661&nbsp;shares are available for future grant. Under the terms of the Plan, options may be granted at
	an exercise price not less than fair market value. For employees holding more than 10% of the voting rights of all classes of stock, the exercise prices for incentive and non-statutory stock options may not be less than 110% of fair market value, as
	determined by the Board of Directors. The terms of options granted under the Plan may not exceed ten years. The vesting schedule of newly issued option grants is typically 25% one year from the vesting commencement date and 1/48th&nbsp;per month
	thereafter. The following summarizes option activity under the 2012 Plan:

	Given the absence of a public trading market, the Board of Directors considered numerous objective and

<I>

	performed by unrelated third-party specialists;
	(ii)&nbsp;the prices for preferred stock sold to outside investors; (iii)&nbsp;the rights, preferences and privileges of preferred stock relative to common stock; (iv)&nbsp;the lack of marketability of common stock; (v)&nbsp;developments in the

	The Company&#146;s expected term represents the period that the Company&#146;s stock-based awards are expected to be

<I>
	Expected Volatility:
</I>
	Since the Company is privately held and does not have any trading history for its common stock, the expected
	volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar

	the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the &#147;change in ownership&#148; provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitations may

	The Company has incurred net operating losses since inception and has no significant unrecognized tax benefits. The Company&#146;s policy is
	to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for taxes in the statements of operations. If in the future the Company recognizes uncertain tax positions, the Company&#146;s effective tax rate
	will be reduced. Currently, the Company has a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future.
	Any adjustments to uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment of net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards rather than resulting in a cash outlay.

	Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
	period and excludes any dilutive effects of share-based awards. Diluted net loss per share is computed giving effect to all potential dilutive common shares, including common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options, convertible preferred
	stock, and unvested restricted common stock. As the Company had net losses for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, all potential common shares were determined to be anti-dilutive.

	In the course of its
	development activities, the Company has sustained operating losses and expects such losses to continue over the next several years. The Company&#146;s ultimate success depends on the outcome of its research and development activities. The Company
	has incurred net losses from operations since inception and as of March&nbsp;31, 2016, had an accumulated deficit of $51.2 million. The Company intends to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity, and potentially through
	strategic alliances with partner companies. If financing is not available at adequate levels, the Company may need to reevaluate its operating plans. Management believes its currently available resources will provide sufficient funds to enable the
	Company to meet its operating plans for at least the next twelve months. However, if the Company&#146;s anticipated operating results are not achieved in future periods, planned expenditures may need to be reduced in order to extend the time period
	over which the then-available resources would be able to fund the Company&#146;s operations.

	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or
	GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the
	date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of any expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to accrued liabilities, fair value of assets, common stock,
	income taxes, and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, and on various other market-specific relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, under the circumstances. Actual results may
	differ from those estimates.

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A
	liability&#146;s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Where available, fair value is based on observable
	market prices, or parameters derived from such prices. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment. The degree of management
	estimation and judgment is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments, or market, and the instruments&#146; complexity. The authoritative accounting guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be
	used to measure fair value, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable. These levels of inputs are as follows:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 1&#151;Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement
	date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 2&#151;Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or
	liability. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:7%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 3&#151;Unobservable inputs that reflect management&#146;s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or
	liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.
</P>

	Money market funds are valued using quoted market price, and are included in cash equivalents on the Company&#146;s balance sheets. Marketable
	securities are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and are included in cash equivalents and short-term
	investments on the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets.

	Deferred offering costs, consisting of legal, accounting, printer and filing fees related to the proposed IPO are capitalized. The deferred
	offering costs will be offset against proceeds from the IPO upon completion of the offering. In the event the offering is terminated, all capitalized deferred offering costs will be immediately expensed. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and
	March&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had $2.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of deferred offering costs, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

	The Company&#146;s contingent acquisition consideration payable, resulting from the acquisition of Cardiogen
	Sciences, Inc. in August 2015, is estimated using a probability-based income approach utilizing an appropriate discount rate. Key assumptions used by management to estimate the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payable include
	estimated probability of occurrence, the estimated timing of when the milestone may be attained and assumed discount period and discount rate. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable, resulting from
	management&#146;s revision of key assumptions will be recorded in research and development expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The probability-based income approach used by management to estimate the
	fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration is most sensitive to changes in the estimated probability of occurrence.

	connection with claims against such representatives in connection with their service to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates;

	. Subject to Sections 2.6 and 21 and any other applicable provisions hereof, the total number of
	Shares reserved and available for grant and issuance pursuant to this Plan as of the date of adoption of the Plan by the Board, is One Million Five Hundred Thousand (1,500,000)&nbsp;Shares, plus (a)&nbsp;any reserved Shares not issued or subject to

	Plan that are forfeited or are repurchased by the Company at the original issue price; (c)&nbsp;are subject to Awards granted under this Plan that otherwise terminate without such Shares being issued; or (d)&nbsp;are surrendered pursuant to an
	Exchange Program. To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash or other property rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Shares used to pay the
	exercise price of an Award or withheld to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an Award will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, Shares that otherwise become available for grant and
	issuance because of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.2 shall not include Shares subject to Awards that initially became available because of the substitution clause in Section&nbsp;21.2 hereof.

	may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (a)&nbsp;notice of exercise (in such form as the Committee may specify from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise the Option
	(and/or via electronic execution through the authorized third party administrator), and (b)&nbsp;full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (together with applicable withholding taxes). Full payment may consist of any
	consideration and method of payment authorized by the Committee and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by
	the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares, notwithstanding the exercise
	of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except
	as provided in Section&nbsp;2.6 of the Plan. Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is
	exercised.

	deemed automatically exercised by the Company as of the 90th day following such termination, provided that the Company may notify Participant that it is exercising its Repurchase Right as of a date prior to such 90th day. Unless Participant is
	otherwise notified by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence that the Company does not intend to exercise its Repurchase Right as to some or all of the Unvested Shares, execution of this Agreement by Participant constitutes written notice to
	Participant of the Company&#146;s intention to exercise its Repurchase Right with respect to all Unvested Shares to which such Repurchase Right applies at the time of termination of Participant&#146;s Service. The Company, at its choice, may satisfy
	its payment obligation to Participant with respect to exercise of the Repurchase Right by (i)&nbsp;delivering a check to Participant in the amount of the purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased, (ii)&nbsp;in the event Participant is
	indebted to the Company, canceling an amount of such indebtedness equal to the purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased (if and to the extent permitted by applicable law), (iii)&nbsp;in the event Participant purchased Unvested Shares

	cancellation of indebtedness equals such purchase price. In the event of any deemed automatic exercise of the Repurchase Right by canceling an amount of such indebtedness equal to the purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased, such
	cancellation of indebtedness will be deemed automatically to occur as of the 90th day following termination of Participant&#146;s employment or consulting relationship unless the Company otherwise satisfies its payment obligations. As a result of
	any repurchase of Unvested Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Right, the Company will become the legal and beneficial owner of the Unvested Shares being repurchased and will have all rights and interest therein or related thereto, and the Company
	will have the right to transfer to its own name the number of Unvested Shares being repurchased by the Company, without further action by Participant.

	1. Establishment of Plan
</B>
	. Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;
<B>
<I>
	Company
</I>
</B>
	&#148;) proposes to grant
	options to purchase shares of Common Stock to eligible employees of the Company and its Participating Corporations pursuant to this Plan. The Company intends this Plan to qualify as an &#147;employee stock purchase plan&#148; under Code
	Section&nbsp;423 (including any amendments to or replacements of such Section), and this Plan shall be so construed. Any term not expressly defined in this Plan but defined for purposes of Code Section&nbsp;423 shall have the same definition herein.
	However, with regard to offers of options for purchase of the Common Stock under the Plan to employees outside the United States working for a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of the Company, the Board may offer a subplan or an option that is not intended
	to meet the Code Section&nbsp;423 requirements, provided, if necessary under Code Section&nbsp;423, that the other terms and conditions of the Plan are met. Subject to Section&nbsp;14, a total of Two Hundred Ten Thousand (210,000)&nbsp;shares of
	Common Stock is reserved for issuance under this Plan. In addition, on each January&nbsp;1 for the first ten (10)&nbsp;calendar years after the first Offering Date, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan
	shall be increased automatically by the number of shares equal to one percent (1%)&nbsp;of the total number of outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock on the immediately preceding December&nbsp;31 (rounded down to the nearest whole share);
<U>
	provided,
</U>
	that the Board or the Committee may in its sole discretion reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year; and,
<U>
	provided further
</U>
	, that the aggregate number of shares issued over the term of this Plan shall not
	exceed Two Million One Hundred Thousand (2,100,000)&nbsp;shares of Common Stock. The number of shares reserved for issuance under this Plan and the maximum number of shares that may be issued under this Plan shall be subject to adjustments effected
	in accordance with Section&nbsp;14 of this Plan. Capitalized terms not defined elsewhere in the text are defined in Section&nbsp;27.

<B>
	2. Purpose
</B>
	. The purpose of this Plan is to provide eligible employees of the Company and Participating Corporations with a means of
	acquiring an equity interest in the Company through payroll deductions, to enhance such employees&#146; sense of participation in the affairs of the Company and Participating Corporations, and to provide an incentive for continued employment.

<B>
	3. Administration
</B>
	. The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board or by the Board (either referred to herein
	as the &#147;
<B>
<I>
	Committee
</I>
</B>
	&#148;). Subject to the provisions of this Plan and the limitations of Section&nbsp;423 of the Code or any successor provision in the Code, all questions of interpretation or application of this Plan shall be
	determined by the Committee and its decisions shall be final and binding upon all Participants. The Committee will have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to determine eligibility and
	decide upon any and all claims filed under the Plan. Every finding, decision and determination made by the Committee will, to the full extent permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
	this Plan, the Committee may adopt rules and/or procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate requirements of local law and procedures outside of the United States. The Committee will have the authority to
	determine the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock (which determination shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes) in accordance with Section&nbsp;8 below and to interpret Section&nbsp;8 of the Plan in connection with circumstances
	that impact the Fair Market Value. Members of the Committee shall receive no compensation for their services in connection with the administration of this Plan, other than standard fees as established from time to time by the Board for services
	rendered by Board members serving on the Board or its committees. All expenses incurred in connection with the administration of this Plan shall be paid by the Company. For purposes of this Plan, the Committee may designate separate offerings under
	the Plan (the terms of which need not be identical) in which eligible employees of one or more Participating Corporations will participate, even if the dates of the applicable Offering Periods of each such offering are identical.

	25. Amendment or Termination

	of Common Stock, shall be returned to those Participants (without interest thereon, except as otherwise required under local laws) as soon as administratively practicable. Further, the Committee will be entitled to establish rules to change the
	Purchase Periods and Offering Periods, limit the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount contributed during a Purchase Period or an Offering Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts contributed in a currency other than
	U.S. dollars, permit payroll withholding in excess of the amount designated by a Participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the administration of the Plan, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and
	crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of Common Stock for each Participant properly correspond with amounts contributed from the Participant&#146;s base salary or regular hourly wages, and establish such other
	limitations or procedures as the Committee determines in its sole discretion advisable which are consistent with the Plan. Such actions will not require stockholder approval or the consent of any Participants. However, no amendment shall be made

	consequences including, but not limited to: (i)&nbsp;amending the definition of compensation, including with respect to an Offering Period underway at the time; (ii)&nbsp;altering the Purchase Price for any Offering Period including an Offering

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	California Labor Code Section&nbsp;2870 provides as follows:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her
	rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer&#146;s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those
	inventions that either: (1)&nbsp;relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer&#146;s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or (2)&nbsp;result from any
	work performed by the employee for the employer. To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under California Labor Code
	Section&nbsp;2870(a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Alternative structures for plasmids used during transient transfection to produce AAV. No patent was filed yet, as the project is still in process by
	Dr.&nbsp;Davidoff&#146;s group. Dr.&nbsp;Davidoff wishes for this work to continue and I think it may be broadly useful. Only some of the ideas that I had for improving the structure of the plasmids were included in the invention disclosure.

	Software utilities/computer files:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The vast majority have very
	close to zero market value (are they really inventions, then?), and are only useful to me as tools for the way I like to work. The software was written piecemeal over the past 17 years at both Harvard and St. Jude. If Audentes wished to have tools
	like these as integral to its business, I am certain they would have to be re-written.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pre-existing vector designs and natural sequence maps. I have a
	library of DNA sequence maps which were generated over many years and which are useful for me to review what has worked and what has not. Again the designs themselves probably have zero market value but help me to understand the origins of various
	different vectors that others are using.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	One script which may have some market value was written when I was a Harvard employee. It is used for designing
	synthetic coding sequences, and was used to derive the St. Jude human Factor IX vector.

	Ideas for developing software that could be used in combination with the synthetic gene design software mentioned above to
	further enhance the expression of the designed gene. Highly speculative but also potentially very valuable.
