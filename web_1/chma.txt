	We are a
	late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of patients suffering from orphan diseases by developing and commercializing novel oral forms of therapies that are available today only by injection. Using our proprietary
	Transient Permeability Enhancer, or TPE, technology platform, we seek to develop oral therapies that eliminate the significant limitations and burdens generally associated with existing injectable therapies. We have completed a multinational Phase 3
	clinical trial of our most advanced TPE platform-based product candidate, oral octreotide capsules (conditionally trade named MYCAPSSA, and referred to herein as octreotide capsules), for the treatment of acromegaly, a condition that results in the
	body&#146;s production of excess growth hormone. Octreotide is an analog of somatostatin, a natural inhibitor of growth hormone secretion. We believe that our lead product candidate, if approved by regulatory authorities, will be the first
	somatostatin analog available for oral administration. Our octreotide capsules product candidate has been granted orphan designation in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of acromegaly. We submitted a new drug application, or
	NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on June&nbsp;15, 2015, seeking approval for the marketing and sale of octreotide capsules for the maintenance therapy of adult patients with acromegaly. On August&nbsp;14, 2015, we received
	notice from the FDA that our NDA was accepted for filing to permit a substantive review. The FDA has granted a standard 505(b)(2) review for the NDA and has set a target review date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of
	April&nbsp;15, 2016. In light of our clinical data and feedback from patients and healthcare providers, we believe that octreotide capsules, if approved, could become a new standard of care in acromegaly.

	Acromegaly is a condition caused by a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that releases excess growth hormone, or GH, which in turn elevates insulin-like
	growth factor 1, or IGF-1. These elevated hormone levels result in a number of painful and disfiguring symptoms, including some acute, such as headaches, joint pain and fatigue, and some long-term, such as enlarged hands, feet and internal organs,
	as well as altered facial features. If not treated promptly, acromegaly can lead to serious illness and is associated with premature death, primarily due to cardiovascular disease. According to data published by the Mayo Clinic in 2013, the
	mortality rate of people afflicted by acromegaly who go untreated is two to three times higher than that of the general population. Recent

	data from a published study presented at the Endocrine Society&#146;s Annual Meeting in 2015 suggest that the global prevalence of acromegaly may be between 85 and 118 cases per million people.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The current standard of care for patients diagnosed with acromegaly and not otherwise cured by surgery consists of lifelong, once-monthly injections of
	an extended release somatostatin analog, primarily octreotide or lanreotide. These products contain a viscous formulation and are typically administered by a healthcare professional with large-gauge needles into the muscle or deep subcutaneously,
	that is, deeply under the skin. While injectable somatostatin analogs are generally effective at reducing GH and IGF-1 levels and therefore providing disease control, the injections are associated with significant limitations and patient burdens,
	including suboptimal symptom control, pain, injection-site reactions and other injection-related side effects, inconvenience, lost work days and emotional issues. The worldwide market for injectable somatostatin analogs is approximately $2.2 billion
	annually, of which we estimate approximately $730 million represents annual sales for the treatment of acromegaly.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead product candidate, octreotide
	capsules or MYCAPSSA, is the first somatostatin analog formulated for oral administration to complete a Phase 3 clinical trial and demonstrate clinical proof of concept in treating patients with acromegaly. In our initial Phase 3 clinical trial, we
	observed that octreotide capsules maintained reduced levels of GH and IGF-1, or biochemical disease response, and improved symptom control. In this

	Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate
	octreotide capsules in acromegaly patients previously controlled on injectable somatostatin analogs, 65% of patients receiving octreotide capsules twice a day for up to seven months achieved the primary endpoint, maintenance of biochemical response.
	This biochemical response was durable and 86% of patients who completed the seven-month core treatment period of the trial elected to continue on oral therapy during the six-month extension phase for up to a total of 13 months of treatment after
	first dosing, rather than switch back to injections. In the majority of patients in our trial, octreotide capsules achieved comparable biochemical response and reduced incidence and severity of acromegaly symptoms relative to injectable somatostatin
	analogs currently used to treat this disease. The adverse events observed for octreotide capsules were similar to those previously reported for injectable somatostatin analogs, but without injection-site reactions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based in part on the data from our Phase 3 clinical trial, we submitted an NDA on June&nbsp;15, 2015 seeking approval for the marketing and sale of octreotide
	capsules for the maintenance therapy of adult patients with acromegaly. We anticipate a regulatory decision by the FDA on marketing approval on the PDUFA date of April&nbsp;15, 2016. To support approval by the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA,
	we initiated an additional international Phase 3 clinical trial of octreotide capsules in acromegaly in March 2016 to show parallel comparative safety and effectiveness as required by the EMA. Assuming we receive favorable results from this second
	Phase 3 clinical trial, we expect to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the EMA in 2019. In addition, if we receive regulatory approval of octreotide capsules in acromegaly, we expect to initiate a clinical trial in the second
	half of 2016 to support development for neuroendocrine tumors, or NET, which are currently treated predominantly by injectable somatostatin analogs, and a clinical trial in 2017 for another new indication.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that approximately 8,000 adult acromegaly patients are chronically treated with somatostatin analogs in the United States, and that approximately
	90% of these patients are managed by fewer than 1,000 accounts. Patients with acromegaly undergoing treatment in the United States are treated by endocrinologists at&nbsp;a small number of&nbsp;academic institutions with pituitary experts (pituitary
	centers), regional academic centers or hospital systems (regional referral centers) and some community endocrinologists. We believe we will be able to market octreotide capsules, if approved, directly to pituitary centers, regional referral centers
	and high-volume community endocrinologists through our own targeted sales force.&nbsp;We also intend to engage in direct patient outreach efforts. We believe that the clinical benefits and preferences of patients and healthcare professionals for an
	oral product together with our patient-centric approach could enable octreotide capsules, if approved, to become a new standard of care in acromegaly.

	We retain worldwide rights to develop and commercialize octreotide capsules with no royalty obligations to third
	parties. We intend to commercialize octreotide capsules ourselves in the United States and we plan to explore the strategic merits of collaboration opportunities for commercializing octreotide capsules in Europe and the rest of the world. Octreotide
	capsules is currently protected by issued patents lasting until at least 2029 in the United&nbsp;States, United Kingdom and Japan, and pending patent applications in additional jurisdictions that will last until 2029, if granted. We are also
	pursuing additional patent applications relating to particular uses, dosages and packaging for octreotide capsules.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also intend to use our TPE
	platform to develop other oral medications, beyond octreotide capsules, to help improve the lives of patients suffering from other debilitating diseases that are currently being treated with injectable therapies. In contrast to conventional small
	molecule drugs, the oral absorption of larger molecules, such as peptides and other protein molecules, is limited due to low intestinal permeability and digestion in the stomach and intestine. Our TPE platform transiently enhances intestine
	permeability, allowing peptides and other drugs that are otherwise poorly absorbed when administered orally to pass through the intestine and reach therapeutic levels in the blood. We believe our TPE platform is particularly well suited to therapies
	used in chronic indications for which injections are required and for which the active agent can be administered without adverse safety implications. While our technology will not be appropriate for all drugs that cannot currently be administered
	orally, based on our nonclinical proof of concept data, we believe that we can administer a number of peptide-based drugs orally using our TPE technology and achieve therapeutic levels in the blood.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As we consider new peptide-based drugs to develop using our TPE platform, to reduce the development time and expenses and overall level of investment
	required, where possible, we intend to focus our efforts on drugs for which we may utilize the FDA&#146;s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the United States and the hybrid application pathway, which is analogous to the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway,
	in Europe. With octreotide capsules, we brought a TPE-based product candidate from concept to the first clinical trial within 18 months and then initiated a Phase 3 study approximately two years later.

	Leveraging our TPE platform, we have developed a pipeline of oral product candidates. Our most advanced product candidate is MYCAPSSA (octreotide capsules) for

	additional clinical trials of octreotide capsules in a new orphan indication, once selected, in 2017. We have also identified several peptides currently available only in injectable forms that we believe we can develop into oral formulations with
	our TPE technology, using a similar development strategy as we employed with octreotide capsules. We have obtained nonclinical proof of concept data for various peptides, currently available as injections, and are conducting further nonclinical

	Our lead product candidate, octreotide capsules or MYCAPSSA, has completed a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of acromegaly. In June 2015, we submitted
	our NDA for octreotide capsules as a maintenance therapy for acromegaly in the United States. On August&nbsp;14, 2015, we received notice from the FDA that our NDA was accepted for filing to permit a substantive review. The FDA has granted a
	standard review for the NDA and has set a target review date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of April&nbsp;15, 2016. We anticipate a regulatory decision on marketing approval on April&nbsp;15, 2016. In addition to the clinical
	data we submitted to the FDA, the EMA has advised us that a clinical trial demonstrating non-inferiority of octreotide capsules compared to injectable somatostatin analogs as active controls will be required prior to regulatory approval. We have
	agreed on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol with the EMA and we initiated this trial in March of 2016. If successful, we expect to submit our MAA to the EMA in 2019.

	Overview of Acromegaly
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Acromegaly results from
	the overproduction of GH, most often due to the growth of a benign tumor in the pituitary gland in middle-aged adults. GH, in turn, stimulates the production of IGF-1 in the liver which stimulates the growth of bones and other tissues.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Progression of acromegaly can result in significant health problems such as hypertension, enlargement of the heart, or cardiomyopathy, sleep apnea, type-2
	diabetes, and abnormal growths in the colon and uterus. Acromegaly is associated with a number of symptoms, some acute, such as headaches, joint pain and fatigue, and some long-term, such as enlarged hands, feet and internal organs, as well as
	altered facial features. Because acromegaly is uncommon and physical changes occur gradually, the condition is often not recognized immediately, sometimes not for years. If not treated promptly, acromegaly can lead to serious illness and is
	associated with premature death, primarily due to cardiovascular disease. However, both surgical and drug treatments are available for acromegaly that can reduce the risk of complications and premature death and significantly improve symptom
	control.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Surgery is often the first line of therapy for acromegaly and, in most cases, surgical removal of the pituitary tumor can result in
	normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. In many other cases, however, the levels of GH remain elevated even after surgery due to residual tumor and many patients therefore also require a therapeutic intervention. The body&#146;s natural inhibitor of
	excess GH secretion is somatostatin, a peptide hormone. Octreotide and lanreotide, analogs of somatostatin with a significantly longer half-life in the blood than natural somatostatin, have achieved widespread adoption by physicians treating
	patients afflicted with acromegaly. These somatostatin analogs are routinely administered by injection by a healthcare professional. If not administered with proper technique, the injection may not effectively deliver the medication. There is
	currently no oral formulation of a somatostatin analog on the market and none, we believe, in clinical development except octreotide capsules.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There are an estimated 69,000 individuals with acromegaly worldwide. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, estimates that there are roughly 20,000
	individuals with acromegaly in the United States, based on its published prevalence of an estimated 60 cases per million. In thirteen studies of acromegaly prevalence since 1980, an average of approximately 75 cases per million was determined,
	suggesting roughly 24,000 individuals with acromegaly in the United States. However, recent data presented at the Endocrine Society&#146;s Annual Meeting in 2015 suggest that pituitary tumors may be more prevalent than previously thought, and that
	the global prevalence of acromegaly may be higher, between 85 and 118 cases per million people. NIH also cites an annual incidence of three to four new cases per million each year.

	According to publicly available financial reports, injectable forms of octreotide and lanreotide generate worldwide sales of approximately $2.2 billion

	large-gauge needles. Although we are initially targeting acromegaly with octreotide capsules, we believe that this product candidate, if approved, has the potential to become a standard of care for other indications currently treated primarily with

	For acromegaly patients not cured by surgery, the current standard of care involves injectable somatostatin analogs.&nbsp;These therapies are associated with
	significant patient limitations and burdens. Currently, the first therapeutic treatment options are octreotide, marketed by Novartis AG, or Novartis, which is administered monthly and intramuscularly using a large gauge needle, and lanreotide,
	marketed by Ipsen SA, or Ipsen, another long-acting analog of somatostatin, which is administered monthly using a deep subcutaneous injection. For patients not controlled on these somatostatin analogs, the typical second line of treatment options
	includes pegvisomant daily injections, marketed by Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, and pasireotide LAR, marketed by Novartis, which is another somatostatin analog administered via intramuscular injection.

	Octreotide capsules is
	a novel formulation of octreotide developed utilizing our TPE platform. We are developing octreotide capsules as a liquid-filled solid gelatin capsule formulation which is intended to be taken twice a day. We expect that acromegaly patients who are
	prescribed octreotide capsules, if approved, will receive a 28-day supply of pills, which may be stored at room temperature by the patient for up to one month. Based on the data from our clinical trials, we believe octreotide capsules have the
	potential to deliver biochemical response while improving symptoms and reducing the burden of disease and treatment in patients afflicted with acromegaly.

	We are seeking regulatory
	approval of octreotide capsules for the maintenance therapy of acromegaly in the United States utilizing the FDA&#146;s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The 505(b)(2) pathway enables us to rely, in part, on the FDA&#146;s prior findings of safety and
	efficacy of an approved product, or published literature, in support of our NDA. In the case of octreotide capsules in acromegaly, the approved product to which our NDA submission refers is the short-acting subcutaneous injectable formulation of
	octreotide that was the original product approved by the FDA before the long-acting formulation was developed. Since this formulation of octreotide has been approved by the FDA in generic form and is therefore no longer proprietary, we are not aware
	of any third party from which we would be required to obtain any license or acquire any rights to commercialize octreotide capsules, if approved. We have conducted a series of Phase 1 clinical trials, including a trial to demonstrate that the
	bioavailability of octreotide administered in our TPE formulation is comparable to the bioavailability of octreotide administered in the short-acting subcutaneous injectable formulation. We have also conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate
	the bioactivity of octreotide capsules in healthy subjects, and a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide capsules in patients with acromegaly, consisting of seven months of treatment plus an optional six-month
	extension phase.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2014, we met with the FDA to discuss our clinical development of octreotide capsules, including the full 13-month data from
	our Phase 3 clinical trial. At this meeting, the FDA advised us that it had not identified an issue that would preclude us from submitting an NDA for review. Accordingly, we submitted our NDA for octreotide capsules for maintenance therapy in
	acromegaly to the FDA on June&nbsp;15, 2015. On August&nbsp;14, 2015, we received notice from the FDA that our NDA was accepted for filing to permit a substantive review. The FDA has granted a standard review for the NDA and has set a target review
	date under the PDUFA date of April&nbsp;15, 2016.

	Europe utilizing the hybrid application pathway, which is analogous to the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the United States. In addition to the clinical data we submitted to the FDA, the EMA has advised us that a clinical trial demonstrating
	non-inferiority of octreotide capsules compared to injectable somatostatin analogs as active controls will be required prior to regulatory approval by EMA. Our Phase 3 clinical trial protocol has been accepted by the EMA and we initiated this trial
	in March of 2016. If successful, we expect to submit an MAA to the EMA in 2019.

	In March 2012, we initiated a Phase 3 multi-center, open-label, baseline-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide capsules
	in patients with acromegaly who responded to and tolerated treatment with somatostatin analogs. We completed this trial in November 2014 and the results were published in the

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A total of 155 patients with acromegaly, each of whom was classified as a responder to a long-acting injectable somatostatin analog, were enrolled in the
	trial. Two weeks after their last monthly injection of the long-acting injectable somatostatin analog, patients were reassessed to obtain baseline IGF-1 and GH levels. Both the screening and baseline measurements were performed while patients were
	still on active injection therapy. The 155 patients enrolled in the trial are referred to as the intent to treat, or ITT, group.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After baseline levels
	were obtained, no less than one month following their last monthly injection of the long-acting injectable somatostatin analog, a core treatment period with octreotide capsules was initiated. This core treatment period consisted of a dose-escalation
	phase of at least two months in duration, designed to find an appropriate dose of octreotide capsules for each individual patient, and a fixed-dose phase of up to five months in duration, during which period the appropriate therapeutic dose
	identified in the dose-escalation phase was maintained. Since data from our prior clinical trials demonstrated a significant reduction in bioavailability when octreotide capsules is administered with a high-fat meal, patients in this Phase 3
	clinical trial were required to fast for at least one hour before and at least one to two hours after each dose.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Patients who entered the core treatment
	phase of the trial initially received a 40 mg daily dose (administered in two pills a day), which was increased to daily doses of 60 mg or 80 mg on an as-required basis to maintain biochemical response and/or symptom control, at the discretion of
	the investigator. For each patient, the core treatment phase lasted for seven months after his or her first dose of octreotide capsules. Patients could then opt to continue treatment with octreotide capsules during an extension period of up to an
	additional six months, with a two-week period for final follow-up. Four patients dropped out of the trial after receiving at least one dose of octreotide capsules but before a biochemical response could be measured, resulting in a modified intent to
	treat, or mITT, group of 151 patients.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The primary objective of the trial was to determine the efficacy of octreotide capsules in patients with
	acromegaly, as measured by effect on IGF-1 and GH levels, with responders defined as patients who achieve an IGF-1 level less than 1.3 times the upper limit of normal, or ULN, adjusted for age and an integrated GH level over two hours less than 2.5
	ng/mL. Secondary objectives included assessment of safety and tolerability of octreotide capsules, and comparison of efficacy of octreotide capsules versus long-acting injectable somatostatin analog.

	Of the
	155 patients enrolled, four were not evaluable and of the 151 in the mITT group, 49 patients discontinued, the majority during the dose-escalation phase. Of the 151 patients in the mITT group, patients discontinued for a variety of reasons,
	including treatment failures because the patient could not be controlled on 80 mg, the highest dose available (24); withdrawals due to adverse events (18);&nbsp;or patient choice, sponsor request and lost to follow up (7). Of the 110 patients that
	completed the dose-escalation phase, 52 patients, or 47%, were receiving the 40&nbsp;mg daily dose, 25 patients, or 23%, were receiving the 60 mg dose, and 33 patients, or 30%, were receiving the 80 mg dose.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After completion of the dose-escalation phase, the remaining 110 patients entered the fixed dose phase of the core treatment period and continued on
	octreotide capsules at their respective doses until seven months after first dosing. A total of 102 patients completed the fixed dose phase of the trial, 88 of whom, or 86%, voluntarily chose to remain on octreotide capsules during the six-month
	extension phase, for a total of 13 months of treatment after first dosing. A total of 82 patients completed the six-month extension phase of the trial.

	Overall, 65% of patients in the mITT group were classified as responders at the end of the seven-month core treatment phase, which was the primary endpoint
	for the trial. Applying a worst-case imputation method, whereby all patients who withdrew from the study prematurely (regardless of reason) are treated as non-responders, 53% of patients were classified as responders at the end of the seven-month
	core treatment phase. By the end of the six-month extension phase, or 13 months after first dosing, the responder rate was 62% in the mITT group. Of the 110 patients that completed the dose-escalation phase, and therefore received an optimized dose
	of oral octreotride, 75% were classified as responders. For all 151 patients included in the mITT group, the responder rate on long-acting injectable somatostatin analogs was 89% at baseline, prior to initiation of octreotide capsules.
	Endocrinologists indicated that effectiveness in at least 50% of patients treated would be sufficient for an oral treatment to be successful.

	We also assessed control of acromegaly symptoms, the incidence of symptoms, and the severity and number of symptoms in
	patients using octreotide capsules in a retrospective analysis performed after completion of the trial. At baseline, 81% of patients in the mITT group, the majority of whom were classified as responders, still had acromegaly symptoms, such as
	headaches, excessive perspiration, muscle weakness and/or joint pain and swelling. Patients who completed 13 months of treatment reported significantly fewer acromegaly symptoms at the conclusion of the trial than at the time of their baseline
	screening, and this result was statistically significant, with p-values of less than 0.020. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 or less is generally
	considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than 1-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. There was also a reduction in the severity of symptoms reported. In addition, breakthrough, or
	returning, symptoms of acromegaly were reported by 36% of patients receiving injections at baseline compared to 22% at 13 months on octreotide capsules through a questionnaire conducted in a subset of the patients in the clinical trial.

	may have an additive effective to somatostatin analogs. This sub-study, which the EMA did not accept as part of the final protocol for comparative effectiveness, is unlikely to be sufficient to gain regulatory approval for the combination of both

	If we receive
	regulatory approval for octreotide capsules in acromegaly, we plan to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, and initiate a clinical trial to support the development of octreotide capsules in NET in the second half of 2016. We
	believe that the data generated in the Phase 1 clinical trials of octreotide capsules that we have conducted, coupled with the Phase 3 clinical trial data we have generated for octreotide capsules in acromegaly, will be sufficient for us to move to
	clinical development for NET. In addition, we intend to initiate clinical trials of octreotide capsules in a new orphan indication, once selected, in 2017.

	NETs are formed by hormone-producing cells in the body&#146;s neuroendocrine system. NETs most frequently form in tissues derived from the embryonic gut such
	as small intestine, appendix, proximal colon and pancreas. According to an article published in the
<I>
	Journal of Clinical Oncology
</I>
	in 2008, the prevalence of NETs in the United States is estimated to be 5.25 cases per 100,000 people. Over 70%
	of NETs from the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas express somatostatin receptors. Injectable somatostatin analogs have been approved for the treatment of symptom relief of NETs, mainly for a type known as carcinoids. NETs are associated with
	numerous clinical symptoms, the most debilitating of which is frequent diarrhea.&nbsp;Approximately 80% of patients experience frequent watery stools up to 30 times a day accompanied by abdominal cramping. Approximately 85% of patients also
	experience episodic flushing resulting in red to violet coloration of the head, neck and upper chest and a mild burning sensation. This flushing can also lead to reduced blood pressure.&nbsp;Two injectable forms of somatostatin analogs marketed by
	Novartis are currently the only approved therapies for relief of these symptoms.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Until recently, somatostatin analogs have been indicated only for the
	treatment of symptoms of carcinoid or gastroentero-NETs. In December 2014, the FDA expanded the label for lanreotide to include the treatment of patients with pancreatic NETs based on its ability to improve progression-free survival in otherwise
	untreatable cases. This expanded label is expected to result in a substantial increase in the number of NET patients treated with somatostatin analogs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Octreotide is known to be effective in controlling symptoms of NETs. It is the standard of care for carcinoid, a form of NET, and related symptoms.
	Approximately 50% of somatostatin analog sales, or more than $1.0&nbsp;billion annually, are estimated to be associated with treatment of NET and we believe that octreotide capsules have the potential to capture a significant portion of this market.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our Transient Permeability Enhancer, or TPE, technology is a proprietary platform, developed internally by our scientists, that enhances the absorption through
	the intestinal wall of drugs that otherwise would not be absorbed efficiently by that route. Using our TPE technology, we can transiently and reversibly open the so-called tight junctions between the cells lining the inner intestinal wall, enabling
	drug molecules to be absorbed intact. Our TPE formulation is a suspension of water-soluble particles containing a precise combination of medium-chain fatty acid salts and drug substance in a fat-soluble medium. In creating a TPE formulation, we make
	no chemical modifications to the drug substance.

	Oral delivery of peptides and nucleic acids is limited due to their inherent vulnerability to digestive processes
	and their poor intestinal absorption. The same intestinal absorption limitation applies to certain small molecules that have poor bioavailability. The cells at the surface of the intestine, columnar epithelial cells, are connected by tight junctions
	that form a barrier preventing permeation by water-soluble molecules as well as by viruses and bacteria. Our TPE technology induces the transient opening of these tight junctions, allowing peptides and other macromolecules up to a certain size, but
	not toxins, viruses and bacteria, to cross the intestinal barrier and enabling access to the blood.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The permeability of intestinal tight junctions is
	known to be altered by a number of dietary factors such as fatty acids, polysaccharides and flavonoids. Transient, reversible opening of the tight junctions and an increase in epithelial permeability are a normal part of intestinal physiology. These
	permeability adjustments allow the gut to balance two opposing functions: creating a barrier to the passage of microorganisms while facilitating the absorption of nutrients following a meal. In developing the TPE platform, our goal was to establish
	the ability to reproducibly induce transient increases in the permeability of tight junctions, allowing absorption of specifically formulated drug molecules.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have conducted extensive nonclinical studies to demonstrate the ability of our TPE technology to increase the permeability of the intestinal epithelial
	layer and therefore absorb molecules of different shapes, sizes and doses. As a result of these studies, we believe that our TPE technology can be applied to multiple additional peptide drug products as well as small molecules with poor

	In January 2013, we entered into a license agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., collectively Roche, for the development and
	commercialization of octreotide capsules. Under the terms of the license agreement, we had responsibility for continued clinical development through completion of our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, establishment of commercial-scale manufacturing and
	completion of ongoing nonclinical activities. Roche assumed responsibility for development and commercialization thereafter. The agreement provided for an upfront payment of $65.0 million, future consideration of up to $530 million in development
	and commercial milestones, and the right to receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales of octreotide capsules.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In January 2014, we received the

	oral therapy. In May 2014, Roche conducted a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA. In July 2014, Roche elected to terminate the license agreement and transitioned octreotide capsules and all materials related to the clinical development programs back to us.
	We subsequently entered into a termination agreement with Roche, which included our purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredient for future manufacturing of octreotide capsules and a trademark associated with octreotide capsules for an aggregate of

	Commercialization Strategy

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We retain worldwide rights to
	develop and commercialize octreotide capsules with no royalty obligations to third parties. We intend to commercialize octreotide capsules ourselves in the United States employing a strategy that differentiates our product candidate, if approved,
	and is tailored to the needs of patients and their physicians.&nbsp;We have been conducting market research and other pre-commercial activities in the United States since 2010 to better understand satisfaction levels and key unmet needs with respect
	to current treatments for acromegaly and to build awareness of octreotide capsules.&nbsp;This market research has been conducted with endocrinologists, nurses and people with acromegaly.&nbsp;In surveys commissioned by us, more than 80% of people
	with acromegaly expressed a preference for an oral treatment, and endocrinologists surveyed predicted that an oral treatment would ultimately become the preferred treatment option. Endocrinologists indicated that effectiveness in at least 50% of
	patients treated would be sufficient for an oral treatment to be successful. To assess the attitudes of commercial third-party payors&#146; toward reimbursement for octreotide capsules, in 2010 we conducted research with 12 such payors collectively
	representing 111&nbsp;million covered lives. Payors representing nearly 90% of these covered lives said they would reimburse an oral treatment assuming pricing was in a range comparable to the existing injectable therapy market leader, octreotide.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe the current U.S. market for acromegaly treatments is concentrated.&nbsp;We believe that approximately 8,000 adult acromegaly patients are
	chronically treated with somatostatin analogs in the United States, and that approximately 90% of these patients are managed by fewer than 1,000 accounts. Patients with acromegaly undergoing treatment in the United States are treated by
	endocrinologists at&nbsp;a small number of&nbsp;academic institutions with pituitary experts (pituitary centers), regional academic centers or hospital systems (regional referral centers) and some community endocrinologists. We believe we will be
	able to market octreotide capsules, if approved, directly to pituitary centers, regional referral centers and high-volume community endocrinologists through our own targeted sales force.&nbsp;We also intend to engage in direct patient outreach
	efforts. We believe that the clinical benefits and preferences of patients and healthcare professionals for an oral therapy together with our patient-centric approach could enable octreotide capsules, if approved, to become a new standard of care in
	acromegaly.

	takes effect on May&nbsp;13, 2015. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by
	terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.

	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to
	other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial
	time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These
	sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product
	seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material

	The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical
	development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory,
	which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing
	information, analytical data, any available clinical data or published literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to
	humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions
	regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The clinical stage of development involves the
	administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers and/or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#146;s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the
	requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing
	procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
	Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights
	of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must
	be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completion. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results
	to public registries.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, and may
	overlap. Phase 1 generally involves a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these studies is to assess the metabolism, pharmacological
	action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and
	pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, and are designed
	to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3
	trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials
	are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial
	marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety
	reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	testing that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug and any clinically
	important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
	The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can
	suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
	Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial
	may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.

	Following trial completion,
	trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA in an NDA along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing process and
	facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain proof of safety,
	purity, potency and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive nonclinical and clinical testing. The application includes both negative or ambiguous results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come
	from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must
	be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees
	may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before marketing a drug in the United States.

	In addition,
	under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and
	administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. An NDA applicant must submit to the FDA a pediatric study plan typically 60
	days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the agency. Because octreotide capsules received orphan drug designation for the treatment of acromegaly, we do not need to comply with the requirements of PREA at this time. If, however, we seek other

	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA
	must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The decision to accept the NDA for filing means that the FDA has made a
	threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the receipt of an
	NDA for a non-new molecular entity in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by
	FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among

	may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a
	recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval
	inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP
	requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA
	evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for
	specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific
	deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical
	trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application or request a hearing. Even if
	such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we
	interpret the same data.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States, and we may
	encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which
	could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed
	labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which
	involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on

	these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur

	Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway for the FDA to approve a new drug and permits reliance for such approval on
	published literature or an FDA finding of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product. Specifically, section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval
	were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and/or the FDA&#146;s findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug.
	Typically, 505(b)(2) applicants must perform additional trials to support the change from the previously approved drug and to further demonstrate the new drug&#146;s safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for
	all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the section 505(b)(2) applicant.

	Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other
	things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse events with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, and product sampling and
	distribution requirements in accordance with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, a part of the FDCA. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and

	Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state
	and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion and advertising, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their
	first use. In addition, a pharmaceutical company must comply with restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug&#146;s approved labeling (known as &#147;off-label use&#148;), limitations on
	industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such

	In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The
	FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in
	accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations
	from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced
	inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These
	regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the
	selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative
	conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a
	product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.

	The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United
	States. Alternatively, orphan drug designation may be available if the disease of the condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate
	reimbursement from third-party payors, including government healthcare program administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers, and other entities. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their
	conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and
	reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, our products, once approved, may not obtain market acceptance unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion

	reimbursement rate will be approved or that any required patient cost-sharing amount will be acceptable to the patient. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an
	appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor and among the insured lives of an individual payor depending upon the benefits
	applicable to the insured person. One third-party payor&#146;s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an
	adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.

	The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort.
	Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drug products and medical services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning safety
	and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow

	The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the

	status of the research and related expenditures to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for governmental or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the
	research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a

	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed

	medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a
	system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will
	allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.

	The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly
	and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility,
	item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Federal
	Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory
	safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be
	subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Federal
	Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
	was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual
	knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
	constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in
	federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just
	federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future business

	The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs
	(including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. This statute has been interpreted to prohibit presenting claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically
	unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#147;cause&#148; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing

	requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and report annually certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any &#147;transfer of value&#148; provided, as well as any ownership or investment interests
	held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th&nbsp;day of each subsequent calendar year. The information reported for the first reporting period was publicly available
	on a searchable website in September 2014. Information reported for subsequent reporting periods will also be publicly available and searchable on the CMS website. There are also an increasing number of state and foreign laws that require

	Medicaid coverage of most of the manufacturer&#146;s drugs. ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers&#146; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most
	branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for &#147;line extensions&#148; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage

	required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013
	and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to
	several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement
	from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.

	On June&nbsp;15, 2015, we submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, a new
	drug application, or an NDA, for the marketing and sale of octreotide capsules, conditionally trade-named MYCAPSSA, an oral drug proposed for the maintenance therapy of adult patients with acromegaly. On August&nbsp;14, 2015, we received notice from
	the FDA that our NDA was accepted for filing to permit a substantive review. The FDA has granted a standard review for the NDA and has set a target review date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of April&nbsp;15, 2016. The FDA also
	has conditionally accepted the proposed trade name of Mycapssa for octreotide capsules. Acceptance of the NDA filing does not represent final evaluation of the adequacy of the data submitted in the NDA and is not a guarantee of approval. The FDA may
	ultimately deny approval of the application and require additional testing or data.&nbsp;There also can be no assurance that the FDA will complete its review by the PDUFA target date. If any of the foregoing occur it could have a material adverse

	On June&nbsp;15, 2015, we submitted an NDA

	Agency, or EMA, accepted the design, enrollment criteria and required duration of Chiasma&#146;s Phase 3 trial to evaluate the non-inferiority of octreotide capsules to injectable somatostatin analogs in adult patients with acromegaly. This clinical
	trial which we initiated in March 2016 is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled study that is anticipated to include approximately 150 patients in the European Union, the United States and certain other countries. This clinical trial is
	designed to show comparative effectiveness as required by the EMA, to support MAA submission and approval. The FDA may not approve our NDA and our planned Phase 3 clinical trial may not be successful and therefore we may never receive approval to

	country and change over time. We are not permitted to market octreotide capsules in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approvals in such countries. In the
	United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of nonclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality and other factors before an NDA is
	approved. Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements and may impose pricing restrictions. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even

	the FDA will determine that the data package included in the NDA, in particular the results from our Phase 3 clinical trial, will be sufficient to warrant approval of the NDA. The FDA has advised us that interpreting efficacy from a voluntary
	long-term extension study is subject to limitations and therefore the data at the seven-month time point in our Phase 3 clinical trial will carry more weight in the efficacy evaluation than the extension data. The FDA has also informed us that, in
	its view, a single-arm study is not as informative as a controlled study such as an active control trial using a non-inferiority design, and that the interpretability of the efficacy findings we submit from our single-arm study, and whether these
	findings are robust enough to warrant approval, will be review issues as the agency evaluates our NDA. The FDA may ultimately determine that our data are insufficient for approval. The FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical trials, or

	submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application or may result in future withdrawal of approval. Regulatory approval obtained in one jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that a product candidate will
	receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions in which we may seek approval, but the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to seek approval in a different jurisdiction. Failure to obtain regulatory

	In addition, notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section&nbsp;505(b)(2), in the past some
	pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA&#146;s interpretation of Section&nbsp;505(b)(2). For example, parties have filed citizen petitions objecting to the FDA approving a Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA on both scientific and legal
	and regulatory grounds.&nbsp;Scientific arguments have included the assertions that for the FDA to determine the similarity of the drug in the 505(b)(2) NDA to the listed drug, the agency would need to reference proprietary manufacturing information
	or trade secrets in the listed drug&#146;s NDA; that it would be scientifically inappropriate for the FDA to rely on public or nonpublic information about the listed drug because it differs in various ways from the drug in the 505(b)(2) NDA; or that
	differences between the listed drug and the drug in the 505(b)(2) NDA may impair the latter&#146;s safety and effectiveness.&nbsp;Legal and regulatory arguments have included the assertion that Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDAs must contain a full report
	of investigations conducted on the drug proposed for approval, and that approving a drug through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway would lower the approval standards.&nbsp;In addition, citizen petitions have made patent-based challenges against
	505(b)(2) NDAs.&nbsp;For example, petitioners have asserted that the FDA should refuse to file a 505(b)(2) NDA unless it references a specific NDA as the listed drug, because it is &#147;most similar&#148; to the proposed drug, and provides
	appropriate patent certification to all patents listed for that NDA; or that when a 505(b)(2) NDA is pending before the agency, but before it is approved, where the FDA approves an NDA for a drug that is pharmaceutically equivalent to the drug that
	is the subject of the 505(b)(2) NDA, then the FDA should require that the 505(b)(2) NDA be resubmitted referencing the approved NDA as the listed drug and certifying to the listed patents for that approved drug. However, if the FDA or EMA changes
	its interpretation of Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) or the hybrid application pathway, or if the FDA&#146;s or EMA&#146;s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA or EMA, as applicable, from approving any
	Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDAs or hybrid application pathway MAAs that we submit. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and launch of octreotide
	capsules for the treatment of acromegaly or any future product candidates we may develop.

	competition from established drugs and major brand names and also generic versions of these products. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to our future products. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial
	success of octreotide capsules and any other product candidates we may develop are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price and reimbursement and effectiveness of our promotional
	activities. For example, physicians may choose not to prescribe octreotide capsules, if approved, because a lower percentage of patients responded to it in our Phase 3 trial compared to their previous treatments with currently available injectable

	Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our
	competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval of drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors&#146; drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold,
	than any drug we may commercialize and may render octreotide capsules or any future product candidates we may develop obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing octreotide capsules or any future

	enter the market and more advanced technologies become available. For example, a competitor could develop another oral formulation of a somatostatin analog or other technology that could make administration of peptide-based therapies more

	In the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of our drug products for &#147;off-label&#148;

	restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute our drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal
	government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government decides to intervene and prevails in the lawsuit,

	In the United States, in the event that octreotide capsules is approved, we will seek to obtain reimbursement for
	octreotide capsules from third-party payors. In recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare program. Comprehensive reforms to the U.S.
	healthcare system were enacted in 2010 with the passage of the ACA. These reforms could significantly reduce payments from Medicare and Medicaid over the next 10 years. Reforms or other changes to these payment systems, including modifications to
	the conditions on qualification for payment, bundling of payments or the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers, may change the availability, methods and rates of reimbursements from governmental payors, private insurers and other
	third-party payors for octreotide capsules and our other potential products. Some of these changes and proposed changes could result in reduced reimbursement rates for octreotide capsules and our other potential products, which would adversely
	affect our business strategy, operations and financial results.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists
	among third-party payors. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a governmental or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting
	scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting
	reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect that private insurers will consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of octreotide capsules, if approved, in determining whether to
	provide reimbursement for octreotide capsules and at what level. Obtaining these additional approvals for reimbursement can be a time-consuming and expensive process. Even if we receive regulatory approval to market octreotide capsules, our business
	would be harmed if we do not receive approval of reimbursement of octreotide capsules from third-party payors on a timely or satisfactory basis. Medicare does not cover particular drugs if it determines that they are not &#147;reasonable and
	necessary&#148; for its beneficiaries. Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare carrier level or by fiscal intermediaries. Our business could be harmed if Medicare, local Medicare carriers or fiscal intermediaries were to
	make such a determination and deny or limit the reimbursement of octreotide capsules.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our business could also be harmed if governments, private insurers,
	Medicare, Medicaid or other reimbursing bodies or payors limit the indications for which octreotide capsules will be reimbursed to a smaller set than we believe it is safe and effective in treating, or establish a limitation on the frequency with
	which octreotide capsules may be administered that is less often than we believe would be safe and effective, or establish a limitation on dose that is lower than we believe would be safe and effective.

	We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of octreotide capsules and any future product candidates we may develop due to
	healthcare reforms, as well as the trend toward programs aimed at reducing health care costs, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, additional legislative proposals, and the economic health of companies. If coverage and

	In Europe and many other foreign countries, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control, and each country has a different

	negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the
	cost-effectiveness of our product candidate, such as octreotide capsules, to other available therapies.

	We may be unable to obtain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for future product candidates we may develop. If our competitors are able to obtain

	Our octreotide capsules product candidate has been granted orphan designation in the United States and the European Union for the oral treatment of acromegaly.
	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a product
	candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as having a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals diagnosed annually in the United States, or a patient population greater
	than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the
	EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating
	condition affecting not more than five in 10,000&nbsp;persons in the European Union. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and
	chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the product candidate. Even if we request orphan drug designation for any
	future product candidates we may develop, there can be no assurances that the FDA or the European Commission will grant any of these product candidates such designation. Additionally, the designation by the FDA of any of our product candidates as an
	orphan drug does not guarantee that the FDA will accelerate regulatory review of or ultimately approve that product candidate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Generally, if a product
	candidate with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval of the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from
	approving another marketing application for the same drug and indication for that time period, except in limited circumstances. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and 10 years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be
	reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA
	determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for octreotide capsules in acromegaly and may obtain orphan drug designation for octreotide capsules in
	other indications or for future product candidates we may develop, we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and any such exclusivity that we do obtain may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be
	approved for the same condition and the same drugs can be approved for different indications and might then be used off-label in our approved indication. In the United States, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve
	another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, if one of our

	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was
	enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at
	least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to
	providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, starting in 2013, which will remain in effect until 2024 unless additional congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among
	other things, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which
	could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.

	In addition, in September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority including
	the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. The FDA&#146;s exercise of this authority could
	result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to ensure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of
	approved products. Other legislative and regulatory initiatives have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. For example, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013
	imposes new obligations on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance documents or
	interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of octreotide capsules, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent
	marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.

	Further, in some foreign
	jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 months or longer after the
	receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of octreotide capsules and any future product
	candidate we may develop to other available therapies. Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.

	Moreover, we cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further, federal and state legislative and regulatory
	developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the United States to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from octreotide capsules and any other product candidates that we
	may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.

	The Foreign Corrupt Practices
	Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act
	or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions
	requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for
	international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the DOJ. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents
	particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with
	clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.

	Various laws,
	regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain foreign nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical
	data relating to those products. Our expanding presence outside of the United States will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling octreotide
	capsules and any future product candidates we may develop outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.

	The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties, including suspension or debarment from
	government contracting. Violation of the FCPA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Indictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the U.S. government until the pending claims are resolved.
	Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of our failure to satisfy any of our obligations under laws governing
	international business practices would have a negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure government contracts. Additionally, the SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for
	violations of the FCPA&#146;s accounting provisions.

	In Europe, Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
	24&nbsp;October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, or the Directive, has required European Union member states to implement data protection laws to meet the
	strict privacy requirements of the Directive. Among other requirements, the Directive regulates transfers of personally identifiable data that is subject to the Directive, or Personal Data, to countries such as the United States, that have not been
	found to provide adequate protection to such Personal Data. We have not in the past and cannot in the future rely upon adherence to the U.S. Department of Commerce&#146;s Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss
	Safe Harbor Frameworks as agreed to and set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Union and Switzerland, which established a means for legitimating the transfer of Personal Data by data controllers in the European Economic Area,

	participate in the program. While the details regarding the Privacy Shield program continue to be finalized, we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy laws will be
	sufficient. If we are investigated by a European data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by European data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on

	relative inflation rate may exceed such rate of devaluation, or that the timing of such devaluation may lag behind the relative inflation. In any such event, the U.S. dollar cost of our operations in Israel and transactions with certain CROs would

	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve
	complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of any patents that issue, are highly uncertain. The steps we have
	taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United&nbsp;States. Further, the examination
	process may require us to narrow the claims of pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. The rights that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide
	us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our
	competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	With respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or, if any of our patent applications do
	issue, whether such patents will protect our technology and drugs, in whole or in part, or whether such patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. There is no guarantee that any of our issued
	or granted patents will not later be found invalid or unenforceable. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically
	not published until 18&nbsp;months after filing or in some cases not at all, until they are issued as a patent. Therefore we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications, that we were the
	first to file for patent protection of such inventions, or that we have found all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications that could invalidate one or more of our patents or prevent one or more of our
	patent applications from issuing. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our product candidates, third parties may initiate oppositions, interferences, re-examinations, post-grant reviews,
<I>
	inter partes
</I>
	reviews,
	nullification or derivation actions in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings challenging the validity, enforceability, or scope of such patents, which may result in the patent claims being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even
	if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates, or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could
	impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope,
	validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being
	narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and drugs, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology
	and drugs. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our

	unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. A court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from
	using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that no invalidating prior art exists. An adverse result in any
	litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, and it could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these claims, regardless
	of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least
	part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have an adverse impact on our business.

	Interference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents and patent applications or
	those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a
	license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with
	our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection
	with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions
	or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

	in any event. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO.
	Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party&#146;s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license
	from such third party to continue commercializing our product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be
	non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to effectively market product candidates based on our technology,
	which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. Alternatively, we may need to redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible
	or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing our product candidates. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found
	liable for substantial monetary damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us
	to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.

	Our success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the proprietary

	As is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual
	property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and it therefore is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, on September&nbsp;16,
	2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the AIA, was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect
	patent litigation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March&nbsp;16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a
	&#147;first-to-file&#148; system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after
	that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to
	filing of a patent application.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Among some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent
	infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March&nbsp;16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard necessary to
	invalidate a patent claim in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though
	the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if
	first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.

	Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the federal courts,

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had federal net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of $56.0 million. The federal NOL carryforwards expire at

	Under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal
	Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section&nbsp;382, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of federal NOL carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset our U.S. federal taxable income. Specifically, this
	limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in our ownership of more than 50% within any three-year period. Management has determined that we experienced an ownership change for purposes of Section&nbsp;382 on August&nbsp;16, 2005 and
	May&nbsp;12, 2008. These ownership changes resulted in annual limitations to the amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income, if any, at the federal level. The annual limit is approximately $0.1 million for 2015
	and each year thereafter. These annual limitations resulted in the loss of our ability to utilize approximately $8.9 million in federal NOL carryforwards, which resulted in a write-off of approximately $3.0 million of federal deferred tax assets
	prior to 2013. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change, as may future equity acquisitions that have equity as a component and of the purchase price. If additional
	ownership changes occur in the future, our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset income if we attain profitability may be limited. We are currently in process of evaluating whether the recent Series E Preferred Stock equity financing
	and IPO gave rise to an event of cumulative change in our ownership of more than 50%.

	We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to
	be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the
	auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from
	the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the year of our
	IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30 in any year before that time or if we have total annual
	gross revenue of $1.0&nbsp;billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31 or, if we issue more than $1.0&nbsp;billion in non-convertible
	debt during any three-year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a &#147;smaller reporting company&#148; which
	would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure
	obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less
	attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the price of our securities may be more volatile.

	Under the JOBS

	accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their
	interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.

	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting

	requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel are required to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance
	initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time consuming and costly. These rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more

	independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section&nbsp;404 will require us to continue to incur substantial
	accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of
	Section&nbsp;404 in a timely manner or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock

	Commencing with our fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over
	financial reporting in our Form&nbsp;10-K filing for that year, as required by Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This will require that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and

	July&nbsp;15, 2015 and automatically effective upon filing. Following the sale of the shares in connection with the closing of our IPO, the offering terminated. The offering did not terminate before all the securities registered in the registration
	statements were sold. Barclays Capital Inc. and Cowen and Company, LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the offering. William Blair&nbsp;&amp; Company, L.L.C. and Oppenheimer&nbsp;&amp; Co. Inc. acted as co-managers.

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of patients suffering from orphan diseases by developing and commercializing novel
	oral forms of therapies that are available today only by injection. Using our proprietary Transient Permeability Enhancer, or TPE, technology platform, we seek to develop oral therapies that eliminate the significant limitations and burdens
	generally associated with existing injectable therapies. We have completed a multinational Phase 3 clinical trial of our most advanced TPE platform-based product candidate, octreotide capsules, for the treatment of acromegaly. We believe octreotide
	capsules, if approved by regulatory authorities, will be the first somatostatin analog available for oral administration. Our octreotide capsules have been granted orphan designation in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of
	acromegaly. We submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on June&nbsp;15, 2015, seeking approval for the marketing and sale of octreotide capsules for the maintenance therapy of adult patients with
	acromegaly. On August&nbsp;14, 2015, we received notice from the FDA that our NDA was accepted for filing to permit a substantive review. The FDA has granted a standard review for the NDA and has set a target review date under the Prescription Drug
	User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of April&nbsp;15, 2016. Assuming the FDA reviews and responds to our NDA in accordance with the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, we anticipate a regulatory decision
	on marketing approval in April 2016. In light of our clinical data and feedback from patients and healthcare providers, we believe that octreotide capsules, if approved, could become a new standard of care in acromegaly.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We retain worldwide rights to develop and commercialize octreotide capsules with no royalty obligations to third parties. We intend to commercialize
	octreotide capsules ourselves in the United States, and we plan to explore collaboration opportunities for commercializing octreotide capsules in Europe and the rest of the world. Our goal is to become a leading patient-focused biopharmaceutical
	company by developing and commercializing octreotide capsules for acromegaly and other orphan indications, and leveraging our TPE platform to develop and commercialize novel oral products for other debilitating diseases currently treated by
	injectable therapies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We were incorporated in 2001 and commenced active operations in the same year. Our operations to date have been limited to
	organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our TPE technology, identifying potential drug candidates, undertaking nonclinical studies and, beginning in 2010, conducting clinical trials and preparing for
	regulatory submissions. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements, funding received from a licensing agreement, a loan agreement and our initial public offering. We have no products approved for sale and all of
	our revenue has been related to one license agreement, which has been terminated. Since our inception and through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have raised an aggregate of $366.2 million to fund our operations, of which $86.3 million was through our
	license agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., collectively Roche, $106.5 million from issuing shares of common stock in our IPO, $161.4 million was from the issuance of private securities and $12.0 million was from
	borrowings under a loan agreement. In 2013, using proceeds from the Roche license agreement, as described in more detail below, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our loan agreement and paid an aggregate of $55.0 million in cash as partial
	consideration for the redemption of certain shares of our redeemable preferred stock. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $148.8 million, of which $1.0 million was held by Chiasma
	(Israel) Ltd., our wholly owned Israeli subsidiary.

	Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $35.9 million for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, and $2.0 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $117.4 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least
	the next several years as we continue to incur substantial expenses related to preparing for and proceeding with the commercial launch of octreotide capsules, if approved, additional clinical development of octreotide capsules and the development of
	additional product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect to incur increasing operating losses over the next several years. These losses, combined with prior losses will
	continue to have an adverse effect on our cash resources, stockholders&#146; deficit and working capital. If we obtain regulatory approval of octreotide capsules and any future product candidates we may develop, we may incur significant sales,
	marketing, in-licensing and outsourced manufacturing expenses, as well as continued research and development expenses. In addition, we expect our research and development expenses to significantly increase in connection with our recently initiated
	Phase 3 clinical trial for octreotide capsules for the treatment of acromegaly to support approval in the European Union, clinical trials for octreotide capsules for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, or NET, and other indications, and as we
	develop additional product candidates for our drug pipeline. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we
	will become profitable, if at all.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If approved, we anticipate commercial sales of octreotide capsules in mid-2016 at the earliest. Until such time, if
	ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, as well as license and collaboration agreements with potential partners. We may be unable to raise
	capital when needed or on attractive terms, or to enter into collaborations agreements, which could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts. We will need to generate significant
	revenues to achieve profitability, which we may not be able to achieve.

	Roche License Agreement
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2012, we signed a license agreement with Roche, which went into effect on January 2013. Pursuant to the license agreement, we granted Roche an
	exclusive, non-transferable license to all intellectual property related to octreotide capsules. Under the terms of the license, Roche obtained worldwide rights to research, develop, make, import, export, sell, market or distribute the commercial
	product. We retained certain responsibilities for research and development activities under a joint development plan. The agreement provided for an upfront payment to us of $65.0&nbsp;million, future consideration of up to $530 million in
	development and commercial milestones and the right to receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales of octreotide capsules.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2013, we received a total of $75.0 million from Roche related to the license agreement, which included the upfront payment of $65.0 million and the first milestone payment of $10.0 million. We received an additional $10.0 million
	during January 2014 related to the second milestone payment. The two milestones were achieved during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we recognized $73.1 million in revenue with $2.9 million
	recorded as deferred revenue and customer advances. During 2013, we also received a payment of $1.0 million for reimbursement of certain research and development expenses for which the related costs had not yet been incurred and for which we
	recorded the amount as customer advances.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In March 2013, using proceeds from the Roche license agreement, our board of directors approved the redemption
	of certain of our then outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock. In consideration of this redemption, the holders of these shares received a cash payment of $55.0 million plus the issuance of newly authorized shares of preferred stock.

	In April 2014, we entered into an additional agreement with Roche pursuant to which we were to receive an
	additional aggregate amount of $2.7 million, payable in three installments, covering certain development costs incurred by us. During 2014, we received the first installment of $1.3 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In July 2014, Roche terminated the license agreement and the April 2014 agreement. Upon termination, Roche returned all rights granted under the agreements.
	Subsequent to the termination, we purchased from Roche active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, to continue the development and manufacturing of octreotide capsules, together with Roche&#146;s proposed trade name for octreotide capsules, for an

	Our revenue was derived from a license agreement with Roche, which included amounts recognized for research and development services provided and earned under
	the agreement. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until mid-2016 at the earliest, assuming our NDA for octreotide capsules in acromegaly is approved by the FDA. If we fail to complete the development of octreotide capsules or
	any future product candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate product sales, and our consolidated results of operations and financial position, would be adversely affected.

	expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, an allocation of facilities expenses, overhead expenses, nonclinical
	pharmacology and toxicology studies, manufacturing process-development and scale-up activities, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, fees paid to contract research organizations, or CROs, investigative sites, and other

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our research and development costs consist of compensation expenses for our full-time research and development employees as well as outside service and
	material related expenses. As we expand the clinical development of octreotide capsules and additional products, we expect the amount of research and development spending to continue to grow. The majority of our research and development expenses are
	being spent on the development of octreotide capsules, including manufacturing validation, regulatory and clinical activities, and our TPE platform and our early stage programs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expense research and development costs as incurred. Conducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. Product
	candidates in late stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of late-stage clinical trials. We plan to increase our
	research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to obtain regulatory approval for octreotide capsules outside the United States and to expand the indications for octreotide capsules, and to further advance our nonclinical and
	earlier stage research and development projects into clinical stages. The successful development of octreotide capsules and other product candidates we may develop is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing
	or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of octreotide

	completion of clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical
	development. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in 2016 as we purchase active pharmaceutical ingredient prior to our PDUFA date, continue to focus on our further nonclinical development on a second product

	Our deferred tax assets at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $70,000 and $40,000, respectively. Deferred tax assets were
	reported net of valuation allowances of $24.8 million and $11.3 million at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily as a result of the recording of a full valuation allowance against net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, as we
	believe it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to absorb them. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had federal NOL carryforwards of $56.0 million. The federal NOL carryforwards expire at various
	dates through 2035. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had no Israeli NOL carryforwards. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had approximately $1.0 million of federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that do not expire.

	Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate each year primarily due to a full valuation allowance maintained against U.S. deferred tax assets and

	During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, our total research and development expenses decreased by $14.9 million, or 56%,
	compared to the prior year, primarily due to the completion of our Phase 3 clinical trial of octreotide capsules in acromegaly, offset by the accrual and expense of $4.4 million for our purchase of API and other supplies related to octreotide

	termination liability we previously recorded in 2013. In March 2013, following the signing of the Roche license agreement and in anticipation of transferring our intellectual property related to
	octreotide capsules to Roche, management and the board of directors approved a one-time involuntary employee termination plan. The termination process was expected to be completed within one year. The estimated fair value of the one-time termination
	liability of $1.8 million was recorded over the required service period through the involuntary termination date for affected employees. During 2014 and 2013, we paid a total of $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of termination payments to
	departing employees. In July 2014, following Roche&#146;s decision not to submit a regulatory filing for octreotide capsules and its corresponding termination of the license agreement, we canceled the employee termination plan and reversed the
	majority of the corresponding liability previously recorded in 2013.

	candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain. Because our octreotide capsules and potential product candidates are in various stages of clinical and nonclinical development and the outcome of these
	efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of octreotide capsules and any other product candidates we may develop or whether, or when, we may achieve

	Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product sales, we expect to finance our cash needs
	through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and license and collaboration arrangements. We are not currently eligible to file a shelf registration statement; however, we believe that shelf registration statements can contribute, when
	used, to greater financing flexibility. To that end, we plan to file a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC once we are eligible to do so. To the extent that we raise additional capital through future issuance of equity or debt, the
	ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. If we raise additional funds through
	collaboration arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or drug candidates on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt
	financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market
	ourselves.

	$2.0 million in net loss, adjusted for non-cash items of $1.1 million (primarily stock-based compensation and depreciation) and was offset by working capital increases of $5.5 million primarily decreases in current liabilities. The increase in our
	cash used was driven by increased activities related to filing of an NDA for octreotide capsules in acromegaly in the United&nbsp;States, activities associated with the manufacturing process validation, increased financial consulting cost,
	compensation related expenses associated with our expanding US office as well as increased professional service fees.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial
	statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of and during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and
	material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
	judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they
	become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

	until such time that all criteria are met. For the years ending December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, our revenue was derived primarily from our now terminated license agreement with Roche. The terms of the agreement included a non-refundable upfront
	fee; contingent development, commercial, and clinical milestone payments; reimbursement of certain research and development costs; and royalty payments on sales. We did not have any revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	Revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the
	inception of a license agreement, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either our
	performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome from our performance to achieve the milestone; (b)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance; and
	(c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. In making this assessment, we evaluate factors such as the clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome
	to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required, and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement. We recognize revenues related to substantive
	milestones in full in the period in which the substantive milestone is achieved.

	Stock-based Compensation

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We issue stock-based awards to employees and nonemployees generally in the form of stock options. We account for our stock-based awards in accordance with
	Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 718,
<I>
	Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation
</I>
	, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
	options and modifications to existing stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values on the date of grant. We account for stock-based awards to nonemployees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic
	505-50,&nbsp;
<I>
	Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees
</I>
	, which requires the fair value of the nonemployee award to be remeasured as the award vests. For employee stock-based awards with only service conditions, we recognize compensation on a
	straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is usually the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. We have granted some performance based awards where the vesting of the options is accelerated upon achievement of
	certain of our operational milestones. In these cases, stock-based compensation expense is accelerated when it is considered probable that our operational milestone will be met.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
	estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and we record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the
	difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Currently, we use a 0%
	forfeiture rate.

	For modification of stock compensation awards, we record the incremental fair value of the modified awards as
	compensation on the date of modification for vested awards, or over the remaining vesting period for unvested awards. The incremental compensation is the excess of the fair value of the modified awards on the date of modification over the fair value
	of the original awards immediately before the modification. Compensation expense related to our stock-based awards is subject to a number of estimates including volatility and the underlying fair value of our common stock, as well as the estimated

	The consolidated financial

	financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is
	more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We cannot be certain that future U.S. taxable income will be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets and, accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been
	provided against our U.S. net deferred tax assets.

	recognized. The tax benefit to be recognized for any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon resolution of the contingency. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we have provided a liability of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our other expenses.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chiasma Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), convertible preferred stock and shareholders&#146;
	equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
	financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
	(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
	opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
	financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Chiasma Inc. at
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	Chiasma,&nbsp;Inc. is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company incorporated in 2001 under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is dedicated to
	improving the lives of patients suffering from orphan diseases by developing and commercializing novel oral therapies that are currently available only as injections. The Company has completed a multinational Phase 3 clinical trial of its most
	advanced Transient Permeability Enhancer platform-based product candidate, octreotide capsules, for the treatment of acromegaly and has filed a New Drug Application (&#147;NDA&#148;) with the United States Food and Drug Administration
	(&#147;FDA&#148;). In August 2015, the Company received notice that the NDA was accepted for filing to permit a substantive review and the FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#147;PDUFA&#148;) date of April&nbsp;15, 2016. The FDA also has
	conditionally accepted the proposed trade name of MYCAPSSA for octreotide capsules. Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and technical
	staff, and raising capital, and has financed its operations through our Initial Public Offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) and issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock, long-term debt, and proceeds from a license agreement. Chiasma, Inc. is
	headquartered in Massachusetts and has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Chiasma (Israel) Ltd., and Chiasma Securities Corp, collectively referred to herein as the Company. The Company&#146;s product development facilities are in Israel.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biopharmaceutical development industry. There can be no assurance that the Company&#146;s research
	and development will be successfully completed, that adequate protection for the Company&#146;s intellectual property will be obtained, that any products developed will obtain required regulatory approval or that any approved products will be
	commercially viable. Even if the Company&#146;s development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate significant product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid technological change and
	substantial competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

	be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is not able to secure adequate additional funding, the Company may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate
	assets where possible, or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm the Company&#146;s business, results of operations and future prospects.

	The preparation of financial

	the reporting period. The Company bases estimates and assumptions on historical experience when available and on various factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing the
	accompanying consolidated financial statements related to revenue recognition, the fair value of common stock and other equity instruments, accounting for stock-based compensation, present value of long-term purchase obligation, income taxes, useful
	lives of long-lived assets, and accounting for certain accruals. The Company assesses the above estimates on an ongoing basis; however, actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

	credit quality and the Company has not experienced any significant losses in these deposits. The Company regularly invests excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions and money market funds and in notes issued by the U.S.
	government, as well as in fixed income investments and U.S. bond funds, both of which can be readily purchased and sold using established markets. The Company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of these financial instruments is

	The Company accrues employment termination liabilities when (a)&nbsp;management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan of termination;
	(b)&nbsp;the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications or functions, their locations, and the expected completion date; (c)&nbsp;the plan establishes the terms of the arrangement, including the benefits that

	Revenue is recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met: (1)&nbsp;persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (2)&nbsp;delivery
	has occurred or services have been rendered, (3)&nbsp;the fee is fixed or determinable, and (4)&nbsp;collectability is reasonably assured. When one or more of the revenue recognition criteria are not met, the Company defers the recognition of
	revenue and records deferred revenue until such time that all criteria are met. For the years ending December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, the Company&#146;s revenue was derived from our now terminated license agreement (see Note 8). The terms of the
	agreement included a non-refundable upfront fee; contingent development, commercial, and clinical milestone payments; reimbursement of certain research and development costs; and royalty payments on sales.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element
	has stand-alone value to the customer. When deliverables are separable, consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable and the appropriate revenue recognition
	principles are applied to each unit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company recognizes revenue using the proportional performance method when services are rendered. Under the
	proportional performance method, revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated cost to complete.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the
	inception of the license agreement, the Company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate
	with either the Company&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome from the Company&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone; (b)&nbsp;the consideration
	relates solely to past performance; and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. In making this assessment, the Company evaluates factors such as the clinical, regulatory,
	commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required, and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the
	arrangement. The Company recognizes revenues related to substantive milestones in full in the period in which the substantive milestone is achieved.

	exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its own shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of common shares upon exercise. In addition, the common stock warrants require physical settlement and do not

	The Company accounts for
	all stock-based compensation granted to employees and nonemployees using a fair value method. Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date fair value of employee stock option grants and is recognized over the requisite service period of
	the awards, usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. Stock-based compensation awards to nonemployees are subject to revaluation over their vesting terms. For performance based awards where the vesting of
	the options may be accelerated upon the achievement of certain milestone performance, vesting and the related stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense when the achievement of the milestone is probable over the requisite service period.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For modification of stock compensation awards, the Company records the incremental fair value of the modified award as stock-based compensation on the

	The Company recognizes, as expense, the estimated fair value of all share-based payments to employees which is
	determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company has elected to recognize the compensation cost of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. In periods that the Company grants stock
	options, fair value assumptions are based on volatility, interest, dividend yield, and expected term over which the stock options will be outstanding. The computation of expected volatility is based on an average historical share price volatility
	based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of comparable publicly traded companies, which were selected based upon industry similarities. The interest rate for periods within the expected term of the award is based on the
	U.S.&nbsp;Treasury risk-free interest rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected lives of the options were estimated using the simplified method. Computation of expected forfeitures is based on historical data to estimate pre-vesting option
	forfeitures of our stock options. Currently, we use an estimated forfeiture rate of 0%.

	For options granted to non-employees, the expected life of the
	option used is the contractual term of each such option. All other assumptions used to calculate the grant date fair value are generally consistent with the assumptions used for options granted to employees. Stock-based compensation expense for
	awards granted to non-employees is adjusted as the award vests to reflect the current fair value of such awards, and is recognized using an accelerated attribution model.

	4. Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
	principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be
	classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 1&#151;Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
	liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 2&#151;Inputs other than quoted prices in active
	markets that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 3&#151;Inputs that are unobservable for the
	asset or liability.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination
	of fair value requires more judgment.&nbsp;Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level&nbsp;3.&nbsp;A financial instrument&#146;s level within the fair value
	hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The fair value measurements of the Company&#146;s
	financial instruments at December&nbsp;31, 2015 are summarized in the table below:

	In March 2013, following the signing of the Roche (as defined below) license agreement, discussed in detail in Note&nbsp;8
	below, and in anticipation of transferring the Company&#146;s intellectual property related to octreotide capsules to Roche, management and the board of directors approved a special severance arrangement for certain employees of Chiasma (Israel)
	Ltd. who were identified for termination. These employees were entitled to a one-time payment upon their involuntary termination by the Company. No payment would be made for voluntary terminations or in the event the Company canceled the employee
	termination plan. Because the affected employees were required to continue providing services through the termination date in order to receive payment, the Company recorded the fair value of the termination payments over the period from the date the
	plans were approved and communicated to the affected employees through the expected termination date. The employee termination process was expected to be completed within one year.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company estimated the aggregate one-time termination benefit to be $1.9 million, which approximated the fair value of the liability on the day the
	termination plan was approved and communicated to affected employees. During 2014 and 2013, the Company paid a total of $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of special severance arrangements to departing employees. As of December&nbsp;31,
	2013, $1.2 million was recorded as termination liability. In July 2014 following Roche&#146;s decision to terminate the license agreement, the Company canceled the employee termination plan. Accordingly, with the exception of one employee,
	liabilities previously recorded under the involuntary termination plan were reversed.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	December 2012, the Company signed a license agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (collectively &#147;Roche&#148;), which was effective in January 2013, and granted Roche an exclusive, non-transferable license to the
	Company&#146;s intellectual property related to the octreotide capsules. Under the terms of the agreement, Roche obtained worldwide rights to research, develop, make, import, export, sell, market or distribute the commercial product. The Company
	retained certain research and development activities under a joint development plan. The Company retained all rights to the intellectual property contained in the agreement. The agreement provided for an upfront payment of $65.0 million, future
	consideration of up to $530.0 million in development and commercial milestones, and the right to receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales of octreotide capsules.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s total service obligations of $85.0 million were recognized over the expected service period using the proportional performance method of
	revenue recognition. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company received a total of $75.0 million from Roche related to the license agreement, and an additional $10.0 million was received during January 2014. The Company evaluated the
	transaction and concluded that the license right did not have stand-alone value. As a result, the arrangement primarily represented a research and development arrangement provided by the Company and all elements of the arrangement were considered
	one unit of accounting. In 2013, the Company recognized $73.1 million as revenue for services provided during the year using the proportional performance method based on costs included in research and development expenses. Deferred revenue and
	customer advances at December&nbsp;31, 2013 totaled $2.9 million which included $1.0 million received from Roche for expected reimbursable costs that had not yet been incurred by the Company.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April 2014, the Company and Roche entered into a joint development plan. Under the plan, the Company was to receive an aggregate amount of $2.7 million
	covering certain costs incurred by the Company to be payable in three installments. During 2014, the Company received the first installment of $1.3 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In July 2014, Roche terminated the license agreement. Upon termination, Roche returned all rights and documentation granted under the agreement to the
	Company. The Company was relieved of further obligations under the agreement and recognized the remaining revenue of $13.2 million as revenues. Subsequent to the termination, the Company purchased from Roche active pharmaceutical ingredient
	(&#147;API&#148;) supplies to continue the development and manufacturing of octreotide capsules as well as Roche&#146;s proposed trade name for octreotide capsules for an aggregate amount of $5.1 million payable in three equal annual installments of
	$1.7 million beginning in 2016. The Company made the first $1.7 million payment in March 2016. The difference between the aggregate purchase price and the present value of the installment payments represents the interest component of the financing
	arrangement and is being recorded as interest expense over the payment term. Other than these payments, the Company has no other financial and operational obligations to Roche. Following the termination

	The Company had a secured loan agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation to borrow up to $12.0 million. Amounts borrowed under the loan bore interest
	at 10.85%&nbsp;per annum and matured in 42 months. In February 2013, the Company paid the outstanding principal, accrued interest, and prepayment fees totaling $11.1 million. Following the repayment, the secured loan agreement was terminated and the

	In connection with the loan, the Company issued to the lender warrants to purchase 480,000
	shares of Series C preferred at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The warrants were accounted for as a liability and carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. In March 2013, the
	lender exercised the warrants on a cashless basis into 190,841 shares of Series C preferred calculated using the fair value of Series C preferred on the exercise date. The fair value of the warrants at the time of exercise was recorded as Series C

	11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the years ended December 2012 and 2013, the Company issued an aggregate of 38,504,439&nbsp;shares of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock
	(the &#147;Series D preferred&#148;) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,698,066 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $ 0.09&nbsp;per share (the &#147;Warrants&#148;), for aggregate gross proceeds of $38.5 million, of which
	$34.8 million was allocated to the Series D preferred and $3.6 million was allocated to the Warrants, net of issuance cost in the amount of $0.1 million. Since the Series&nbsp;D preferred was issued in conjunction with freestanding detachable
	warrants, the proceeds from the issuance were allocated to each freestanding instrument based on their relative fair value.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company accreted the
	discount amount due to the Warrants allocation and issuance cost, using the interest method, until August 2014 which was the earliest redemption date of the instrument according to the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation then in effect.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In March 2013, the Company redeemed its Series B1 redeemable convertible preferred stock (&#147;Series B1 preferred&#148;), Series C preferred, and Series D
	preferred (&#147;collectively, the &#147;Original Preferred Stock&#148;) using proceeds received from the license agreement with Roche (see Note 8), which redemption was effected in accordance with the deemed liquidation provisions of the
	Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation then in effect. Pursuant to such deemed liquidation provisions, upon such an event the Series D preferred was entitled to a redemption amount equal to its original issuance price plus $38.5 million.
	Accordingly, the Company immediately recognized the change in the redemption value in the amount of $38.5 million against accumulated deficit. The consideration for the redemption consisted of a cash payment of $55.0 million and the issuance of
	1,134,997 shares of Series B1&#146; redeemable convertible preferred stock (&#147;Series B1&#146; preferred&#148;), 40,430,250 shares of Series C&#146; redeemable convertible preferred stock (&#147;Series C&#146; preferred&#148;), and 38,504,439
	shares of Series D&#146; redeemable convertible preferred stock (&#147;Series D&#146; preferred&#148;, and collectively with the Series B1&#146; preferred and Series C&#146; preferred, the &#147;Prime Preferred Stock&#148;). The Prime Preferred
	Stock bears similar terms, rights and preferences as the Original Preferred Stock, other than changes to reflect redemption payment of Series D preferred described above. In addition, the holders of the Original Preferred Stock received rights to
	receive future contingent payments under the Roche license agreement. Upon termination of the license agreement, these rights were also terminated.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	initial carrying value of the Prime Preferred Stock equaled the carrying value of the Original Preferred Stock on the redemption date. The Company accreted the carrying value of the Series&nbsp;D&#146; preferred to its redemption value until August
	2014, which was the earliest redemption date of the Series&nbsp;D&#146; preferred according to the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	December 2014, the Company issued 33,774,763 shares of Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock (&#147;Series E preferred&#148;) at $1.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $33.8 million, with issuance costs of $0.2&nbsp;million. In
	connection with the issuance of Series E preferred, the Company issued to the holders warrants to purchase 924,622 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock with an exercise price of $9.13 per share and allocated $0.8 million of the net proceeds to
	the warrants based on their relative fair value on the issuance date which was accounted for as a discount on Series&nbsp;E preferred and recorded as additional paid-in capital.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2015, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock (&#147;Series E preferred&#148;) to
	a total of 80,774,458 shares and subsequently sold and issued an aggregate of 35,948,023 shares of Series E preferred at $1.00 per share for gross proceeds of $35.9 million, with of issuance costs of $0.3 million. In connection with the issuance of
	Series E preferred, the Company issued to the holders of Series E preferred warrants to purchase 984,116 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, with an exercise price of $9.13 per share and allocated $1.5 million of the net proceeds to the
	warrants based on their relative fair value on the issuance date which was accounted for as a discount on Series E preferred and recorded as additional paid in capital.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the closing of the IPO on July&nbsp;21, 2015, all of the Company&#146;s outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically

	On June&nbsp;30, 2015, the board of directors approved a 1-for-9.132 reverse stock split. As a result, all common stock, warrants and options for common stock,

	In 2008, the Company&#146;s
	board of directors adopted the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;2008 Plan&#148;), which provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, and restricted stock to employees, directors, and nonemployees of the Company

	In July 2015 we approved a 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan), which became effective upon the initial public offering. The 2015 Plan&#146;s
	aggregate pool of available shares is 2,605,792 of common stock. The plan allows for granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, and restricted stock to employees, directors, and nonemployees of the Company. In connection with
	the adoption of the 2015 Plan, no further option grants are permitted under the 2008 Plan and any expirations, cancellations, or terminations under the previous plans are available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the

	During 2013, the Company&#146;s board of directors modified the terms of the then outstanding stock options by
	(a)&nbsp;extending exercisability of the options to the second anniversary upon termination of employment or services, and (b)&nbsp;accelerating the vesting of stock options upon Roche filing for regulatory approval under the license agreement. In
	addition, during 2014, the board of directors modified the exercise price of certain stock options granted to employees and executives. The incremental compensation expense, resulting from comparing the fair value of stock options immediately before
	and immediately after the modifications, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 totaled $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. In 2014, $0.3 million of the incremental compensation expenses was classified as research and
	development expense and $0.1 million was classified as marketing, general and administrative expense. In 2013, $40,000 of the incremental compensation expenses was classified as research and development expense and $0.1 million was classified as
	marketing, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

	For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, two
	directors exercised options to purchase an aggregate of 122,644 shares of common stock of which 116,258 of the shares were issued as restricted stock as they were exercised prior to full vesting. The proceeds from the issuance of the restricted
	stock are presented as long-term liabilities within the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, since the Company has the right to acquire back the unvested portion of the restricted stock following termination of the services of their holder. The
	long term liability is released to additional paid-in capital per the original vesting schedule of the options. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the outstanding balance of the liability was $0.3 million and the outstanding restricted shares were
	97,093. The weighted fair value of the options at original grant date was $2.62.

	When realization of a deferred tax asset is more likely than not to occur, the benefit related to the deductible
	temporary differences attributable to operations is recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when, based on all available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some
	portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. The Company cannot be certain that future U.S. taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance
	has been provided against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased $13.5 million in 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in NOL carryforwards. The Company continues to monitor the need for a valuation allowance based
	on the profitability of its future operations.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had federal NOL carryforwards totaling approximately $56.0 million
	that expire at various dates through 2035. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had no Israeli NOL carryforwards. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had approximately $1.0 million of federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that do
	not expire.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in the Company&#146;s ownership may limit the
	amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset its U.S. federal taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 50% within any
	three-year period. Management has determined that the Company experienced an ownership change for purposes of Section&nbsp;382 in August 2005 and May 2008. These ownership changes resulted in annual limitations to the amount of NOL carryforwards
	that can be utilized to offset future taxable income, if any, at the federal level. The annual limit is approximately $0.1 million for 2015, and each year thereafter. These annual limitations resulted in the loss of the Company&#146;s ability to
	utilize approximately $8.9 million in federal NOL carryforwards, which resulted in a write-off of approximately $3.0 million of federal deferred tax assets prior to 2013.
