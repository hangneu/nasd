	The process of developing product candidates for ddRNAi-based therapeutics contains a number of inherent risks and uncertainties. For example,
	it may not be possible to identify a target region of a disease-associated gene that has not been previously identified and/or patented by others, resulting in restrictions on freedom to operate for that target sequence. Silencing the target gene
	may not ultimately result in curing the disease as there may be more factors contributing to the development of the disease than the target gene. Silencing the target gene using ddRNAi may lead to short-term or long-term adverse effects that were
	not predicted or observed in preclinical studies. The delivery of the DNA construct to the target cells may not be possible, or complete or adequate to provide sufficient therapeutic benefit.

	other countries. We and our current collaborators, or any future collaborators, may never receive approval to market and commercialize any product candidate. Even if we or a collaborator obtain regulatory approval, the approval may be for disease

	Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. For
	example, the FDA has established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (formerly Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies) within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and
	related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the United States National
	Institutes of Health, or the NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities&#146; Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or the RAC. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC
	review process can delay the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial design and details and approved its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can put a proposed biological product on clinical hold even if the RAC has
	provided a favorable review of the product. Also, before a clinical trial can begin at any institution, that institution&#146;s institutional review board, or IRB, and its institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, if it has one, have to review the
	proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory bodies to change the requirements for
	approval of any of our product candidates.

	These committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate and new
	requirements they may impose may lengthen the clinical development and regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent

	Successful clinical development
	of ddRNAi-based therapeutics is largely dependent on using the appropriate vectors to obtain therapeutically relevant concentrations of the DNA constructs that express the shRNAs in the appropriate target cells. To develop effective product
	candidates, we will need to license delivery technologies from third parties or develop delivery technologies with research collaborators. Although delivery technologies, including AAV vectors, have been identified and are well defined for specific
	tissue types, we continue to seek vectors with ideal delivery properties for other indications we are pursuing, including OPMD. The tissue tropism and other physical properties of AAV vectors are limited and may not be effective for other product
	candidates or delivery into a wide array of tissues types. AAV vectors can also trigger immune responses in some patients, and those patients will not derive clinical benefit from administration of a product candidate unless steps are taken to
	clinically address the issue. If we or our collaborators are not successful in identifying effective vectors for our product candidates, we may not succeed in developing marketable products. In addition, if we are unable to reach agreement on
	favorable terms, or at all, with providers of any effective vectors that we do identify, we may not succeed in completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. We have only one such agreement
	in place that allows us to use a vector both for clinical trials and for commercialization, and that agreement is with respect to our program for the treatment of AMD.

	Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in any future clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The
	timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates. Patients may be unwilling to participate in any future clinical trials because of negative publicity from adverse
	events in the biotechnology, RNAi or gene therapy industries. Patients may be unavailable for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, and the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting trials and
	obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct any future clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or discontinue those clinical trials.

	For example, we
	experienced some difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trial of TT-034, which was discontinued for commercial reasons. These difficulties were due to several factors, including sudden changes in patients&#146; viral load, liver enzymes
	and other clinical parameters immediately prior to their dosing, as well as late withdrawal due to personal reasons. We believe the increased availability of new and effective therapies such as Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were recently approved for
	treatment of the hepatitis C virus, and the fact that the early lower-dose cohort patients receive a sub-therapeutic dose of TT-034, may also have been contributing factors. We may face similar difficulties enrolling patients in clinical trials for
	other product candidates for these and other reasons.

	Approval of a product

	authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Sales of our product candidates outside of the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval. Even if the FDA grants marketing
	approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing and marketing of the product candidates in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve
	requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be
	approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products, if approved, is also subject to approval. Even if a product candidate is approved, the FDA or
	comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or
	reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States also have requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining foreign
	regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in certain countries.

	approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn based on adverse events reported or regulatory decisions made in other countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or fail to receive
	applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be compromised and our business may be adversely affected.

	Of our current product candidates, the only one designed for treatment of an indication that would likely
	qualify for rare disease status is our ddRNAi therapeutic for the treatment of OPMD. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs or biological products for relatively small
	patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than
	200,000 individuals annually in the United States. The FDA may also designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a disease or condition of more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation
	that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product candidate. Under the European Union orphan drug legislation, a rare
	disease or condition means a disease or condition which affects not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union at the time of the orphan drug designation application.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has
	such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for such indication for that time period. During the marketing exclusivity period,
	in the European Union, the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, is precluded from approving a similar drug with an identical therapeutic indication. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. The
	European Union exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may
	be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because
	different drugs can be approved for the same condition, and the same drug could be approved for a different condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug, made by a competitor, for the same
	condition if the FDA concludes that the competitive product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In the European Union, the EMA can approve a competitive product if the
	orphan drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation (including sufficient profitability), if the competitive product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior, or if the orphan drug cannot be supplied in sufficient
	quantities.

	intellectual property rights, or argue that our intellectual property does not cover, or add value to, any product candidates they develop. If a dispute arises, it may result in costly patent office procedures and litigation, and our collaborator

	The availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford
	expensive treatments. Sales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both in the United States and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and
	similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is
	provided, the reimbursement amounts approved by third-party payors may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a return on our investment.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, the
	principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a
	new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as
	there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The intended use of a pharmaceutical product by a
	physician can also affect pricing. For example, CMS could initiate a National Coverage Determination administrative procedure, by which the agency determines which uses of a therapeutic product would and would not be reimbursable under Medicare.
	This determination process can be lengthy, thereby creating a long period during which the future reimbursement for a particular product may be uncertain.

	Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive
	governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries is likely to put pressure on the pricing and usage of any of our product
	candidates that may be approved for marketing in the future. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems
	can be substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. In some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical
	trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing
	regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient
	to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.

	Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and other third-party payors, in
	the United States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs, resulting in legislation and reforms such as, in the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act,
	or the ACA. The ACA may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. In addition, other legislative
	changes have been adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 2013 that, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will
	stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several
	providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could
	negatively affect coverage or reduce the reimbursement for any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval.

	We expect to

	pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription pharmaceutical products and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.
	We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on pharmaceutical
	product pricing. Such reforms could depress pricing for any product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may negatively affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop

	The patent application process, also known as patent prosecution, is expensive and time-consuming, and we and our current or future licensors

	cover our product candidates, third parties may initiate opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings challenging the
	validity, enforceability or scope of such patents, which may result in the patent claims being narrowed or invalidated. For example, three of our European patents licensed from CSIRO that expire in 2019 have been subject to oppositions before the
	European Patent Office (EPO), and these oppositions have resulted in appealable decisions to maintain one of the European patents and to revoke two others. Each of those EPO decisions has been appealed. One of the appeals filed by CSIRO has been
	dismissed and the relevant European patent was revoked. The remaining two appeals are still underway and we cannot know whether these appeals, if carried through, will be decided favorably for us. Furthermore, even if our patents and patent
	applications are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent
	competition from third parties.

	If the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our programs or product candidates
	fail to issue, or are revoked, if the breadth or strength of our patent protection is threatened, or if our patent portfolio fails to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us
	to develop product candidates and threaten our ability to commercialize future products. Any successful opposition to any patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product
	candidates that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and
	most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to a product candidate. Furthermore, if
	third parties have filed such patent applications before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by such third parties to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent
	claims of our applications. If third parties have filed such applications on or after March 16, 2013, a derivation proceeding in the United States can be initiated by such third parties to determine whether our invention was derived from theirs.
	Even where we have a valid and enforceable patent, we may not be able to exclude others from practicing our invention where the other party can show that they used the invention in commerce before our filing date or the other party benefits from a
	compulsory license. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it
	affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, including biosimilar or generic medications. This risk is
	material in light of the length of the development process of our products and lifespan of our current patent portfolio.

	In addition to
	the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any
	other elements of our product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. What constitutes a trade
	secret and what protections are available for trade secrets varies from state to state in the United States and country by country worldwide. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality
	agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic
	security of our information technology systems. Security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
	Although we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into
	confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain
	access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets can be difficult to detect, could impair our competitive position and may have

	For example, in patent litigation in the United
	States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or
	non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome
	following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent
	examiner were unaware during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and
	equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, such as opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation, amendments to our patent claims or statements being made on the record such that our claims may no longer be construed to
	cover our product candidates. For example, three of our European patents licensed from CSIRO have been subject to oppositions before the European Patent Office (EPO), and these oppositions have resulted in appealable decisions to maintain one
	European patent and to revoke two others. Each of those EPO decisions has been appealed. One of the appeals filed by CSIRO has been dismissed and the relevant European patent was revoked. The remaining two appeals are still underway. Outcomes or
	statements on the record in one country could have a disadvantageous effect on prosecution or enforcement of a patent or patent application in another country. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is
	unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that no invalidating prior art exists or that the patent examiner was aware of all material prior art during prosecution. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do
	not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain, enforce or defend the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be

	technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and
	could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, enforcement of a favorable decision by a court can depend on cooperation of a governmental authority which may or may not be available in every

	For our patents and patent applications filed in the United States before March 16, 2013, interference proceedings provoked by third parties

	As is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly
	patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and it therefore is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America
	Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent
	litigation.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An important change introduced by the Leahy-Smith Act is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a
	&#147;first-to-file&#148; system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after
	that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to
	filing of a patent application. It is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the
	prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.

	Among some of the other changes introduced
	by the Leahy-Smith Act are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued
	before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO

	We are a biotechnology company developing a novel, proprietary therapeutic technology platform that combines gene silencing and gene therapy
	with a goal of providing sustained, long-lasting silencing of disease-causing genes from a single administration. We believe our technology has the potential to be a &#147;one shot&#148; cure for a wide range of diseases that are currently addressed
	by strict ongoing treatment regimens or that have no effective treatment or only palliative care options. We are using our technology, called DNA-directed RNA interference, or ddRNAi, to develop our pipeline of product candidates for the treatment
	of several chronic and life-threatening human diseases, such as hepatitis B, age-related macular degeneration, or AMD and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, or OPMD. We will require additional financing to conduct clinical trials for our product
	candidates for hepatitis B, AMD and OPMD. These diseases have large patient populations, with the exception of OPMD which is a rare disease. In addition, we have licensed our ddRNAi technology to other biopharmaceutical companies whose pipeline
	programs are progressing towards, or are in, clinical development for applications including HIV/AIDS, retinitis pigmentosa, Huntington&#146;s disease, cancer immunotherapy and intractable neuropathic pain.

	Many diseases are known to be caused by the inappropriate expression of a gene or multiple genes. It has been observed since 1998 that RNA
	interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism that can potentially be used to specifically turn off, or silence, genes whose sequences are known. Thus, RNAi can potentially be used to treat or cure diseases with a genetic basis by targeting a specific
	region of the molecular sequence of the disease-causing gene. RNAi is potentially applicable to over 20,000 human genes and a large number of disease-causing microorganism-specific genes. The mechanism of action of RNAi involves the introduction of
	short interfering RNA, or siRNA, into a cell. The siRNA&#146;s sequence is constructed to match a short region of the target gene. The

	Our ddRNAi technology is designed to utilize the specificity and gene silencing effect of RNA interference while overcoming many of the
	limitations associated with the ongoing administration of siRNA. Our ddRNAi approach combines RNA interference with gene therapy. Unlike siRNA, our ddRNAi technology starts with a DNA construct. Gene therapy vectors, which are carrier molecules,
	often viruses, that deliver genetic material into the cell, are used to deliver the DNA construct to the nucleus of the targeted cells. The DNA construct then generates double-stranded short hairpin RNAs, or shRNAs, which are processed by the cell
	into siRNAs, which in turn silence the disease-associated genes. Advantages of our ddRNAi approach include:

	We are developing BB-103 and BB-101 (previously known as Hepbarna), which are currently in preclinical studies, for the treatment of the
	hepatitis B virus, or HBV. We plan to file an investigational new drug, or IND, application late in 2017 for either BB-103 or BB-101. HBV is a small DNA virus that, according to the WHO, infects up to 240 million people worldwide, resulting in up to
	780,000 deaths per year. Infection with HBV occurs in phases ranging from a silent, acute phase that can be resolved by the immune system to a persistent chronic infection requiring life-long therapy. In the case of a chronic HBV infection, the
	presence of viral particles and proteins, particularly the s-antigen, causes hepatic inflammation leading to liver dysfunction, acute hepatic failure, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients suffering from HBV have limited treatment options
	from therapies consisting of antivirals and, less commonly, interferon therapy. These treatments require adherence to strict recurrent treatment regimens, may cause the hepatitis B virus to mutate and develop antiviral drug resistance, and may only
	provide viral suppression through the course of administration, and not a cure. The long-term use of interferon, particularly in high doses, may also be associated with significant side effects, including nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath,
	dizziness and fatigue, that can cause patients to deviate from the course of treatment. BB-103 and BB-101 are both designed to be single administration ddRNAi-based therapies that are delivered using a gene therapy vector that targets the liver and
	inhibits viral replication and s-antigen production on a long-term basis. Both BB-103 and BB-101 could be used either as monotherapies or, more likely, in combination with another antiviral compound.

	Many diseases are known to be caused by the inappropriate expression of a gene or multiple genes. These
	disease-associated genes can be turned off, or silenced, by the use of RNAi, resulting in a treatment or cure of the disease. Thus, RNAi provides the ability to develop therapeutics against diseases caused by inappropriate gene expression, by
	targeting a specific region of the molecular sequence of the disease-causing gene. RNAi is potentially applicable to over 20,000 human genes and a large number of disease-causing microorganism-specific genes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The mechanism of action of RNAi involves the introduction of siRNA into a cell. The siRNA&#146;s sequence is constructed to match a short
	region of the target gene. The siRNA is processed by the cell&#146;s own enzymes to destroy the target gene&#146;s mRNA, thus preventing the disease-causing gene from being expressed. This occurs as long as the siRNA remains prevalent in the cell.
	In the standard RNAi approach, siRNA is produced synthetically in the laboratory and introduced into the target cell either by chemical modification of the RNA or by a range of delivery materials. A number of other companies, including Alnylam,
	Arbutus, and Dicerna, utilize this approach in their RNAi product candidates.

	We have completed a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for our now
	discontinued product candidate, TT-034, which we were developing to treat patients chronically infected with the most common genotype of HCV. The trial achieved its primary end point of safety of TT-034 in HCV patients, based on safety within the
	liver and other organs of the nine patients that were dosed in the study. There was one serious adverse event observed, a pulmonary embolism resulting from a fall, and it was classified as unrelated to the therapy. That event was resolved within
	four weeks. Three other adverse events (diarrhoea, light-headedness and bradycardia) were also observed and considered possibly treatment related. All of those events were mild in nature and resolved completely. No adverse event met the pre-defined
	criteria for a dose-limiting toxicity. In addition, no T-cell capsid response was seen in any of the subjects, as has been previously reported at similar high-dose levels in other companies&#146; systemic trials with AAV. While transduction of
	hepatic tissues was seen, there was no reduction in viral load in treated patients, which was a secondary endpoint of the study. We believe that our experience with the TT-034 clinical trial will be of value in designing and implementing our other
	programs, in particular HBV, as both HBV and HCV replicate in the liver. We have designed certain aspects of BB-103 to mimic the design elements of TT-034.

	A problem inherent to all of the current HBV antiviral treatment approaches is their inability to achieve a curative outcome. According to a
	study published in the
<I>
	Journal of Viral Hepatitis
</I>
	in 2014, HBsAg clearance occurs in only 3% of patients treated with NUCs and 7.8% of patients treated with interferon
<I>
	.
</I>
	Sustained suppression of HBV cccDNA by treatment with NUCs is only
	possible with continued treatment for many years, and clear-cut guidelines on when to stop treatment are not yet available. The authors concluded that there is a need for alternative therapeutic approaches such as drugs that can preferentially
	target stages in the life cycle of HBV, referred to as direct acting anti-virals, or DAAs, as well as new immunotherapeutic approaches. We believe that our ddRNAi-based therapeutic for HBV has characteristics of both of these approaches.

	We are developing BB-103 to address many of the limitations of therapeutics for HBV currently on the

	inhibit both viral replication and viral protein, including s-antigen, production on a long-term basis. BB-103 could be used either as a monotherapy or, more likely, in combination with another antiviral compound.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have designed certain components of BB-103 to mimic our now discontinued product candidate for HCV, TT-034, as both HBV and HCV replicate

	will target the liver and express three shRNAs that target three separate conserved regions of the genome. The most significant change is the replacement of the three anti-HCV shRNAs of TT-034 with three anti-HBV shRNAs in BB-103 as well as modeling
	the anti-HBV shRNAs into a miRNA backbone for more efficient expression. Though we have discontinued our clinical trial for TT-034 for commercial reasons, we believe the clinical results of TT-034 provide support for the safety of our platform

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The design of the BB-103 DNA construct takes advantage of the structure of the HBV genome. The hepatitis B virus is a small DNA virus with four
	overlapping open reading frames, meaning several genes are produced from the same DNA sequence by shifting the starting point of the translation process
<I>
	(Figure 3)
</I>
	. These four genes are known as the core, surface, X and polymerase genes. The
	core gene encodes the core nucleocapsid protein, which is important in viral packaging and thought to help stabilize cccDNA, and hepatitis B e-antigen. The surface gene encodes proteins, including s-antigen. The X gene encodes the X protein, which
	has properties that may be important in liver carcinogenesis. The polymerase gene encodes a large protein with functions critical for viral packaging and replication. Although HBV is a DNA virus, it replicates through an RNA intermediate. BB-103
	targets the viral mRNA at three overlapping regions of the genome
<I>
	(Figure 3)
</I>
	, simultaneously silencing the surface, X, core and polymerase genes. As a result, we believe that the long-term suppression of HBV viral replication, through
	silencing of the polymerase gene and targeting the HBV RNA used for replication, the inhibition of HBV viral proteins production, including the s-antigen production, through silencing of the surface gene, and the inhibition of the cccDNA, through
	silencing of the core protein gene, could lead to eradication of HBV infection in patients by a single administration of BB-103.

	AMD is the deterioration of
	the eye&#146;s macula. The macula is a small area in the retina that is responsible for central vision. AMD is the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in older adults, often involving blood vessel overgrowth and damage to the retina
	resulting in the loss of vision in the central visual field. The vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF-A, is responsible for stimulating the new blood vessel growth. The disease occurs in two forms, wet and dry. Dry AMD is the most common type
	of macular degeneration and affects 85% to 90% of the people with AMD. Dry AMD often develops into wet AMD.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the dry form, there is a
	breakdown of retinal pigment epithelial cells in the macula. These cells support the light-sensitive photoreceptor cells that are critical for vision. Generally, the damage caused by the dry form is not as severe or rapid as that of the wet form.
	However, over time, it can cause profound vision loss. There are currently no approved treatments for dry AMD.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Wet AMD is the more
	advanced type of AMD. In wet AMD, which is also called exudative, or neovascular, AMD, the Bruch&#146;s membrane underlying the retina thickens, then breaks. The oxygen supply to the macula is disrupted and, as a result, new abnormal blood vessels
	grow through the subretinal membrane towards the macula, often raising the retina. The blood vessels are fragile, and often leak fluids that damage the macula. VEGF-a is a key molecule known to stimulate the new blood vessel growth in wet AMD.
	Although the wet form of the disease affects only 10% to 15% of those who have AMD, wet AMD accounts for 90% of the severe vision loss caused by macular degeneration.

	developed include genes that express VEGF inhibitors in addition to other factors that activate new blood vessel formation. In contrast, our approach is designed to directly silence the gene responsible for producing VEGF-a. We believe this could be
	more effective than other gene therapy approaches as our approach is to design ddRNAi-based therapeutics to prevent the production of VEGF-a rather than to deliver a new gene that expresses a new protein to inhibit VEGF-a after it has been produced.
	Furthermore, we believe that most of the other gene therapy approaches are delivered using subretinal injections. This route of administration presents challenges, including the requirement for hospitalization as a result of general anesthesia and
	the length of time required to complete the complicated surgical procedure.

	TT-034 for the Treatment of Hepatitis C
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Hepatitis C is a complex public health problem, characterized by a high prevalence of chronic infection by an RNA virus, an increasing burden
	of HCV-associated disease, low rates of testing and treatment, and the prospect of increasing incidence associated with injectable drug abuse. According to the WHO, over 170 million individuals worldwide have chronic hepatitis C. Chronic infection
	can result in cirrhosis and death in 20% of patients due to end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma. We had been developing a ddRNAi-based therapeutic, TT-034, for the treatment of the most common genotype of the human hepatitis C virus.
	We began a Phase I/IIa first-in-human clinical trial of TT-034 in January 2014. Following the commencement of the clinical trial of TT-034, a number of new and effective therapeutics were approved for the treatment of HCV.&nbsp;Subsequently,
	competitors&#146; products showed improvements in the efficacy, delivery and success rate of treatments for HCV while, at the same time, reducing the price and duration of their treatments.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of the increasingly competitive landscape, in February 2016 we concluded that the TT-034 program no longer offered the commercial value necessary
	to attract a worthwhile commercial partnership deal and, as a result, did not warrant additional expenditure or focus of our resources beyond completion of the existing patients.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The phase I/IIa clinical trial of TT-034 enrolled nine patients who received a single intravenous infusion of TT-034 at escalating doses of 4 x 10

	vg/kg. Patients were monitored for safety and efficacy assessments over 24 weeks following the administration of TT-034. A liver biopsy, collected 21 days post dosing, was used to assess hepatic
	TT-034 DNA levels and shRNA expression.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These results show the administered doses of TT-034 to be well tolerated with no treatment related serious adverse
	events observed. In the nine patients dosed, one serious adverse event, a pulmonary embolism resulting from a fall, was observed and classified as unrelated to the therapy. That event was resolved within four weeks. Three other adverse events
	(diarrhoea, light-headedness and bradycardia) were also observed and considered possibly treatment related. All of those events were mild in nature and resolved completely. No adverse event met the pre-defined criteria for a dose-limiting toxicity.
	In addition, no T-cell capsid response was seen in any of the subjects, as has been previously reported at similar high dose levels in other companies&#146; systemic trials with AAV. The patients dosed with TT-034 will be followed in a pre-planned
	follow-up study where they will have annual health checks for four and one-half years following completion of the study.

	Efficient delivery of DNA constructs to tissues remains a principal challenge to the development of gene therapy based therapeutics. Most gene

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A proportion of patients possess neutralizing antibodies to AAV, and efficient liver

	strategies such as transient immune suppression might circumvent these issues, we believe the use of non-viral DNA delivery vectors, designed to be non-immunogenic, could offer intrinsic advantages for gene therapy. We are consequently investigating

	In addition to patent protection of ddRNAi technology and our product candidates, we also rely on proprietary know-how that is not patentable
	or that we elect not to patent, as valuable intellectual property for our business. This know-how is related to the areas of, among others, identifying nucleic acid targets for ddRNAi technology and designing ddRNAi constructs for targeting
	preferred genes. We have implemented a number of security measures to safeguard our know-how including limiting access to our research facilities, databases and networks. We also protect know-how by way of confidentiality agreements when engaging

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal terms of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most
	countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a
	result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee. A patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. The patent term of a European
	patent is 20 years from its filing date, which, unlike in the United States, is not subject to patent term adjustments.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The term of a
	patent that covers an FDA-approved biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and
	Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the biologic is under
	clinical testing regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved biologic may be extended. Similar provisions
	are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved biologic although the eligibility requirements for any duration of such extension vary. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA
	approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products.

	For example, improvements in the efficacy, delivery and success rates of competitors&#146; product candidates, in conjunction with a reduction in the price and duration of their treatments, diminished partnering interest from pharmaceutical
	companies in our product candidate TT-034 for the treatment of HCV. This caused us to announce in February 2016 the discontinuation of our program to develop TT-034 before the conclusion of its clinical trial, despite the promising clinical results

	As a pharmaceutical and biological product company that wishes to conduct clinical trials and ultimately obtain marketing approval in the
	United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and their implementing
	regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising
	and promotion of our products. A failure to comply explicitly with any requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by
	the FDA or an IRB, of a suspension on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or
	distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product candidate intended to treat a rare disease or
	condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing
	and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product candidate. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA
	grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and
	approval process.

	If a product candidate that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval
	for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same
	indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan
	product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a
	competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product

	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that
	meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the
	condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic or drug may request the FDA to designate the biologic or drug as a fast track
	product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor
	provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first
	section of the application.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for
	other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no
	satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a
	new biological or drug product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological or drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating
	serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials
	establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of
	approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological or drug product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated
	approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Lastly, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, enacted in 2012, a
	sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#147;breakthrough therapy.&#148; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biological, to treat a
	serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biological may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as
	substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs and biologicals designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and receive the same benefits as drugs and biologicals with Fast Track
	designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.

	exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, a new biological generally receives eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents
	regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#146;s data to assess a biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the
	innovator&#146;s data may be referenced, but no biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The innovator may obtain an additional one year of market exclusivity if the innovator obtains an additional
	authorization during the initial eight year period for one or more new indications that demonstrate significant clinical benefit over existing therapies. This data and market exclusivity regime in the European Union of a total of 10 or 11 years
	protects against generic competition, but does not protect against the launch of a competing product if the competitor, rather than referencing the clinical data of the originator, has conducted its own clinical trials to support its marketing

	Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales,

	The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign
	governments. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drug products and medical services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to
	questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be
	sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.

	In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely
	will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the
	Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, was enacted. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way
	healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created
	measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby
	triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect
	through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including
	hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

	Our grant revenue is generated through the Australian federal government&#146;s
	Research and Development Tax Incentive program, under which the government provides a cash refund for the 43.5% (reduced from 45% at July 1, 2016) of eligible research and development expenditures, including salaries, by small Australian entities
	having a tax loss. For this purpose, small Australian entities are defined as those with less than A$20 million in revenue. This grant is available for our research and development activities in Australia, as well as activities in the United States
	to the extent such U.S.-based expenses relate to our activities in Australia, do not exceed half the expenses for the relevant activities and are approved by the Australian government. Because the grants are determined by the Australian government
	following the completion of a fiscal year based upon eligible research and development expenditures, grants are recorded in the fiscal year received rather than the fiscal year to which they relate. To the extent our research and development
	expenditures are deemed to be &#147;ineligible,&#148; then our grants would decrease. In addition, the Australian government may in the future decide to modify the requirements of, reduce the amounts of the grants available under, or discontinue the
	Research and Development Tax Incentive program. For instance, the Australian government recently released findings and a panel recommendation that if implemented would reduce the amount of the grants available to small companies such as Benitec to a
	maximum of A$2 million per annum. Any such change in the Research and Development Tax Incentive program could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and financial position.

	We assess at the end of each fiscal year and half year whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication
	exists, or when annual impairment testing is required for an asset, such as goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use, we make an estimate of the asset&#146;s recoverable amount. An
	asset&#146;s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other
	assets or groups of assets and the asset&#146;s value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value. In such cases, the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash generating unit to which it belongs. When the carrying amount of an
	asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. No impairment was recorded in fiscal years 2016, 2015 or 2014.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
	current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses relating to continuing operations are recognized in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset unless the
	asset is carried at revalued amount (in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease).

	of signing the agreement, we paid Biomics A$2.5 million consisting of A$2.0 million in cash and 647,333 ordinary shares (having a value of A$500,000 at the time the agreement was entered into). These shares could not be traded until October 1, 2015
	and thereafter Biomics may only sell up to A$100,000 in value of those shares in any calendar month. Upon out-licensing a patent in this patent family we will also pay Biomics 50% of the initial licensing revenue received by us up to a maximum of
	A$3.5 million and, in the event we receive licensing revenue greater than A$6.0 million, we would pay Biomics 1.5% of licensing revenue on any such additional amounts.

	The significant movement in the foreign currency translation reserve and foreign exchange
	transactional gain or loss in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 is due to historic intercompany loan balances between Benitec and its foreign subsidiaries that are eliminated on consolidation which were deemed to be non-repayable and were
	accordingly transferred to equity during fiscal 2014. As a result of the transfer of historical intercompany receivable and payable balances to equity, these balances are translated at a historical rate and no further foreign exchange translational
	reserve or transactional gain or loss on these balances was required at June 30, 2014. The significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar, along with a high U.S. dollar cash balance following an equity placement in 2014,
	contributed to the net foreign exchange gain of A$0.6 million in fiscal 2015.

	IFRS differs from GAAP in a few respects. While we have not assessed the materiality of differences between IFRS and GAAP, we note in
	particular that IFRS permits the recording of finance income and research and development grants as revenue, unlike GAAP, under which interest and other finance income would not be recorded as revenue but instead as net finance income and research
	and development grants would be recorded as an offsetting reduction to research and development expenses. In addition, under IFRS, all employment-related expenses are reported in their own line item in our Statement of Profit or Loss and Other
	Comprehensive Income, unlike GAAP, under which employment-related expenses are generally allocated to line items such as research and development expense or general and administrative expense based on the functions performed by each applicable

	share based expenses over the service period in which the employee earns the award, which is the vesting period of the award.

	Our objective is to become the leader in

	diseases. Our strategy to accomplish this goal is to progress our pipeline of proprietary ddRNAi-based therapeutics, continue our leadership position in ddRNAi-based therapeutics, develop drugs in our core disease area, partner selectively to
	commercialize and expand our pipeline and pursue indications with high unmet medical need or a large patient population.

	or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved.

	The remuneration policy of Benitec is to align director and executive objectives with shareholder and business objectives by providing a fixed
	remuneration component and typically offering long-term incentives based on key performance areas. Our board of directors believes the remuneration policy to be appropriate and effective in its ability to attract and retain the best executives and
	directors to run and manage the consolidated entity, as well as create goal congruence between directors, executives, and shareholders.

	Executives
	typically receive a base salary based on factors such as experience and comparable industry information, options and performance incentives. Our board of directors reviews our Chief Executive Officer&#146;s remuneration package, and our Chief
	Executive Officer reviews the other senior executives&#146; remuneration packages, annually by reference to the consolidated entity&#146;s performance, executive performance, and comparable information within the industry.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The performance of executives is measured against criteria agreed annually with each executive and is based predominantly on the overall
	success of Benitec in achieving its broader corporate goals. Bonuses and incentives are linked to predetermined performance criteria. Our board of directors may, however, exercise its discretion in relation to approving incentives, bonuses, and
	options, and can recommend changes to our Chief Executive Officer&#146;s recommendations. The policy is designed to attract the highest caliber of executives and reward them for performance that results in long-term growth in shareholder wealth.

	All remuneration paid to directors and executives is valued at the cost to us and expensed. Options are valued using

	the non-executive directors and reviews their remuneration annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. The maximum aggregate amount of fees that can be paid to non-executive directors is subject to approval by shareholders at our
	annual general meeting. Fees for non-executive directors are not linked to the performance of the consolidated entity. However, to align directors&#146; interests with shareholder interests, the directors are encouraged to hold our shares.

	directors themselves agree and in accordance with our Constitution. The fixed sum remuneration for directors may not be increased except at a general meeting of shareholders and the particulars of the proposed increase are required to have been
	provided to shareholders in the notice convening the meeting. In addition, executive directors may be paid remuneration as employees of Benitec.

	The remuneration policy has been tailored to align the goals of shareholders, directors, and
	executives. Two methods are applied in achieving this aim, the first being a performance-based bonus linked to achievement of key corporate milestones, and the second being the issuance of options to the majority of directors and executives to
	encourage the alignment of personal and shareholder interests.

	approximately 19.9% of its then outstanding issued capital (for a post-issue holding of approximately 16.7%). The shares were priced at A$0.0895 per share, representing the 7-day volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares on the ASX prior

	depends in part on the market value of our shares) in those years. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on qualified dividends. In the case of a corporate U.S. holder, dividends on shares and ADSs

	We believe the Company qualified as a PFIC for fiscal 2016. This
	arose because of the decline in the Company&#146;s stock price coupled with the fact that the applicable PFIC rules treat working capital as a passive asset for purposes of the PFIC Asset Test. As a consequence, any gain realised on the sale or
	other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs or warrant would in general not be treated as a capital gain. Instead, a U.S. holder would be treated as if it had realised such gain and certain &#147;excess distributions&#148; ratably over its holding
	period for the ordinary shares or ADSs or Warrants and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. In
	addition, dividends received with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs would not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income if the company were a PFIC either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding

	Australia operates a dividend imputation system under which dividends may be declared to be &#147;franked&#148; to the extent of tax paid on

	Shareholders. Dividend withholding tax will be imposed at 30%, unless a shareholder is a resident of a country with which Australia has a double taxation agreement and qualifies for the benefits of the treaty. Under the provisions of the current
	Double Taxation Convention between Australia and the United States, the Australian tax withheld on unfranked dividends that are not declared to be CFI paid by us to a resident of the United States which is beneficially entitled to that dividend is

	As of June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of A$18.2 million, A$21.8 million and A$31.4 million, respectively,
	primarily held in bank accounts and term deposits. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected primarily by changes in the general level of Australian interest rates. Our available for sale securities are
	subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 10% increase in interest rates would not
	have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.

	On August 24, 2015, we completed an initial public offering in the United States on The NASDAQ Capital Market of 1,500,000 American Depositary
	Shares (ADSs), representing 30,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares of Benitec, together with warrants to purchase 500,000 ADSs, representing 10,000,000 fully paid ordinary shares, pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form F-1, as amended (File No.
	333-205135), which became effective on August 17, 2015. Maxim Group LLC was the sole underwriter. Each ADS represents 20 ordinary shares of Benitec. We granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 225,000 ADSs and/or
	75,000 warrants to purchase ADSs to cover over-allotments, if any. Simultaneously with the closing, we issued and sold 75,000 warrants in connection with the underwriter&#146;s partial exercise of such option.

	over-allotment option) at a price of $9.21 per ADS and warrants to purchase 575,000 ADSs (including the warrants to purchase ADSs sold pursuant to the over-allotment option) at a price of $0.01 per warrant. The aggregate offering price of the ADSs
	and warrants to purchase ADSs (including the over-allotment option) was approximately $13.8 million. The total expenses of the offering, including underwriting discounts and commissions, were approximately $2.8 million. The net proceeds we received

	our ordinary shares. Moreover, we are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. In addition, we are not required

	The NASDAQ listing rules allow for a foreign private issuer, such as Benitec, to follow its home country practices in lieu of
	certain of the NASDAQ&#146;s corporate governance standards. In connection with our NASDAQ Listing Application, we have relied on and expect to continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance standards that are contrary to the laws,

	Although the majority of our directors currently qualify as independent under the NASDAQ Listing Rules, we have relied on and expect in the future to continue to rely on an exemption from these independence requirements
	for a majority of our board of directors as prescribed by NASDAQ Listing Rules. The ASX Listing Rules do not require us to have a majority of independent directors although ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations do recommend a
	majority of independent directors. During fiscal 2015, we did, however, have a majority of directors who were &#147;independent&#148; as defined in the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations, which definition differs from
	NASDAQ&#146;s definition. Accordingly, because Australian law and generally accepted business practices in Australia regarding director independence differ from the independence requirements under NASDAQ Listing Rules, we may seek to claim this

	We will rely an exemption from the requirement that at least two members of a compensation committee be &#147;independent&#148; as defined in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). The ASX Listing Rules and Australian law do not
	require an Australian company to establish a compensation committee, known in Australia as a remuneration committee, which is comprised solely of non-executive directors if the company is not included in the S&amp;P/ASX300 Index at the beginning of
	its fiscal year. Benitec was not included on the S&amp;P/ASX300 Index at the beginning of its last fiscal year and, hence, is not required under ASX Listing Rules to have a remuneration (compensation) committee. The ASX Corporate Governance
	Principles and Recommendations contain a non-binding recommendation that all ASX-listed companies should have a remuneration committee comprised of at least three members, a majority of whom (including the chair) are &#147;independent&#148;. While
	these recommendations contain guidelines for assessing independence, ASX-listed entities are able to adopt their own definitions of an independent director for this purpose and is different from the definition in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). That being
	said, Benitec has, and expects to continue to have, a Remuneration and Nominations Committee consisting of three non-executive directors.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Benitec Biopharma Limited and subsidiaries (the
	&#147;Group&#148;) as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2016. These financial
	statements are the responsibility of the Group&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Group&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
	included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Benitec Biopharma
	Limited and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2016 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by
	the International Accounting Standards Board.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The consolidated financial

	Biopharma Limited and its subsidiaries together are referred to in these financial statements as the &#145;Group&#146;.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Subsidiaries are all those
	entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the
	activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. The Companies 100% owned subsidiary, Tacere Therapeutics, Inc. has
	a 31&nbsp;December year end. The Company is reviewing the appropriate time to align the subsidiary year end to the parent&#146;s year end. For consolidation purposes Tacere prepares financial statements for the 12 month period ended 30&nbsp;June
	that are used to consolidate into the group accounts.

	Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the
	Group are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the
	policies adopted by the Group.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership
	interest, without the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration transferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity
	attributable to the parent.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Where the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and
	non-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The Group recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any
	gain or loss in profit or loss.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:0PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity
	over the vesting period. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The
	amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Market conditions are taken into consideration in determining fair value. Therefore any awards subject to market conditions are considered to vest

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the Group or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	When an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair value is based on the price
	that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal market; or in the
	absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Fair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when
	pricing the asset or liability, assuming they act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use. Valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for
	which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, are used, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

	other various factors, including expectations of future events, management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates

	The Group announced on 3&nbsp;June 2013 that it had committed to moving its non-small cell lung cancer therapeutic, into clinical development. The Group is using European-based clinical research organisation Clinical

	While the Company announced on February 20, 2016 that is was terminating the HCV program, Benitec is
	committed to completing the study and the company&#146;s estimate of the cost, assuming all patients remain in the study and the follow-up continues to 2021 is a maximum of $1.0 million. The scenario of all patients remaining in the study to 2021 is
	most unlikely and the actual cost is likely to be far less than the nominated contingency of $1 million.

	On November 11, 2014, the Group entered into a

	In addition, Benitec during the year acquired full rights to its pre-clinical hepatitis B program from its
	collaborator, Biomics Biotechnologies, to enable the independent progression of the product candidate and simplify partnering negotiations. In order to acquire full rights to the hepatitis B program that was previously developed by Joint Venture
	with Biomics, Benitec paid the JV partner $2.5million in upfront payments ($2million cash, $500k shares), with a further $3.5million and single digit royalties that may be payable to Biomics, in the instance that constructs developed during the
	joint venture are commercialised. Commercialisation is uncertain at this time.

	On October 24, 2016, Benitec entered into a strategic engagement with Nant Capital, LLC. The
	strategic engagement includes a scientific collaboration in clinical programs and an immediate private placement to Nant Capital, LLC of 29,305,819 ordinary shares in Benitec, representing approximately 19.9% of its then outstanding issued capital
	(for a post-issue holding of approximately 16.7%). The shares were priced at A$0.0895 per share, representing the 7-day volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares on the ASX prior to the execution of a share purchase subscription
	agreement. Jerel A. Banks, the Chief Investment Officer of Nant Capital, LLC, has been appointed to the Board of Benitec.

	Approval of
	shareholders will be sought for the issue of up to an additional 29,305,819 ordinary shares to Nant Capital, LLC within three months after Benitec&#146;s 2016 annual shareholders meeting (to be held on December 14, 2016) which, should the issue
	proceed, would result in Nant Capital, LLC holding approximately 28.6% of the issued capital of Benitec. The capital raised will be used to fund technology to be sublicensed from NantWorks, LLC and to fund our existing therapeutic candidate
	development programs. Nant Capital, LLC could only be required to purchase the additional ordinary shares if it has entered into a collaboration agreement with Benitec and the purchase price would be market price.

	Benitec and Nant Capital, LLC have agreed to use their reasonable efforts to enter into a scientific collaboration agreement (by December 30,

	(&#147;SCCHN&#148;), and the intended development of a ddRNAi program that would represent a second generation therapeutic for the treatment of SCCHN.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Benitec Biopharma Limited and subsidiaries (the
	&#147;Group&#148;) as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2015. These financial

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Group&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
	included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Benitec Biopharma
	Limited and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2015 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by

	option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding
	increase in equity over the vesting period. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the
	vesting period. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Market conditions are taken into consideration in determining fair value. Therefore any awards subject to market conditions are considered to vest

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If equity-settled awards are modified, as

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the Group or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated

	forfeited.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	When an asset or liability,
	financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
	participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal market; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Fair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming they act in their economic best
	interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use. Valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, are used,
	maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

	This standard is currently applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1&nbsp;January 2018. The standard provides a
	single standard for revenue recognition. The core principle of the standard is that an entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
	expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services). It is expected that the Group will adopt this standard from 1&nbsp;July 2018. The impact of adoption is likely to be immaterial, however a full impact assessment has yet to be

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial
	statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on
	other various factors, including expectations of future events, management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates
	and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are discussed below.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Research and development expenses relate primarily to the cost of conducting clinical and pre-clinical trials. Clinical development costs are a significant
	component of research and development expenses. Estimates have been used in determining the expense liability under certain clinical trial contracts where services have been performed but not yet invoiced. Generally the costs, and therefore
	estimates, associated with clinical trial contracts are based on the number of patients, drug administration cycles, the type of treatment and the outcome being measured. The length of time before actual amounts can be determined will vary depending
	on length of the patient cycles and the timing of the invoices by the clinical trial partners.

	September&nbsp;30, 2016, as permitted under NASDAQ Rule 5605(c)(4)(B), by appointing a new independent director to our Audit and Risk Committee.
