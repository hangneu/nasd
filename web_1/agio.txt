	medicines. Our therapeutic areas of focus are cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders, which are a broad group of more than 600 rare genetic diseases caused by mutations, or defects, of
	single metabolic genes. In both of these areas, we are seeking to unlock the biology of cellular metabolism as a platform to create transformative therapies. Our most advanced cancer product candidates are enasidenib and ivosidenib
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	(AG-120),
</FONT>
	which target mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 and 1, or IDH2 and IDH1, respectively, and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	AG-881,
</FONT>
	which targets both mutated IDH1 and mutated IDH2. These mutations
	are found in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The lead product candidate in our rare genetic metabolic disorder, or RGD, programs,
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	AG-348,
</FONT>
	targets pyruvate
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	for the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a rare disorder that often results in severe hemolytic anemia due to inherited mutations in the pyruvate kinase enzyme within
	red blood cells.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The clinical development strategy for all of our product candidates includes a precision approach with initial study designs that allow
	for genetically or biomarker defined patient populations, enabling the potential for proof of concept early in clinical development, along with the potential for accelerated approval. Our ability to identify, validate and drug novel targets is
	enabled by a set of core capabilities. Key proprietary aspects of our core capabilities in cellular metabolism include our ability to measure the activities of numerous metabolic pathways in cells or tissues in a high throughput fashion and our
	expertise in &#147;flux biochemistry.&#148; This refers to the dynamic analysis of how metabolites, which are intermediates or small molecule products of metabolism, accumulate or diminish as they are created or chemically altered by multiple
	networks of metabolic enzymes. Complex mathematical modeling of metabolic pathways, enzymatic activity and the flux of metabolites through metabolic enzymatic reactions within diseased tissues allow us to identify novel biological parameters that
	can be measured to characterize a disease state or the effect of therapy, or biomarkers, and targets for drug discovery.

	enables us to identify altered metabolic pathways within abnormal cells such as in rapidly proliferating cancers and RGDs, and our efforts in the field of metabolic immuno-oncology, or MIO, are focused on the research and development of
	immunotherapies against certain metabolic targets that exert their antitumor efficacy primarily via the immune system.

	Cancer is a disease characterized by unregulated cell growth. Cancer typically develops when the repair of genetic material in normal cells begins
	to fail and genes that regulate cell growth become disrupted. Carcinogens, or cancer causing agents, such as radiation, chemicals and hormones, can trigger changes to the genetic material of a cell, and typically prompt this disruption. Cells that
	have been disrupted may become cancerous, leading to changes in the cells&#146; DNA, and ultimately uncontrolled growth. Cancer cells can spread to other areas of the body, or metastasize, and form tumors, which can destroy normal tissue or organs.
	Risk factors for cancer include family history, age, diet, and exogenous factors, such as exposure to ultraviolet sunlight and smoking. Cancers can be classified in stages to document disease severity, measured in stages of I to IV, generally based
	on tumor size, involvement of lymph nodes, and metastases.

	The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug
	therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination of these methods. These treatment regimens are often associated with side effects, including fatigue, infection, nausea and vomiting and pain. Surgery and radiation therapy are
	particularly effective in patients in whom the disease is localized. Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations in which the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The goal of
	drug therapy is to kill cancer cells or to damage cellular components required for rapid growth and survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several
	decades, drug therapy has evolved from

	Cancer metabolism is a new and exciting field of biology that provides a
	fundamentally different approach to treating cancer. Cancers become addicted to certain fuel sources and inherently alter their cellular machinery to change how they consume and utilize nutrients. Cancer cells increase the transport of nutrients
	into the cell by
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	200-400
</FONT>
	fold compared to normal cells while also mutating metabolic enzymes to generate metabolites that fuel growth and altering gene expression of enzymes to divert energy production.
	Collectively, these changes afford cancer cells the ability to generate the building blocks that drive tumor growth. Inhibiting key enzymes in cancer cell specific metabolic pathways has the potential to disrupt tumor cell proliferation and survival
	without affecting normal cells, thus providing a powerful new intervention point for discovery and development of novel targeted cancer therapeutics. Our research is directed at identifying such metabolic targets and discovering medicines against
	them.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Validation of the concept of cancer cell metabolic rewiring and excessive nutrient uptake comes from the widespread use of positron emission
	tomography, or PET, to detect cancers. This medical imaging technology relies on the uptake of nutrients, namely sugar, into cells. Patients are injected with a radioactively labeled form of sugar, which is more rapidly consumed by cancer cells
	given their profound requirement for nutrients relative to normal tissues. PET imaging precisely locates cancerous areas throughout the body and provides for both a diagnostic and prognostic tool throughout cancer therapy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The metabolic rewiring of cancer cells can also be linked to specific genetic alterations in oncogenes (which are genes that transform normal cells into tumor
	cells) and tumor suppressor genes (which are genes that are anti-oncogenic) responsible for cell signaling. These mutations in signaling pathways can drive excessive uptake of nutrients and altered metabolic pathways, thereby causing cancer
	formation. This cross talk between cell signaling and metabolism offers multiple opportunities to treat cancer by combining our therapies directed against metabolic enzymes with existing or emerging standards of care.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Rare genetic metabolic disorders, a subset of orphan genetic metabolic diseases, are a broad group of more than 600 rare genetic diseases caused by mutations
	of single metabolic genes. In these disorders, the defect of a single metabolic enzyme disrupts the normal functioning of a metabolic pathway, leading to either aberrant accumulation of &#147;upstream&#148; metabolites which may be toxic or
	interfere with normal function or reduced ability to synthesize essential &#147;downstream&#148; metabolites or other critical cellular components. RGDs are also referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or rare genetic disorders of metabolism.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Most of these diseases are rare or ultra-rare orphan diseases, often with severe or life-threatening features. A disorder is considered orphan if it
	affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or fewer than five per 10,000 people in the European Union. In a study in British Columbia, the overall incidence of RGDs was estimated to be 70&nbsp;per 100,000 live births or one in 1,400
	births, overall representing more than approximately 15% of single gene disorders in the population. Incidence of a single RGD can vary widely but is generally rare, usually equal to or less than one per 100,000 births. Many RGDs are likely to be
	under-diagnosed given the lack of available therapies or diagnostics and the rarity of the condition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Current treatment options for these disorders are
	limited. Diet modification or nutrient supplementation can be beneficial in some RGDs. Several of these disorders, from a group known as lysosomal storage diseases, have been treated successfully with enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, the
	therapeutic administration of a functional version of the defective enzyme. Examples of ERTs for lysosomal storage disorders include Fabrazyme

	Unfortunately, most mutations driving RGDs are intracellular and not amenable for treatment with enzyme replacement therapies. As a result,
	despite the promising progress made for patients with a small group of these diseases, the vast majority of patients with RGDs have few therapeutic options available, and the standard of care is palliative, meaning treatment of symptoms with no
	effect on underlying disease mechanisms. We are taking a novel small molecule approach to correct the metabolic defects within diseased cells with a goal of developing transformative medicines for patients.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Using our proprietary metabolic platform, we and our collaborators examined the mutated pathway and discovered that the mutated
	IDH enzymes had adopted a novel &#147;gain of function&#148; activity that allows only the mutated IDH enzyme to produce large amounts of a metabolite called 2-hydroxygluturate, or 2HG. We have shown that the excessive levels of the metabolite 2HG
	produced by the tumor fuel cancer growth and survival via multiple cellular changes that lead to a block in cell maturation, or differentiation. We have shown that inhibition of these mutated proteins could lead to clinical benefit for the subset of
	cancer patients whose tumors carry these mutations. By reducing elevated 2HG levels, our IDH inhibitors reverse the block in cellular differentiation, allowing tumorous cells to differentiate into normally functioning cells in patients with acute
	myeloid leukemia, or AML. We have identified selective development candidates that separately target and inhibit the mutated forms of IDH1 and IDH2.&nbsp;To date, our clinical data with enasidenib and ivosidenib (AG-120), our lead inhibitors of
	mutant IDH2 and IDH1, respectively, demonstrate a mechanism of response that is consistent with preclinical studies, including substantial reduction of plasma 2HG levels, as well as evidence of cellular differentiation, normalization of cell counts
	and mutational clearance in the bone marrow and blood. This differentiation effect is distinct from that seen with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, which lead to cell death, commonly used to treat cancer.

	Enasidenib is an orally available, selective, potent inhibitor of the mutated IDH2 protein, making it a highly targeted therapeutic candidate for the treatment
	of patients with cancers that harbor IDH2 mutations, including those with AML, who have a historically poor prognosis. In December 2016, our partner Celgene submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA,
	for enasidenib in relapsed and/or refractory AML, or R/R AML. The NDA is based on data from the ongoing phase 1/2 study of enasidenib

	August&nbsp;2014, we announced that the FDA granted fast track designation to enasidenib for treatment of patients with AML that harbor an IDH2 mutation. In April 2016, we and Celgene received European Medicines Agency, or EMA, orphan drug
	designation for enasidenib for the treatment of AML. We continue to evaluate enasidenib in clinical trials evaluating hematological cancers with IDH2 mutations. To date, all clinical data reported by us and Celgene in hematological cancers

	Enasidenib is

	dose-escalation phase and the following five expansion cohorts, all of which have completed accrual: (i)&nbsp;a cohort of 25 patients aged 60 years or older with IDH2 mutant-positive R/R AML, or any IDH2-mutant positive AML patient, regardless of
	age, who has relapsed following a bone marrow transplant, or BMT; (ii)&nbsp;a cohort of 25 patients aged less than 60 years with IDH2 mutant-positive R/R AML, not including patients with AML who have relapsed following a BMT; (iii)&nbsp;a cohort of
	25 patients aged 60 years or older with untreated IDH2 mutant-positive AML who decline standard of care chemotherapy; (iv)&nbsp;a cohort of 25 patients with IDH2 mutant-positive advanced hematologic malignancies not eligible for cohorts for the
	previous three cohorts; and (v)&nbsp;a cohort of approximately 125 patients with IDH2 mutant-positive AML who are in second or later relapse, refractory to second-line induction or reinduction treatment, or have relapsed after allogeneic
	transplantation.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2015, we reported clinical data, as of September&nbsp;1, 2015, from the dose escalation phase and expansion cohorts of this
	trial, which included 209 response-evaluable enrolled patients with IDH2 mutant-positive AML. The data were presented at the 2015 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in Orlando, Florida, or ASH 2015, and showed
	investigator-assessed objective responses in 79 out of 209 response-evaluable patients. Of the 79 patients who achieved an objective response, there were 37 complete remissions (CR), three complete remissions with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp),
	14 marrow complete remissions (mCR), three complete remissions with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) and 22 partial remissions (PR). A CR is determined by using well-established criteria, which requires no evidence of leukemia in the bone
	marrow and blood accompanied by full restoration of all blood counts to normal ranges. A CRp means all the criteria for CR are met except that platelet counts are outside of the normal range. Platelets are one of the three major types of blood
	cells. A mCR means that there is no evidence for leukemia in the marrow but the blood counts have not fully restored. A CRi means there is no evidence for leukemia in the marrow but the neutrophils, a subset of white blood cells responsible for
	fighting bacterial infections, are outside the normal range. A PR means all the criteria for CR are met except that the immature defective blood cells, or leukemia, in the bone marrow are in the 5% to 25% range and have been decreased by at least

	10 achieved an objective response, including four CRs, one CRp, one mCR and four PRs. Of the 14 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, seven achieved an objective response, including three CRs, one CRp and three mCRs. Responding R/R AML
	patients were on the trial for up to 18 months with a median duration of treatment of 6.8 months, ranging from 1.8 to 18 months. Responses were durable, with median response duration of 6.9 months in patients with R/R AML. A safety analysis was
	conducted for all 231 treated patients. The majority of adverse events, or AEs, reported by investigators were mild to moderate, with the most common being nausea, diarrhea, fatigue and febrile neutropenia. The serious adverse events, or SAEs,
	observed during the trial were mainly disease related. Twenty-three percent of patients had treatment-related SAEs, including notably differentiation syndrome (4 percent), leukocytosis (4 percent) and nausea (2 percent). Drug-related Grade 5 SAEs
	included atrial flutter (one patient), cardiac tamponade (one patient), pericardial effusion (one patient) and respiratory failure (one patient). Dose escalation has been completed and a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, has not been reached.
	Enasidenib continued to show favorable drug exposure and pharmacokinetics at all doses tested with substantial reductions in plasma levels of 2HG, which is produced by the mutated IDH2 and IDH1 proteins, to the level observed in healthy volunteers.

	Pyruvate

	PKM2). PKR is the isoform of pyruvate kinase that is present in red blood cells. Mutations in PKR cause defects in red cell glycolysis and lead to a hematological RGD known as pyruvate kinase deficiency, or PK deficiency. Glycolysis is the only
	pathway available for red blood cells to maintain the production of ATP, or
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	which transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. Accordingly, total absence of the PKR

	people, and we believe that the disease is likely under-diagnosed. There is no unique ethnic or geographic representation of the disease. The disease manifests by
	mild to severe forms of anemia caused by the excessive premature destruction of red blood cells. The precise mechanism for the destruction is not well understood but is thought to result from membrane instability secondary to the metabolic defect
	caused by the low level of PKR enzyme. The hemolysis is &#147;extra-vascular&#148; in that the red blood cells are destroyed in small capillaries or organs and not spontaneously breaking open in the circulation. PK deficiency is an autosomal
	recessive disease whereby all patients inherit two mutations, one from each parent. More than 250 different mutations have been identified to date. The mutations observed in PK deficiency patients are classified in two main categories. A missense
	mutation causes a single amino acid change in the protein, generally resulting in some functional protein in the red blood cells.&nbsp;A
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-missense
</FONT>
	mutation is any mutation other than a missense mutation,
	generally resulting in little functional protein in the red blood cells. It is estimated that 53&nbsp;percent of patients with PK deficiency have two missense mutations, 25&nbsp;percent have one missense and one

	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United
	States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-provisional
</FONT>
	patent application. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which
	compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent
	that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the
	FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each medicine and other factors. There can be no assurance that any
	of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.

	As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our
	product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of
	patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the
	priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in
	interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development
	and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization,
	thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.

	Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and

	Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or

	could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of
	generic medicines. There are many generic medicines currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional medicines are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our therapeutic product

	Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with
	GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols
	detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent
	protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and
	places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to
	commence. Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may place a clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing
	investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more
	than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only
	resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the
	investigation can proceed.

	In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any
	clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information
	to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their

	In
	addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine
	whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and
	whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or
	certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk

	more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant
	endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process;

	The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful
	therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such
	a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity
	or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure
	the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a
	variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory
	studies to verify and describe the product&#146;s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of phase 4 or post-approval clinical
	trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic
	drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or
	ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the
	generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are &#147;abbreviated&#148; because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and
	effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.

	Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the
	RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is
	&#147;bioequivalent&#148; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#147;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the
	listed drug.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is &#147;therapeutically equivalent&#148; to the RLD in its
	publication &#147;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#148; also referred to as the &#147;Orange Book.&#148; Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the
	RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#146;s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the
	prescribing physician or patient.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-patent
</FONT>
	exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-patent
</FONT>
	data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For
	the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or
	pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in
	which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDCA also provides for a period of three
	years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This
	three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a
	previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval
	for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.

	application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval
	of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
	Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater
	efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.

	Under the FDCA,

	diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United
	States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval,
	registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval
	from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It
	involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device&#146;s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other
	things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and
	adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding
	analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer&#146;s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control,
	documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not
	approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the
	PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant&#146;s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in
	order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the
	deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several
	months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited
	than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion,
	sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial

	for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals.
	Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidate could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material
	adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s
	determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
	Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

	The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this
	effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and
	cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company&#146;s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and
	third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies
	and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

	Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidate will face challenges.
	Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to
	conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidate or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after
	a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so called health technology assessments, in
	order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the
	prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the
	market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the
	amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union.
	The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may
	further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	low-priced
</FONT>
	and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable
	reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.

	Other legislative

	Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction
	to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action
	is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment
	centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. With the new Administration and Congress, there will likely be additional legislative changes, including
	potential repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. It remains to be seen, however, precisely what the new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted and what impact it will have on the availability of

	To become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize a medicine or medicines with
	significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these product
	candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that
	are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. We are currently in clinical testing stages for our most advanced product candidates. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or
	annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline
	in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.

	We, and any collaborators, are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing

	comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive
	clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Celgene submitted an NDA to the FDA for enasidenib in relapsed and/or refractory, or R/R, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, in December 2016. We plan to

	Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. We cannot

	failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of adverse events that are severe or medically or commercially unacceptable, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory

	Utilizing our precision medicine approach, we focus our development activities on genetically or biomarker
	defined patients most likely to respond to our therapies. As a result, the potential patient populations for our clinical trials are narrowed, and we may experience difficulties in identifying and enrolling a sufficient number of patients in our
	clinical trials. In particular, the successful completion of our clinical development program for
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	AG-348
</FONT>
	for the treatment of PK deficiency is dependent upon our ability to enroll a sufficient number of
	patients with PK deficiency. PK deficiency is a rare disease with a small patient population. Further, there are only a limited number of specialist physicians that regularly treat patients with PK deficiency and major clinical centers that support
	PK deficiency are concentrated in a few geographic regions. The small population of patients, the nature of the disease and limited trial sites may make it difficult for us to enroll enough patients to complete our clinical trials for

	In addition, other companies are conducting clinical
	trials, or may in the future conduct clinical trials, which may have similar eligibility criteria as our current or future clinical trials. For example, Novartis International AG, or Novartis, is currently conducting a phase 1 clinical trial of its
	IDH1 mutant inhibitor, IDH305, in patients with advanced malignancies, and this trial and other trials may compete with our clinical trials of ivosidenib

	and/or
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	Furthermore, we rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and
	while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Our or our collaborators&#146; inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in
	significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to

	All of our most
	advanced product candidates are still in clinical stage development and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval.
	Adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, our product candidates could cause us, any future collaborators, an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical
	trials of one or more of our product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label, or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If adverse effects were to arise in patients being
	treated with any of our product candidates, it could require us to halt, delay or interrupt clinical trials of such product candidate or adversely affect our ability to obtain requisite approvals to advance the development and commercialization of
	such product candidate. If any of our product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we, or any future collaborators, may need to abandon development or limit development of
	that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise
	in earlier stage testing for treating cancer, RGDs or other diseases have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. For instance, in December 2016, we withdrew our investigational new drug application
	for

	our first PKR activator, we cannot provide any assurances that there will not be similar or other treatment-related severe adverse events in DRIVE PK or our other clinical trials, that our other trials will

	The outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and
	interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict success in future clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving
	positive results in earlier development, and we could face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent
	until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often
	susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product
	candidates. Even if we, or future collaborators, believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing

	In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical

	clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If we fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects

	The commercial success of our product

	insurers. If coverage and reimbursement is not available, or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we, or any future collaborators, may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the
	approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us, or any future collaborators, to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our or their investments. In the United States, no uniform policy of
	coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly

	marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenue we are able to generate from

	Patients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the
	costs associated with their treatment. Therefore, our ability, and the ability of any future collaborators, to commercialize any of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and
	related treatments will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost containment, both in the United States
	and elsewhere. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability or that of any future collaborators to
	sell our product candidates profitably. These payors may not view our products, if any, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers, or those of any future collaborators, or may not be sufficient to allow
	our products, if any, to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us, or any future collaborators, to decrease the price we, or they, might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product
	revenue. If the prices for our products, if any, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the
	drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development,
	manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, by way of example, according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on reimbursement levels already set for
	lower cost drugs or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, increasingly, third-party payors are requiring higher
	levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies and are challenging the prices charged. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that we, or any future collaborator, commercialize and,
	if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may
	be sold at lower prices than in the United States. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any of our product candidates for which we, or any future collaborator, obtain
	marketing approval could significantly harm our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.

	The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in
	recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being
	issued that protect our technology or medicines or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and medicines. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other
	countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific
	literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore we cannot be certain that we
	were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.

	Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to
	the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. Beginning in March 2013, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming the other requirements for
	patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. We may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or become involved in opposition,
	derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and inter partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could
	reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize medicines without

	or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and medicines. Given the amount of time
	required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide

	adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our medicines and technology, including interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For example, in 2011, The Leonard and Madlyn
	Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania initiated a lawsuit against us, one of our founders, Craig B. Thompson, M.D., and Celgene, alleging misappropriation of intellectual property

	Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other
	things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year that started in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2025. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among
	other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in
	Medicare and other healthcare funding and may otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and
	other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs
	may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our medicines.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, with the new Administration and Congress, there will likely be additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of certain
	provisions of the PPACA. It remains to be seen, however, precisely what the new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such
	reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product
	candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional
	activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing
	approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us and any future collaborators to
	more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.

	continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate
	through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, from
	time to time, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section&nbsp;404. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of

	Overview

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the fundamental transformation of patients&#146; lives through scientific leadership in the fields of
	cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders. The Company has built a unique set of core capabilities in the field of cellular metabolism, with the goal of making transformative, first- or
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	best-in-class
</FONT>
</FONT>
	medicines. Our therapeutic areas of focus are cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders, which are a broad group of more than 600 rare genetic diseases caused by mutations, or defects, of
	single metabolic genes. In both of these areas, the Company is seeking to unlock the biology of cellular metabolism as a platform to create transformative therapies. Our most advanced cancer product candidates are enasidenib and ivosidenib
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	(AG-120),
</FONT>
	which target mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 and 1, or IDH2 and IDH1, respectively, and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	AG-881,
</FONT>
	which targets both mutated IDH1 and mutated IDH2. These mutations
	are found in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The lead product candidate in our rare genetic metabolic disorder, or RGD, programs,
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	AG-348,
</FONT>
	targets pyruvate
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	kinase-R
</FONT>
	for the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a rare disorder that often results in severe hemolytic anemia due to inherited mutations in the pyruvate kinase enzyme within
	red blood cells.

	2016 Agreement
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May 2016,
	we entered into a master research and collaboration agreement, or the 2016 Agreement, with Celgene and Celgene RIVOT Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene. The 2016 Agreement establishes a new global collaboration focused on the research and
	development of immunotherapies against certain metabolic targets that exert their antitumor efficacy primarily via the immune system. In addition to new programs identified under the 2016 Agreement, Celgene and we have also agreed that all future
	development and commercialization of two remaining cancer metabolism programs discovered under the 2010 discovery and development collaboration and license agreement with Celgene, or the 2010 Agreement, including a program focused on
	methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, or MTAP, deleted cancers, will now be governed by the 2016 Agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the research term of the 2016 Agreement,
	we plan to conduct research programs focused on discovering compounds that are active against metabolic targets in the immuno-oncology, or IO, field. The initial four-year research term will expire on May&nbsp;17, 2020. The research term may be
	extended for up to two or, in specified cases, up to four additional
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	one-year
</FONT>
	terms by paying us a $40.0&nbsp;million per year extension fee.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For each program under the 2016 Agreement, we may nominate compounds that meet specified criteria as development candidates, and, in limited circumstances,
	Celgene may also nominate compounds as development candidates for each such program. Celgene may designate the applicable program for further development following any such nomination, after which we may conduct, at our expense, additional
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	pre-clinical
</FONT>
	and clinical development for such program through completion of an initial phase 1 dose escalation study.
</P>

	Enasidenib is an orally available,
	selective, potent inhibitor of the mutated IDH2 protein, making it a highly targeted therapeutic candidate for the treatment of patients with cancers that harbor IDH2 mutations, including those with AML, who have a historically poor prognosis. In
	December 2016, our partner Celgene submitted a NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for enasidenib in relapsed and/or refractory AML, or R/R AML. The NDA is based on data from the ongoing phase 1/2 study of enasidenib in patients
	with advanced hematologic malignancies with an IDH2 mutation. In June 2014, the FDA granted us orphan drug designation for enasidenib for treatment of patients with AML and in August&nbsp;2014, we announced that the FDA granted fast track
	designation to enasidenib for treatment of patients with AML that harbor an IDH2 mutation. In April 2016, we and Celgene received European Medicines Agency, or EMA, orphan drug designation for enasidenib for the treatment of AML. We continue to
	evaluate enasidenib in clinical trials evaluating hematological cancers with IDH2 mutations. To date, all clinical data reported by us and our collaborators in hematological cancers highlights that the mechanism of response is consistent with
	preclinical studies, including substantial reduction of plasma
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	2-hydroxygluturate,
</FONT>
	or 2HG, levels, as well as evidence of cellular differentiation and normalization of cell counts in the bone marrow and blood.
	This differentiation effect is distinct from that seen with traditional chemotherapeutics commonly used to treat AML.

	Celgene maintains worldwide
	development and commercial rights to enasidenib and Celgene will fund the future development and commercialization costs related to this program. Under the 2010 Agreement, Celgene is responsible for all development costs for enasidenib, and we are
	eligible to receive up to $120.0&nbsp;million in milestone payments and a tiered royalty on any net sales of products containing enasidenib. In January 2016, we earned a $25.0&nbsp;million milestone payment upon initiation of the IDHENTIFY clinical
	trial, as described below. In addition to contributing our scientific and translational expertise, we will continue to conduct some clinical development and regulatory activities within the enasidenib development program under the 2010 Agreement. We

	We base our
	expenses related to CROs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to
	negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development
	expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our
	estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status
	and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.

	We account for our
	stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718,
<I>
	Compensation&#150;Stock Compensation (ASC 718)
</I>
	. ASC 718 requires all stock-based awards granted to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock units,
	performance-based stock units and participation in the employee stock purchase plan, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their grant date fair values. For stock-based awards granted to employees and to members of
	the board of directors for their services on the board of directors and for participation in employee stock purchase plan, we estimate the grant date fair value of each option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The use of the
	Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates and
	expected dividend yields of the common stock. For awards subject to service-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, equal to the grant date fair value of stock options on a straight-line
	basis over the requisite service period

	For awards subject to both performance and service-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method if achievement of the performance
	criteria is considered probable.

	Since we were privately held
	through July 2013, we alone do not have the relevant company-specific historical data to support our expected volatility. As such, we use a weighted-average of expected volatility based on the volatilities of a representative group of publicly
	traded biopharmaceutical companies; this representative group also includes us. For purposes of identifying representative companies, we considered characteristics such as number of product candidates and their stages of product development, area of
	therapeutic focus, length of trading history, companies&#146; stage of life cycle, size, and relevant financial metrics. The expected volatility has been determined using a weighted-average of the historical volatilities of the representative group
	of companies for a period equal to the expected term of the option grant. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share
	price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the
	calculation.

	In May 2016, we entered into the 2016 Agreement pursuant to which we received a $200.0 million upfront payment
	and which required us to reevaluate the 2010 Agreement and AG-881 Agreements together with the 2016 Agreement. In addition, effective August 15, 2016, Celgene and we agreed to terminate the 2010 Agreement as to the ivosidenib (AG-120) program. For
	the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, we recognized $69.9&nbsp;million in revenue, which consists of $33.6&nbsp;million related to new deliverables identified under the 2016 Agreement, including $10.8&nbsp;million of revenue related to a change in
	estimate resulting from a reduction in the total level of effort required for a preclinical achievement of a program reaching earlier than planned, and the recognition of a $25.0&nbsp;million milestone payment related to a substantial clinical
	development milestone achieved. No revenue associated with the ivosidenib (AG-120) program was recognized after the execution of the 2016 Agreement.

	Revenue.
</I>
	In July 2014, we amended our 2010 Agreement which resulted in the application of new accounting
	guidance to the agreement. As a result of the amendment, we were required to evaluate the agreement under the new revenue recognition accounting guidance on a prospective basis, which resulted in additional revenue being recognized. Prior to the
	July 2014 amendment, arrangement consideration was recognized ratably over the estimated period of performance. Under this new guidance, the best estimate of selling price of all undelivered units of accounting was estimated and was determined to be
	less than the combination of future contractual consideration to be received and the remaining deferred revenue balance at the amendment date. As a result, we immediately recognized revenue on the amendment date related to the excess of total
	consideration over the best estimate of selling price of undelivered elements, which fundamentally relates to previously delivered elements under the agreement and includes the exclusive global license for development and commercialization of
	enasidenib and the reimbursement of

	on-going
</FONT>
	development costs related to enasidenib through the amendment date. For the period January&nbsp;1, 2014 through the amendment date, we recognized a total of
	$42.7&nbsp;million in revenue under the previous accounting guidance and upon the modification. We recognized $22.7&nbsp;million in revenue related to the units of accounting subsequent to the modification date. For the year ended December&nbsp;31,
	2015, we recognized $59.1&nbsp;million in revenue under the new accounting guidance, which includes $27.8&nbsp;million upon delivery of the

	Research and development expense.
</I>
	The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to net increases of $8.5&nbsp;million in
	external services and $32.9&nbsp;million in internal expenses; both of these increases are inclusive of reimbursement of costs recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses.

	We use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs, and we allocate internal employee-related and
	infrastructure costs, including stock-based compensation and facilities costs, as well as certain third-party costs, net of reimbursements from our collaboration agreements, to our research and development programs based on the personnel resources
	allocated to such program. Our allocated research and development expenses, by major program, are outlined in the table below:

	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and
	marketable securities of $573.6&nbsp;million, consisting primarily of investments in U.S. Treasuries, certificates of deposit and government and corporate debt securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is
	affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest
	rates increase. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, we do not believe an immediate 10% change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our
	investment portfolio. We have the ability to hold our marketable securities until maturity, and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest
	rates on our investments.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have contracts with contract
	research organizations that are located in Asia and Europe that are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency
	exchange rate risk. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had minimal or no liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, and the related
	consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s
	management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the
	standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
	includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
	overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements
	referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
	three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also have audited, in
	accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, based on criteria established in the Internal
	Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February&nbsp;16, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

	fundamental transformation of patients&#146; lives through scientific leadership in the field of cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders. The Company has built a unique set of core capabilities in the field of cellular metabolism, with the goal
	of making transformative, first- or best-in-class medicines. Agios&#146; therapeutic areas of focus are cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders, which are a broad group of more than 600 rare genetic diseases caused by mutations, or defects, of
	single metabolic genes. In both of these areas, the Company is seeking to unlock the biology of cellular metabolism as a platform to create transformative therapies. The Company is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

	The Company has an accumulated deficit

	ability to attain profitable operations. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, risks related to the successful discovery and development of its drug candidates, raising
	additional capital, development of new technological innovations by its competitors, protection of proprietary technology, and market acceptance of the Company&#146;s products.

	In September 2016, the Company completed a public offering of 3,370,786 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $44.50 per share. The Company
	received net proceeds from this offering of $141.0&nbsp;million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by the Company. In addition, the Company granted the underwriters the option to purchase up to an additional 505,617 shares
	of its common stock which option was exercised in September 2016 resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of $21.1&nbsp;million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions paid by the Company.

	together with the amendments, the &#147;2010 Agreement&#148;). On April&nbsp;27, 2015, the Company entered into a joint worldwide development and profit share collaboration and license agreements (collectively, the
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	Agreements&#148;). The
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

</FONT>
	Agreements establish a worldwide collaboration focused on the development and commercialization of
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	AG-881

	products. In May&nbsp;17, 2016, the Company entered into a master research and collaboration agreement (the &#147;2016 Agreement&#148;). The 2016 Agreement establishes a global collaboration focused on the
	research and development of immunotherapies against certain metabolic targets that exert their antitumor efficacy primarily via the immune system.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, the Company held both current and

<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	At December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, the Company held 158 and 74 debt securities, respectively, that were in an unrealized loss position. The aggregate fair
	value of debt securities in an unrealized loss position at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 was $335.4&nbsp;million and $207.4&nbsp;million, respectively. There were no individual securities that were in a significant unrealized loss position or that
	had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than one year as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015. The Company evaluated its securities for other-than-temporary impairment and considered the decline in market value for the securities to be
	primarily attributable to current economic and market conditions. It is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities and the Company does not intend to do so prior to the recovery of the amortized cost basis.
	Based on this analysis, these marketable securities were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015.

	Prior to the July 2014 amendment of the 2010 Agreement, the Company concluded that none of the identified deliverables had stand-alone value and, therefore,
	accounted for the deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The Company further concluded it was unable to estimate the fair value of the undelivered items within the 2010 Agreement. Upfront consideration of approximately $121.2&nbsp;million
	received was recognized on a straight-line basis through the period over which the Company expected to fulfill its performance obligations (the performance period), which was initially determined to be 6 years. In addition, Celgene purchased
	5,190,551 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock (Series B Preferred Stock) at a price of $1.70 per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $8.8&nbsp;million. The Company determined the price paid by Celgene for the
	Series B Preferred Stock represented a premium over the fair value of the Company&#146;s Series B Preferred Stock as determined by the implied value of the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to a contemporaneous valuation analysis that allocated the
	equity value of the Company to the various classes of its then-outstanding securities. The Company accounted for the $3.1&nbsp;million premium as additional consideration under the agreement and recognized the premium as revenue on a straight-line

	deliverables under the arrangement and determined its best estimates of selling price for the undelivered elements as of the modification date as vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence were not available. The Company then
	allocated the total arrangement consideration, which included the remaining deferred revenue balance at the modification date and other consideration that was deemed to be determinable at the modification date, to each unit of accounting based on

	On September&nbsp;15, 2014, the
	Company entered into an operating lease agreement (the &#147;Lease&#148;) for approximately 74,500 square feet of office and laboratory space located at 88 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Concurrently, the Company also entered into an
	agreement to terminate its preexisting lease under which the Company leased approximately 38,500 square feet of office and laboratory space located at 38 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. On November&nbsp;21, 2014, the Company entered into a
	first amendment to the Lease (the &#147;First Amendment&#148;) to expand the rentable square footage of the leased space at 88 Sidney Street to approximately 113,200 square feet. The Company became responsible for paying rent under the Lease as
	amended by the First Amendment on May&nbsp;15, 2015. The Company&#146;s lease at 38 Sidney Street terminated on June&nbsp;15, 2015. On July&nbsp;20, 2015, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Lease (the &#147;Second Amendment&#148;) to
	expand the rentable square footage at 88 Sidney Street to approximately 146,030 square feet. The Company became responsible for paying for the additional space under the Second Amendment on November&nbsp;1, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The initial term of the Lease, including both amendments, will terminate on May&nbsp;15, 2022. At the end of the initial lease term, the Company has the
	option to extend the Lease for two consecutive terms of five years at the fair market rent at the time of the extension. The Company gained physical access to the original space per the Lease in September 2014, the expanded space under the First
	Amendment in November 2014 and the expanded space under the Second Amendment in July 2015. Rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis from the date physical access to the space was provided through the end of the lease term.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Lease, including both amendments, contains rent escalation clauses and a tenant improvement allowance of $20.5&nbsp;million. The Company provided a
	standby letter of credit of $2.9&nbsp;million as security for its obligations under the Lease and both amendments in July 2015. The Company was not required to maintain any cash collateral for the standby letter of credit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded approximately $3.1&nbsp;million and $3.4&nbsp;million, respectively, in tenant improvement
	allowance to be received from the Company&#146;s landlord. Amounts received for tenant improvements, which are considered normal tenant improvements are recorded as leasehold improvements within property and equipment, net, or construction in
	progress and in deferred rent and deferred rent, net of current portion, in the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred rent will be recorded as a reduction in rent expense ratably over the lease term.

	development expense. The Company has the option to renew these licenses on an annual basis in exchange for payments approximating $70,000 for 2017. The Company could be required to make patent-related, clinical development, regulatory and
	sales-based milestone payments of up to $0.1&nbsp;million, $1.6&nbsp;million, $5.4&nbsp;million and $3.7&nbsp;million, respectively, to the licensors. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company accrued $75,000 and $500,000 related to patent
	milestones and clinical milestones, respectively, that have been achieved. The license agreements also require the Company to remit royalties in amounts ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% based on net sales of products utilizing the licensed technology. The
	Company is also required to make payments in amounts ranging from 7.0% to 25.0% for

	options primarily relate to milestone events specific to the Company&#146;s corporate goals, including but not limited to certain preclinical, clinical and regulatory development milestones related to the Company&#146;s product candidates.
	Stock-based compensation expense associated with these performance-based stock options is recognized if the performance condition is considered probable of achievement using management&#146;s best estimates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, certain of
	the performance-based milestones had been achieved. The achievements of all remaining milestones have been deemed probable as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and therefore the related expense either has been fully recognized or is being recognized over

	In June 2013, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors adopted, and in July 2013 the Company&#146;s stockholders approved, the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
	(the &#147;2013 ESPP&#148;). The 2013 ESPP is administered by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors or by a committee appointed by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. Under the 2013 ESPP, each offering period is six months, at the end of which
	employees may purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions made over the term of the offering period. The

	purchase price at the end of each offering period is equal to 85% of the
	closing price of one share of the Company&#146;s common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period, whichever is lower, subject to Internal Revenue Service limits. The Company issued 36,680 shares and 17,150 shares during the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 under the 2013 ESPP. No shares were issued during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The 2013 ESPP provides participating employees with the opportunity to purchase up to an aggregate of 327,272 shares of the
	Company&#146;s common stock. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had 273,442 shares available for future issuance under the 2013 ESPP.

	Since the Company was privately held through July 2013, it alone does not have the relevant company-specific historical data to support its expected
	volatility. As such, the Company uses a weighted-average of expected volatility based on the volatilities of a representative group of publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies; this representative group also includes the Company. For purposes of
	identifying representative companies, the Company considered characteristics such as number of product candidates and their stages of product development, area of therapeutic focus, length of trading history, companies&#146; stage of life cycle,
	size, and relevant financial metrics. The expected volatility has been determined using a weighted-average of the historical volatilities of the representative group of companies for a period equal to the expected term of the option grant. The
	Company intends to continue to consistently apply this process using similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of the Company&#146;s own share price becomes available or until circumstances change,
	such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.

	, to estimate the expected term of stock option grants. Under this approach, the
	weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the weighted-average vesting term of the Company&#146;s stock options, taking into consideration multiple vesting tranches. The Company utilizes
	this method due to lack of historical data and the plain-vanilla nature of the Company&#146;s share-based awards.

	foreign income taxes of approximately $387.2&nbsp;million, $391.5&nbsp;million and $20.2&nbsp;million, respectively. If not utilized, these carryforwards expire at various dates through 2036. At December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company also has available
	research and development tax credits for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $7.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The Company engaged in clinical testing activities and incurred expenses that qualify for the federal orphan

	Included in the carryforwards above, the Company has federal and state NOLs related to stock compensation in the amount of $81.9 million and $77.8 million,

	current accounting policy. However, the Company will adopt ASU 2016-09,
<I>
	Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

	, during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. As a result of the adoption, the net operating losses deferred tax

	Utilization of the NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to
	ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future, as provided by Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (&#147;Section&nbsp;382&#148;), as well as similar state provisions. Ownership changes
	may limit the amount of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section&nbsp;382, results from transactions that increase
	the ownership of five percent stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50&nbsp;percent in the aggregate over a three-year period. During 2011, the Company completed a Section&nbsp;382 study through December&nbsp;31, 2011, to determine
	whether any ownership change has occurred since the Company&#146;s formation and determined that transactions have resulted in two ownership changes, as defined by Section&nbsp;382. The impact of the ownership changes have been reflected in the
	Company&#146;s deferred tax assets in the table above. There could be additional ownership changes after December 31, 2011 that could further limit the amount of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards that the Company can utilize. The Company will
	complete a full analysis of the tax attribute carryforwards prior to any utilization.

	As required by ASC 740, management of the Company has evaluated the
	positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, management has recorded a valuation allowance of $208.0 million and $121.9 million at
	December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be fully realized. The valuation allowance increased by $86.1 million in the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company applies the accounting guidance in ASC 740 related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company&#146;s
	reserves related to taxes are based on a determination of whether, and how much of, a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present
	related to the tax benefit. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

	The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and Switzerland. The statute of limitations for assessment by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and
	state tax authorities is open for tax years ending December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013 although carryforward attributes that were generated for tax years prior to 2013 may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state tax
	authorities if they either have been, or will be, used in a future period. The statute of limitations for assessment in Switzerland remains open for tax year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015. There are currently no federal, state or foreign

	The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement plan, in which substantially all of its full-time employees are eligible to participate. Participants may contribute a
	percentage of their annual compensation to this plan, subject to statutory limitations. The Company will make matching contributions equal to 50% of the employee&#146;s contributions, subject to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. During the
	year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, the Company provided $1.0&nbsp;million and $0.7&nbsp;million, respectively, in contributions to this plan. The Company did not provide any contributions during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.
