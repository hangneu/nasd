</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical stage
	biotechnology company developing first-in-class antibody product candidates focused on unmet medical needs in inflammation. We develop our product candidates to address emerging biological targets using our proprietary antibody discovery technology
	platform, which is based upon a breakthrough understanding of the natural process of antibody generation, known as somatic hypermutation, or SHM, and replicates this natural process of antibody generation
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	. Our strategy is to advance
	the development of our proprietary product candidates, and for certain programs, establish partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies where we retain certain development and commercialization rights.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our most advanced wholly-owned antibody programs, ANB020 and ANB019, neutralize therapeutic targets that are genetically associated with
	severe inflammatory disorders in humans. ANB020 inhibits the activity of the interleukin-33, or IL-33, cytokine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe adult atopic dermatitis, severe adult peanut allergy and severe adult eosinophilic asthma. We
	have completed a Phase 1 trial of ANB020 in healthy volunteers in Australia under an approved Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN. We believe the results of this Phase 1 trial demonstrate a favorable safety profile of ANB020, which was
	well-tolerated and for which no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and favorable pharmacodynamic properties of ANB020, where a single dose was sufficient to suppress IL-33 function for approximately three months post-dosing as measured by an
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	pharmacodynamic assay. We plan to disclose detailed data from this Phase 1 trial at two medical conferences during the first quarter of 2017. We have cleared an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug
	Administration, or FDA, and a Clinical Trial Authorisation, or CTA, with the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, to initiate Phase 2a trials of ANB020 in patients with severe adult peanut allergy and moderate-to-severe
	adult atopic dermatitis, respectively, each of which are anticipated to be initiated during the first quarter of 2017. We anticipate top-line data from these trials to be announced during the second half of 2017. In addition, we plan to seek
	regulatory clearance during the first half of 2017 to initiate a Phase 2a trial in patients with severe adult eosinophilic asthma. We anticipate top-line data from this trial to be announced during the first half of 2018. ANB019 inhibits the
	interleukin-36, or IL-36R, receptor for the treatment of rare inflammatory diseases including generalized pustular psoriasis, or GPP, and palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis, or PPP. In November 2016, we submitted a CTN for ANB019 and, if cleared, we
	plan to commence a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial in the first half of 2017, and anticipate announcing top-line data from this trial during the second half of 2017. We subsequently plan to seek regulatory clearance to initiate Phase 2 studies of ANB019
	in GPP and PPP patients during 2018. In addition to ANB020 and ANB019, our wholly-owned pipeline includes novel checkpoint receptor agonist antibodies that we believe are applicable for treatment of certain autoimmune diseases where immune
	checkpoint receptors are insufficiently activated, and have demonstrated efficacy in an animal model of graft-versus-host disease.

	In
	addition to our wholly-owned antibody programs, multiple AnaptysBio-developed antibody programs have been advanced under our collaborations to preclinical and clinical milestones. Our collaborations include an immuno-oncology-focused collaboration
	with TESARO, Inc. and TESARO Development, Ltd., or collectively, TESARO, and an inflammation-focused collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene.

	Under our TESARO collaboration, a Phase 1 clinical trial was initiated during the first
	quarter of 2016 to study an AnaptysBio-generated anti-PD-1 antagonist antibody (TSR-042) in patients under an IND cleared by the U.S. FDA. We anticipate initiation of a registration program for TSR-042 by TESARO during the first half of 2017. A
	second Phase 1 trial was initiated during the third quarter of 2016 to study an AnaptysBio-generated anti-TIM-3 antagonist antibody (TSR-022) in patients under a separate IND cleared by the FDA. We anticipate initiation of a combination trial of
	TSR-022 with an anti-PD-1 antibody by TESARO during the first half of 2017. Under our Celgene collaboration, an
<I>
	in vivo

	dermatitis, food allergies and asthma. IL-33 directly mediates release of disease-associated cytokines, which recruit pro-inflammatory cells that mediate atopic disease. Because ANB020 inhibits
	IL-33 function, and acts upstream broadly across the key cell types and cytokines involved in atopy, we believe that its mechanism has advantages in the treatment of atopic diseases over competing agents that block only a subset of the cytokines
	responsible for atopic diseases. The role of IL-33 signaling in asthma has been recently genetically validated through human studies published in the medical literature. We have completed a Phase&nbsp;1 trial of ANB020 in healthy volunteers in
	Australia. We believe the results of this Phase 1 trial demonstrate a favorable safety profile of ANB020, which was well-tolerated and for which no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and favorable pharmacodynamic properties of ANB020, where a
	single dose was sufficient to suppress IL-33 function for approximately three months post-dosing as measured by an
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	pharmacodynamic assay. We plan to disclose detailed data from this Phase 1 trial at two medical conferences during the
	first quarter of 2017. We have a cleared U.S. IND and a U.K. CTA to initiate Phase 2a trials of ANB020 for the treatment of severe adult peanut allergy and moderate-to-severe adult atopic dermatitis, respectively, each of which are anticipated to be
	initiated during the first quarter of 2017. We anticipate top-line data from these trials to be announced during the second half of 2017. In addition, we plan to seek regulatory clearance during the first half of 2017 to initiate a Phase 2a trial in
	patients with severe adult eosinophilic asthma. We anticipate top-line data from this trial to be announced during the first half of 2018. Based on our analysis of publicly available data sources and interviews with physicians and key opinion
	leaders in the field of atopic dermatitis, we estimate approximately 1.4 million adults in the United States are affected by atopic dermatitis, of which approximately 280,000 are diagnosed with a moderate-to-severe form of this disease, of which
	98,000 are believed to be suitable for treatment with systemic biological therapies. Peanut allergy is the most common cause of food-induced allergy in the United States. Based on our analysis of publicly available data sources and interviews with
	physicians and key opinion leaders in the food allergy field, we estimate approximately 1.7 million adults are affected by peanut allergy, of which approximately 600,000 are treated by allergists and approximately 400,000 are at risk for severe
	reactions and therefore we believe are suitable for treatment with systemic biological therapies in the United States. We estimate, based on our analysis of publicly available data sources and interviews with physicians and key opinion leaders
	focused on asthma, that asthma affects approximately 19.0&nbsp;million individuals, of which approximately 3.6&nbsp;million have severe, persistent occurrence of this respiratory disease in the United&nbsp;States.

	ANB019
</B>
	is an antibody that inhibits the function of IL-36R, which we are initially developing as a potential first-in-class therapy for GPP and PPP patients. GPP is a life-threatening, rare, systemic inflammatory
	disorder that, based on our analysis of publicly available data sources and interviews with physicians and key opinion leaders in the field, we estimate affects approximately 3,000 patients in the United States with no approved therapies. Studies
	have shown that GPP can be associated in some patients with mutations that lead to abnormally high signaling through the IL-36R, which we believe can be addressed by treatment with ANB019 irrespective of whether a GPP patient has a mutated IL-36
	signaling pathway. PPP is a non-fatal form of pustular psoriasis that we estimate affects approximately 150,000 patients in the United States alone. PPP is believed to be caused by increased systemic levels of IL-36 cytokines, resulting in
	inflammatory pustules on the hands and feet of patients that cause significant inability to stand, walk or do manual work, which we believe can be addressed by treatment with ANB019. We believe ANB019 is the most advanced therapeutic antibody
	targeting IL-36R in development. We have submitted an Australian CTN for ANB019 and, if cleared, we plan to initiate a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial in Australia in the first half of 2017, and anticipate announcing top-line data from this trial during
	the second half of 2017. We subsequently plan to seek regulatory clearance to initiate Phase 2 studies of ANB019 in GPP and PPP patients during 2018 and plan to seek FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of GPP and PPP. The FDA may grant
	Orphan Drug Designation to a drug intended to treat a disease or condition, that generally affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.

	addition, we plan to seek regulatory clearance during the first half of 2017 to initiate a Phase 2a trial in patients with severe adult eosinophilic asthma. We anticipate top-line data from this trial to be announced during the first half of 2018.
	We have also submitted an Australian CTN and, if cleared, we plan to initiate a Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial for ANB019 in the first half of 2017, and anticipate announcing top-line data from this trial during the second half of 2017. We
	subsequently plan to seek regulatory clearance to initiate Phase 2 studies of ANB019 in GPP and PPP patients during 2018. For both ANB020 and ANB019, we are conducting, or plan to conduct, our initial clinical trials in Australia, and we plan to
	then conduct further clinical development in the United States and other countries. We have elected to pursue this strategy in order to benefit from certain financial incentives that Australia makes available for biotechnology research and
	development, and because we believe that Australia provides a streamlined approval processes for the initiation of first-in-human studies and that the clinical data we generate in Australia will subsequently be accepted by the FDA and foreign

	Furthermore, delays or difficulties in patient enrollment or difficulties in retaining trial participants can result in increased costs,
	longer development times or termination of a clinical trial. Clinical trials of a new product candidate require the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, including patients who are suffering from the disease the product candidate is
	intended to treat and who meet other eligibility criteria. Rates of patient enrollment are affected by many factors, including the size of the patient population, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the age and condition of the
	patients, the stage and severity of disease, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease. We may not be able to initiate our planned clinical trials if
	we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities. More specifically, some of our product
	candidates, including ANB019, initially target indications that are very rare, which can prolong the clinical trial&nbsp;timeline for the regulatory process if sufficient patients cannot be enrolled in a timely manner.

	We have recently initiated dosing of ANB020 in humans and have never dosed any of our other wholly-owned product candidates in humans. Our ongoing and

	In order to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of
	the product candidate for the relevant clinical indication or indications through preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as additional supporting data. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects in preclinical
	studies or clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to interrupt, delay or abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other
	characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have recently initiated our
	Phase 1 clinical trial for ANB020 and have not yet initiated any clinical trials or dosed any of our other wholly-owned product candidates in humans. We have conducted various preclinical studies of our product candidates, but we do not know the
	predictive value of these studies for humans, and we cannot guarantee that any positive results in preclinical studies will successfully translate to human patients. It is not uncommon to observe results in human clinical trials that are unexpected
	based on preclinical testing, and many product candidates fail in clinical trials despite promising preclinical results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that
	believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products. In our Phase 1 clinical trial of ANB020, the most common adverse events
	were upper respiratory tract infection and headache, and the most severe was a reduction of white blood cell counts. No adverse events were determined to be drug related. Subjects in our ongoing and planned clinical trials may in the future suffer
	significant adverse events or other side effects not observed in our preclinical studies or in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. The observed potency and kinetics of our product candidates in preclinical studies may not be observed in human
	clinical trials. We have tested the dosing frequency and route of administration of our product candidates in preclinical studies, which will inform our dosing strategy for future clinical trials, however such dose and route of administration may
	not result in sufficient exposure or pharmacological effect in humans, and may lead to unforeseen toxicity not previously observed in preclinical testing. Further, if clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate efficacy to the
	satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product
	candidates.

	If further significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or
	future clinical trials, we may have difficulty recruiting patients to the clinical trial, patients may drop out of our trial, or we may be required to abandon the trial or our development efforts of that product candidate altogether. We, the FDA, or
	other applicable regulatory authorities, or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable
	health risks or adverse side effects. Some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in early-stage studies have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further
	development. Even if the side effects do not preclude the drug from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability versus other therapies. Any of
	these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.

	Further, if any of our product candidates

	Our ability to continue to develop our product candidates, and to have the potential to achieve and sustain profitability, depends on the FDA
	and foreign regulatory authorities permitting us to conduct human clinical trials and, if our products are safe and effective, obtaining approval from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities to market them and subsequently successfully
	commercializing them, either alone or with our collaborators. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing and distribution of drug and biologic products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and foreign
	regulatory authorities. Though we have cleared an IND and CTA to conduct clinical trials for ANB020 in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively, before commencing clinical trials in the United States for any other product candidate, we
	must submit an IND to the FDA; foreign regulatory authorities enforce similar requirements for initiation of clinical trials in other countries. An IND or foreign equivalent requires extensive preclinical studies, and there is no guarantee that the
	FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will allow clinical trials to proceed based on the IND or equivalent submission. For example, although we have initiated toxicology studies for our product candidates, the FDA in the United States, the TGA in
	Australia or other foreign regulatory authorities, as applicable, may not allow our clinical trials to proceed in the regulatory authority&#146;s jurisdiction if we are unable to show safety margins acceptable to the particular regulatory authority
	in appropriate animal species in our preclinical toxicology studies.

	countries without marketing approval from foreign regulatory authorities. Obtaining approval of a BLA or other marketing approvals is often a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process over which the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have
	substantial discretion. Other than submitting and receiving acceptance for our CTN for ANB020 in Australia, obtaining clearance for our IND for a Phase 2a clinical trial of ANB020 in severe adult peanut allergy in the United States, obtaining
	clearance for our CTA for a Phase 2a clinical trial of ANB020 in moderate-to-severe adult atopic dermatitis in the United Kingdom and submitting a CTN for ANB019 in Australia, we have not yet discussed with the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities
	the development plans for any of our product candidates or the designs of any of our later-stage clinical studies. We thus may not have the full benefit of the FDA&#146;s or foreign regulatory authorities&#146; current thinking on trial designs or

	efficacy of ANB019 in generalized pustular psoriasis, or GPP, patients who have IL-36RA genetic mutations, we have not yet discussed clinical trial design for this indication with the FDA, and the FDA may disagree with our proposed trial design,

	our Phase 2a study to enroll only patients with severe adult peanut allergy, the protocol does not preclude enrollment of patients with non-severe adult peanut allergy. It is possible that our investigator could enroll patients with non-severe

	development, including as a result of their harmful side effects, limited efficacy or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we cannot validate

	biotechnology products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and collaborative arrangements in our

	With the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of
	biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as
	interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a biologics license
	application, or BLA. To date, only a handful of biosimilar products have been approved under the BPCIA. However, the law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and
	meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological
	products.

	develop several of our product candidates, and such collaborations currently represent a significant portion of our product pipeline. In addition, we have entered into other collaborations pursuant to which we have provided access to our technology
	platform to our collaborators to enable the optimization of their own product candidates. We have entered into antibody generation and/or development collaborations with various collaborators, including TESARO and Celgene, under which we have
	generated therapeutic quality antibodies using our technology platform and conducted certain preclinical studies in collaboration. These collaborations have provided us with $65.4&nbsp;million in non-dilutive funding through December 31, 2016. We
	are currently aware that TESARO and Celgene are advancing multiple antibodies generated through our collaboration to clinical trials. If our collaborators terminate any of our collaborations, we may not receive all or any of this funding, which
	would adversely affect our business or financial condition. Other than TESARO, our operational obligations under each of our collaborations has ended.

	Any regulatory approvals that we may receive for our product candidates will require surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the

	distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event
	reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our product candidates will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing
	information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and good clinical practices, or GCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are

	In the United States, engaging in
	the impermissible promotion of our products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the
	manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a biotechnology company on behalf of the federal government
	alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in any
	fines or settlement funds. Since 2004, these False Claims Act lawsuits against biotechnology companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements regarding certain sales
	practices promoting off-label drug uses involving fines in excess of $1.0 billion. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a biotechnology company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to
	comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and,

	trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. In addition, when studies are conducted only at sites outside of the United States, the FDA generally does not provide advance comment on the clinical protocols for the
	studies, and therefore there is an additional potential risk that the FDA could determine that the study design or protocol for a non-U.S. clinical trial was inadequate, which would likely require us to conduct additional clinical trials.

	We plan to seek Orphan Drug Designation for ANB019 or certain of our other product candidates. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions,
	including the United States and the European Union, or EU, may designate biologics for relatively small patient populations as Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic as an Orphan Drug if it is intended to treat a
	rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Generally, if a biologic with an Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the
	indication for which it has such designation, the biologic is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA, in the United States, or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the EU, from approving another marketing
	application for a drug containing the same active moiety for the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six
	years if a biologic no longer meets the criteria for Orphan Drug Designation or if the biologic is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan Drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the
	request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. In addition, the Orphan Drug Designation does not convey
	any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. Also, regulatory approval for any product candidate may be withdrawn and other candidates may obtain approval before us.

	The availability and extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able
	to afford expensive treatments. Sales of any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval will depend substantially, both in the United States and internationally, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid
	by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is
	not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or
	maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not

	There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, the
	principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services because CMS decides whether and to what
	extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors often follow CMS&#146;s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a drug
	product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support
	for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.

	Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are
	challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical drug products. There may be especially significant
	delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA approved drugs for a particular
	indication. We or our collaborators may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or
	cost effective. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be.

	Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive
	governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics
	such as our product candidates. In many countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In these countries, pricing
	negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares
	the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. In general, the prices of products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for
	products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United
	States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.

	Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and internationally, to cap or reduce healthcare
	costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in
	connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in
	general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the healthcare market.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to CMS and private payors, professional organizations such as the American Medical Association, or AMA, can influence decisions
	about reimbursement for new products by determining standards for care. In addition, many private payors contract with commercial vendors who sell software that provide guidelines that attempt to limit utilization of, and therefore reimbursement
	for, certain products deemed to provide limited benefit to existing alternatives. Such organizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of our product candidates.

	Furthermore, some of our target indications, including for GPP, are rare diseases with small patient populations. In order for therapeutics
	that are designed to treat smaller patient populations to be commercially viable, the reimbursement for such therapeutics must be higher, on a relative basis to account for the low volume of sales. Accordingly, we will need to implement a coverage
	and reimbursement strategy for any approved product candidate that accounts for the smaller potential market size.

	January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover

	Likewise, the annual Medicare Physician Fee Schedule update, which, until recently, was based on a target-setting
	formula system called the Sustainable Growth Rate, or SGR, was adjusted to reflect the comparison of actual expenditures to target expenditures. Because one of the factors for calculating the SGR was linked to the growth in the U.S. gross domestic
	product, or GDP, the SGR formula often resulted in a negative payment update when growth in Medicare beneficiaries&#146; use of services exceeded GDP growth.&nbsp;Congress repeatedly intervened to delay the implementation of negative SGR payment
	updates.&nbsp;For example, on April&nbsp;1, 2014, with the enactment of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, Congress prevented the 24 percent cut that was to occur by continuing the previously implemented 0.5 percent payment increase
	through December&nbsp;31, 2014 and maintaining a zero percent payment update from January&nbsp;1, 2015 through March&nbsp;31, 2015.&nbsp;However, on April&nbsp;14, 2015, Congress passed the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which
	was signed into law by President Obama on April&nbsp;16, 2015.&nbsp;This law repeals the SGR methodology from the physician payment formula, institutes a 0% update to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for the January&nbsp;1 to July&nbsp;1, 2015
	period, a 0.5% payment update for July 2015 through the end of 2019, and a 0% payment update for 2020 through 2025, along with a merit-based incentive payment system beginning January&nbsp;1, 2019, that will replace current incentive programs. For
	2026 and subsequent years, the payment update will be either 0.75% or 0.25%, depending on which Alternate Payment Model the physician participates.

	The patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent

	We cannot assure you that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found. If such

	interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices, or similar proceedings challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of such patents, which may result in
	the patent claims being narrowed or invalidated. Our and our licensors&#146;, licensees&#146; or collaborators&#146; patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until

	Because patent applications
	in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to a product
	candidate. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications on or before March&nbsp;15, 2013, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by such third parties to determine who was the first to invent any of the
	subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. If third parties have filed such applications after March&nbsp;15, 2013, a derivation proceeding in the United States can be initiated by such third parties to determine whether our
	invention was derived from theirs. Even where we have a valid and enforceable patent, we may not be able to exclude others from practicing our invention where the other party can show that they used the invention in commerce before our filing date
	or the other party benefits from a compulsory license. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S.
	filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to

	from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where these are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents. This includes in the United States under the Drug Price Competition
	and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. However the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in the

	licensors&#146; or collaborators&#146; issued patents. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a
	number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation.

	An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March&nbsp;16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a &#147;first-to-file&#148;
	system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us
	could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent
	application, but circumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Among some of the other
	changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those
	issued before March&nbsp;16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide
	evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use
	the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties
	and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.

	The USPTO recently
	developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and, in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective
	on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the
	prosecution of our or our licensors&#146; or collaborators&#146; patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our licensors&#146; or collaborators&#146; issued patents, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business and

	Moreover, in recent years, the Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have rendered

	Inc., and Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty
	with regard to our and our licensors&#146; or collaborators&#146; ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress,
	the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our and our licensors&#146; or collaborators&#146; ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents and

	Because we collaborate with various collaborators on the development and

	entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to disclosing proprietary
	information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to
	share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these

	unfavorable outcome could require us or our licensors or collaborators to cease using the related technology or developing or commercializing our product candidates, or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could
	be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us or our licensors or collaborators a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we or our licensors or collaborators obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our
	competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us or our licensors or collaborators. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed
	a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business.

	Many of our employees, including our
	senior management, were previously employed at universities or at other biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition
	agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used
	or disclosed confidential information or intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee&#146;s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.
</P>

	If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property
	rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be
	available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we successfully prosecute or defend against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management.

	In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how,
	technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our
	employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and
	consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a
	party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect
	trade secrets. Furthermore, if a competitor lawfully obtained or independently developed any of our trade secrets, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our
	competitive position. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret.

	Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our
	product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
	permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if
	we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain
	patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened, and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products
	sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced, possibly materially.

	Prior to this offering, no market for shares of
	our common stock existed and an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained following this offering. We will determine the initial public offering price for our common stock through negotiations with the underwriters, and
	the negotiated price may not be indicative of the market price of our common stock after this offering. The market value of our common stock may decrease from the initial public offering price. As a result of these and other factors, you may be
	unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the initial public offering price. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable.
	The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. Furthermore, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic

	conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock immediately prior to the closing of this offering. Certain of our existing stockholders and their affiliated entities, including stockholders
	affiliated with certain of our directors, have indicated an interest in purchasing up to an aggregate of approximately $30.0 million of shares of our common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price. The previously discussed
	ownership percentage upon the closing of this offering does not reflect the potential purchase of any shares in this offering by such shareholders. After this offering, this group of stockholders will have the ability to control us through this
	ownership position even if they do not purchase any additional shares in this offering. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of
	directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel
	are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and
	not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.

	The initial public offering price is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of
	our common stock. Investors purchasing common stock in this offering will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds the book value of our tangible assets after subtracting our liabilities. As a result, investors purchasing common stock in
	this offering will incur immediate dilution of $9.71 per share, based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $15.00 per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus). Further, investors purchasing
	common stock in this offering will contribute approximately 39.9% of the total amount invested by stockholders since our inception, but will own only approximately 22.0% of the shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to this offering.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This dilution is due to our investors who purchased shares prior to this offering having paid substantially less when they purchased
	their shares than the price offered to the public in this offering and the exercise of stock options granted to our employees. In addition, as of September&nbsp;30, 2016, options to purchase 1,856,750 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average
	exercise price of $4.13 per share, warrants exercisable for 117,483 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $4.55 per share and warrants exercisable for Series C convertible preferred stock convertible into 294,779&nbsp;shares of our
	common stock at an exercise price of $4.55 per share were outstanding. The exercise of any of these options or warrants would result in additional dilution. As a result of the dilution to investors purchasing shares in this offering, investors may
	receive significantly less than the purchase price paid in this offering, if anything, in the event of our liquidation. For a further description of the dilution that you will experience immediately after this offering, see &#147;Dilution.&#148;

	As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses
	that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company.&#148; We will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
	Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance
	initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs will increase our net loss. For example,
	we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the sufficient coverage. We cannot predict or

	In addition, as a public company we will be required to incur additional costs and

	of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and once we cease to be an emerging growth company, we will be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent
	registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaging in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and
	challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting,
	continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are designed and operating effectively, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting.

	In connection with the preparation of our 2015 consolidated financial statements, we and our independent registered public
	accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to the design of our controls over the calculation of our accrued research and contract manufacturing expenses, including the verification
	of the level and timing of completion of our CRO and CMO activities. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a
	control does not allow management or personnel, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control
	over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. During the first quarter of 2016, we
	implemented additional controls to remediate the material weakness, including additional controls to verify the level and timing of completion of our CRO and CMO activities and controls over the completeness and accuracy of spreadsheets used to
	calculate the accrued research and contract manufacturing expenses. We cannot assure you that these measures will significantly improve or remediate the material weakness described above. We, and our independent registered public accounting firm,
	were not required to perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we have identified all
	material weaknesses or that there will not be additional material weaknesses or deficiencies that our independent registered public accounting firm or we will identify. If we are unable to successfully remediate the existing material weakness in our
	internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify any additional issues, we may be unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the
	Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements.

	publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

	We plan to use potential future operating losses and our federal and state net operating loss, or NOL,

	We plan to use our current year operating losses to offset taxable income from any revenue generated from operations or corporate
	collaborations. To the extent we have taxable income, we plan to use our NOL carryforwards to offset income that would otherwise be taxable. However, under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the benefits from the use of our NOL carryforwards may be
	impaired or limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1984, as amended, or the Code, if we incur a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as interpreted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, over a three-year period. In
	September&nbsp;2015, we completed a Section&nbsp;382 and 383 ownership change analysis through December&nbsp;31, 2014 and determined that there was an ownership change in 2007 that may limit the utilization of approximately $5.3&nbsp;million and
	$5.4&nbsp;million in federal and state NOLs, respectively, and $0.2&nbsp;million in both federal and state research tax credits. In October 2016, we extended the analysis period of the study through December 31, 2015, noting no ownership changes
	during fiscal 2015. Our use of federal NOL carryforwards could be limited further by the provisions of Section&nbsp;382 of the Code depending upon the timing and amount of additional equity securities that we have issued or will issue, including as
	a result of this offering. State NOL carryforwards may be similarly limited. Any such disallowances may result in greater tax liabilities than we would incur in the absence of such a limitation and any increased liabilities could adversely affect
	our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

	We are a clinical stage
	biotechnology company developing first-in-class antibody product candidates focused on unmet medical needs in inflammation. We develop our product candidates to address emerging biological targets using our proprietary antibody discovery technology
	platform, which is based upon a breakthrough understanding of the natural process of antibody generation, known as somatic hypermutation, or SHM, and replicates this natural process of antibody generation
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	. Our strategy is to advance
	the development of our proprietary product candidates, and for certain programs, establish partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies where we retain certain development and commercialization rights.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our most advanced wholly-owned antibody programs, ANB020 and ANB019, neutralize therapeutic targets that are genetically associated with
	severe inflammatory disorders in humans. ANB020 inhibits the activity of the interleukin-33, or IL-33, cytokine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe adult atopic dermatitis, severe adult peanut allergy and severe adult eosinophilic asthma. We
	have completed a Phase&nbsp;1 trial of ANB020 in healthy volunteers in Australia under an approved Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN. We believe the results of this Phase 1 trial demonstrate a favorable safety profile of ANB020, which was
	well-tolerated and for which no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and favorable pharmacodynamic properties of ANB020, where a single dose was sufficient to suppress IL-33 function for approximately three months post-dosing as measured by an
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	pharmacodynamic assay. We plan to disclose detailed data from this Phase 1 trial at two medical conferences during the first quarter of 2017. We have cleared an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug
	Administration, or FDA, and a Clinical Trial Authorisation, or CTA, to the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, to initiate Phase 2a trials of ANB020 in patients with severe adult peanut allergy and moderate-to-severe
	adult atopic dermatitis, respectively, each of which are anticipated to be initiated during the first quarter of 2017. We anticipate top-line data from these trials to be announced during the second half of 2017. In addition, we plan to seek
	regulatory clearance during the first half of 2017 to initiate a Phase 2a trial in patients with severe adult eosinophilic asthma. We anticipate top-line data from this trial to be announced during the first half of 2018. ANB019 inhibits the
	interleukin-36, or IL-36R, receptor for the treatment of rare inflammatory diseases including generalized pustular psoriasis, or GPP, and palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis, or PPP. In November 2016, we submitted a CTN for ANB019 and, if cleared, we
	plan to commence a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial in the first half of 2017, and anticipate announcing top-line data from this trial during the second half of 2017. We subsequently plan to seek regulatory clearance to initiate Phase 2 studies of ANB019
	in GPP and PPP patients during 2018. In addition to ANB020 and ANB019, our wholly-owned pipeline includes novel checkpoint receptor agonist antibodies that we believe are applicable for treatment of certain autoimmune diseases where immune
	checkpoint receptors are insufficiently activated, and which have demonstrated efficacy in an animal model of graft-versus-host disease.

	In addition to our wholly-owned antibody programs, multiple AnaptysBio-developed antibody programs have been advanced under our collaborations

	study an AnaptysBio-generated anti-TIM-3 antagonist antibody (TSR-022) in patients under a separate IND cleared by the FDA. We anticipate initiation of a combination trial of TSR-022 with an anti-PD-1 antibody by TESARO during the first half of

	As of September 30, 2016,
	we had an accumulated deficit of $50.3 million primarily as a result of losses incurred since our inception in 2005. Although we reported net income of $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and $0.3 million during the nine months
	ended September 30, 2016, we expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years as we advance our products through clinical development, seek regulatory approval, prepare for and, if approved, proceed to,
	commercialization, expand our operations and facilities and grow in new and existing markets, territories and industries. We will need substantial additional funding to pay expenses relating to our operating activities, including significant
	research and development expenses. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At December 31, 2015, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards of $34.5 million and $41.5 million, respectively. The federal and state NOLs

	carryforward will begin to expire in 2026 and the California state credits carry forward indefinitely.

	The NOL carryforward and the
	research tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions if we experience one or more ownership changes which
	would limit the amount of NOL and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Code, results from transactions
	increasing ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of the corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. In September&nbsp;2015, we completed an IRC Section&nbsp;382/383 ownership change analysis
	through December&nbsp;31, 2014 and determined that there was an ownership change in 2007 that may limit the utilization of approximately $5.3&nbsp;million and $5.4&nbsp;million in Federal and state NOLs, respectively, and $0.2&nbsp;million in both
	Federal and state research tax credits. In October 2016, we extended the analysis period of the study through December 31, 2015, noting no ownership changes during fiscal 2015. If a change in ownership occurs as a result of this offering, additional
	NOL and tax credits carryforwards could be eliminated or restricted. Limitations on our ability to use NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income tax earlier
	than would be required if such limitations were not in effect. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.

	As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date.
	This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the
	service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued
	expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our
	accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by our vendors in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We base our expenses related to research and development activities on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to
	quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances
	in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the
	level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Advance payments for goods and services that will be
	used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.

	The guideline public company method, or GPC method, compares the subject company with guideline publicly traded companies. Valuation multiples are calculated from selected

	characteristics) to the subject company. These valuation multiples are evaluated and adjusted based on the strengths and weaknesses of the subject company relative to the selected guideline companies. Finally, the multiples are applied to the

	Our per share common stock value was estimated by allocating the equity value using the OPM at each valuation date up through
	December&nbsp;31, 2014. Starting from our March&nbsp;31, 2015 contemporaneous valuation, we used the PWERM to allocate the equity value to each element of our capital structure, including our common stock. For both approaches, we applied a discount

	In April 2012, the JOBS Act

	adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards

	incentive was collectible. No tax incentive was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was offset by a $3.4&nbsp;million increase in outside service for preclinical trial work, a $1.7 million increase in clinical

	During the first and fourth quarter of 2014 we received $17.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in
	upfront fees under our collaboration and exclusive license agreement with TESARO. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, we recognized the amortized portion of these upfront fees in the amounts of $7.0&nbsp;million and
	$9.4&nbsp;million, respectively. Originally, the upfront fees were to be recognized ratably through March 2016, however, in December 2015, we determined that the research and development services would be extended through December&nbsp;31, 2016, so
	the upfront fees will continue to be recognized ratably through December&nbsp;31, 2016. We also recognized revenue of $4.6&nbsp;million and $6.5&nbsp;million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, for research and
	development services performed under the agreement. We recognized revenue of $1.7&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, for the achievement of two $1.0 million milestones upon initiation of

	During 2014, we received an aggregate of $19.0 million in upfront fees under our collaboration

	Research and development expenses were $8.8 million and $8.6 million during 2013 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million. The
	decrease is due primarily to $0.4 million in lower salaries and related expenses resulting from reduced research and development positions, due to the completion of multiple collaborations during 2013 and early 2014, $0.3 million in lower
	depreciation expense, and $0.1 million in lower in-licensing fees due to the expiration of one of our contracts. These decreases were partially offset by $0.6 million in higher reimbursable external expense costs incurred under our collaboration
	with TESARO.

	General and administrative expenses were $2.0 million and $2.4 million during 2013 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $0.4 million. The

	feature. The increase is due primarily to the $0.4 million write-off of the remaining discount on our convertible promissory notes upon conversion of the notes to into shares of Series C-1 Preferred stock during 2014.

	We are a clinical stage

	platform, which is based upon a breakthrough understanding of the natural process of antibody generation, known as somatic hypermutation, or SHM, and replicates this natural process of antibody generation
<I>
	in vitro

	Our most advanced wholly-owned antibody programs, ANB020 and ANB019, neutralize therapeutic targets that are genetically associated with
	severe inflammatory disorders in humans. ANB020 inhibits the activity of the interleukin-33, or
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	IL-33,
</FONT>
	cytokine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe adult atopic dermatitis, severe adult peanut allergy and
	severe adult eosinophilic asthma. We have completed a Phase 1 trial of ANB020 in healthy volunteers in Australia under an approved Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN. We believe the results of this Phase 1 trial demonstrate a favorable safety
	profile of ANB020, which was well-tolerated and for which no dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and favorable pharmacodynamic properties of ANB020, where a single dose was sufficient to suppress IL-33 function for approximately three months
	post-dosing as measured by an
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	pharmacodynamic assay. We plan to disclose detailed data from this Phase 1 trial at two medical conferences during the first quarter of 2017. We have cleared an Investigational New Drug application, or
	IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and a Clinical Trial Authorisation, or CTA, to the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, to initiate Phase 2a trials of ANB020 in patients with severe adult peanut
	allergy and moderate-to-severe adult atopic dermatitis, respectively, each of which are anticipated to be initiated during the first quarter of 2017. We anticipate top-line data from these trials to be announced during the second half of 2017. In
	addition, we plan to seek regulatory clearance during the first half of 2017 to initiate a Phase 2a trial in patients with severe adult eosinophilic asthma. We anticipate top-line data from this trial to be announced during the first half of 2018.
	ANB019 inhibits the interleukin-36, or IL-36R, receptor for the treatment of rare inflammatory diseases including generalized pustular psoriasis, or GPP, and palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis, or PPP. In November 2016, we submitted a CTN for ANB019
	and, if cleared, we plan to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2017, and anticipate announcing top-line data from this trial during the second half of 2017. We subsequently plan to seek regulatory clearance to initiate Phase 2
	studies of ANB019 in GPP and PPP patients during 2018. In addition to ANB020 and ANB019, our wholly-owned pipeline includes novel checkpoint receptor agonist antibodies that we believe are applicable for treatment of certain autoimmune diseases
	where immune checkpoint receptors are insufficiently activated, and have demonstrated efficacy in an animal model of graft-versus-host disease.

	ANB020
</B>
	is a potentially first-in-class antibody that inhibits the activity of IL-33, a pro-inflammatory
	cytokine that multiple studies have indicated is a central mediator of atopic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, food allergies and asthma. IL-33 directly mediates release of disease-associated cytokines, which recruit pro-inflammatory cells
	that mediate atopic disease. Because ANB020 inhibits IL-33 function, and acts upstream broadly across the key cell types and cytokines involved in atopy, we believe that its mechanism has advantages in the treatment of atopic diseases over competing
	agents that block only a subset of the cytokines responsible for atopic diseases. The role of IL-33 signaling in asthma has been recently genetically validated through human studies published in the medical literature. We have completed a Phase 1
	trial of ANB020 in healthy volunteers in Australia under an approved CTN. We believe the results of this Phase 1 trial demonstrate a favorable safety profile of ANB020, which was well-tolerated and for which no dose-limiting toxicities were

	in the United States. We estimate, based on our analysis of publicly available data sources and interviews with physicians and key opinion leaders focused on asthma, that asthma affects approximately 19.0&nbsp;million individuals, of which
	approximately 3.6&nbsp;million have severe, persistent occurrence of this respiratory disease in the United States.

	ANB019
</B>
	is an antibody that inhibits the function of IL-36R, which we are initially developing as a potential first-in-class therapy for GPP and PPP patients. GPP is a life-threatening, rare, systemic inflammatory
	disorder that, based on our analysis of publicly available data sources and interviews with physicians and key opinion leaders in the field, we estimate affects approximately 3,000 patients in the United States with no approved therapies. Studies
	have shown that GPP can be associated in some patients with mutations, that lead to abnormally high signaling through the IL-36R, which we believe can be addressed by treatment with ANB019 irrespective of whether a GPP patient has a mutated IL-36
	signaling pathway. PPP is a non-fatal form of pustular psoriasis that we estimate affects approximately 150,000 patients in the United States alone. PPP is believed to be caused by increased systemic levels of IL-36 cytokines, resulting in
	inflammatory pustules on the hands and feet of patients that cause significant inability to stand, walk or do manual work, which we believe can be addressed by treatment with ANB019. We believe ANB019 is the most advanced therapeutic antibody
	targeting IL-36R in development. We have submitted an Australian CTN for ANB019 and, if cleared, we plan to initiate Phase&nbsp;1 trials in Australia in the first half of 2017, and anticipate announcing top-line data from this trial during the
	second half of 2017. We subsequently plan to seek regulatory clearance to initiate Phase 2 studies of ANB019 in GPP and PPP patients during 2018 and plan to seek FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of GPP and PPP. The FDA may grant Orphan
	Drug Designation to a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that generally affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.

	Bispecific antibodies.
</B>
	A bispecific antibody is a single therapeutic molecule designed to bind two different targets. Bispecific antibodies have the advantage of combining two therapeutic mechanisms with the goal
	of increasing therapeutic efficacy, in comparison to monospecific antibodies that bind either of the targets individually. We believe our competitors&#146; bispecific strategies generally rely on proteins with non-natural formats, resulting in
	unpredictable pharmacokinetics and manufacturing properties. Our strategy is to develop bispecific antibodies that are composed of two different heavy chains with a common shared light chain that resemble the natural antibody structure and exhibit
	the desired functional activity to each target. Utilizing our proprietary SHM platform, we are able to generate a large diversity of heavy and light chain varieties against each therapeutic target, and then co-mature a common light chain in the
	context of two different heavy chains, which permits us to identify bispecific antibodies with sufficient potency against each of the two targets that we believe will provide greater therapeutic benefit.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	ANB020 is a
	potentially first-in-class antibody that inhibits the activity of IL-33 and is being developed to treat atopic diseases, including moderate-to-severe adult atopic dermatitis, severe adult peanut allergy and severe adult eosinophilic asthma. Despite
	the key role of IL-33 in atopic diseases, it has been historically difficult for other antibody technologies to generate a functional anti-IL-33 therapeutic agent. We believe ANB020 is the most advanced antibody therapeutic candidate in development
	targeting the IL-33 cytokine. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 trial of ANB020 in healthy volunteers in Australia under an approved CTN.

	atopic dermatitis, food allergies, asthma and other atopic diseases. In response to pathogens, viruses, toxins or allergens, IL-33 is rapidly released from mucosal epithelial and endothelial
	cells. For example, a recent scientific study has indicated that individuals with asthma symptoms express higher levels of IL-33 than healthy control subjects. IL-33 initiates a diverse array of cellular immune responses, including the activation of
	mast cells, basophils and eosinophils, leading to production of downstream cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, which are associated with atopic diseases. IL-33 also acts on T helper 2, or Th2, effector cells and Innate Lymphoid Cell Type 2, or
	ILC2, two types of white blood cells that initiate and orchestrate atopic responses.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because ANB020 inhibits IL-33 function and acts
	upstream of key cell types involved in atopy and the subsequent release of Th2 cytokines, we believe that its mechanism has advantages over that of competing therapeutic antibodies which block only a subset of IL-4, IL-5 or IL-13 cytokines.

	Genetic studies support the importance of the IL-33 pathway in atopic diseases. These studies
	have demonstrated that certain ST2 mutations reduce IL-33 mediated signaling and thereby protect individuals with mutated ST2 from asthma. This supports the hypothesis that an anti-IL-33 antibody, such as ANB020, has the potential to benefit asthma

	A significant

	believe ANB020 may be effective across atopic diseases, we have prioritized our development efforts based on unmet medical need and potential market opportunity. We have chosen to focus our ANB020 program initially on three indications: severe adult

	individuals, have severe, persistent occurrence of this respiratory disease. As a chronic inflammatory disorder, severe asthma can lead to permanent structural damage to the airways and long-term reductions in lung function. Although many
	mild-to-moderate asthmatics respond well to currently available treatments, which include inhaled corticosteroids, or ICS, and long-acting beta agonists, or LABA, severe asthma in patients is generally not adequately controlled by such available
	therapies. We will initially focus on the treatment of severe asthma that, based on our analysis, includes 1.1&nbsp;million adult patients whose disease is not sufficiently controlled through standard-of-care therapy. We have conducted primary
	market studies that estimate approximately 45% of these patients are candidates for biologic therapies, such as ANB020.

	Existing biologic therapies include Xolair, which is approved for the treatment of moderate to

	the FDA recently approved for the add-on maintenance treatment in patients aged 12 years or older with severe eosinophilic asthma. Other emerging therapies currently in development, such as lebrikizumab, benralizumab, tralokinumab, anrukinzumab,
	dupilumab, AMG 317 and CNTO 7160, have yet to be approved by the FDA for treatment of asthma, while the FDA&#146;s Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee recommended that the FDA approve reslizumab in adult patients aged 18 years and older for
	the treatment of inadequately controlled asthma in patients with elevated eosinophils, despite an inhaled corticosteroids treatment regimen. Xolair is a difficult drug to prescribe due to complex dosing algorithms, frequent administration and risk
	of anaphylaxis, and we expect the indications for Nucala, reslizumab and lebrikizumab will be limited to asthma patients defined by biomarkers. We believe that ANB020 may have therapeutic benefit across a broad range of ICS-refractory severe adult
	eosinophilic asthma patients, and plan to utilize biomarkers during development to differentiate ANB020 relative to competitors.

	Atopic Dermatitis.

	Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 1.4 million adults in the United
	States. Human studies have demonstrated that IL-33 is highly expressed in atopic dermatitis lesions and leads to the recruitment of downstream cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) and eosinophils to the disease site in patients. By inhibiting IL-33
	function in patients, we believe ANB020 will suppress the production of the aforementioned downstream cytokines and lead to therapeutic benefit in moderate to severe adult atopic dermatitis.

	Current therapies for atopic dermatitis are generally focused on the topical use of non-biologic small molecules. Dupilumab is currently in

	topical steroids and related therapies, however such approaches have not demonstrated significant benefit for moderate-to-severe patients. We estimate that 98,000 atopic dermatitis patients would be eligible for treatment with a systemic biologic

	ANB019 is an antibody that
	inhibits the function of IL-36R, which we are initially developing as a potential first-in-class therapy for GPP and PPP patients. GPP is a life-threatening, rare systemic inflammatory disorder reported to affect approximately 3,000 patients in the
	United States alone, with no currently approved therapies. Studies have shown that GPP can be associated with mutations in the gene encoding the IL-36R antagonist, or IL-36RA, or can be caused by excessive IL-36 cytokine levels, that lead to
	abnormally high signaling through the IL-36R and thereby cause the systemic inflammatory condition, GPP. We believe ANB019 is the most advanced antibody targeting the IL-36R in development.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We submitted an Australian CTN for ANB019 in November 2016 and, if cleared, we plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial in Australia in the first half
	of 2017. We anticipate announcing top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2017. We also plan to develop ANB019 for other IL-36R driven inflammatory conditions, including PPP, which is reported to affect approximately 150,000 patients in
	the United States. We plan to seek FDA Orphan Drug Designation for ANB019 for the treatment of GPP and PPP, which we believe may be differentiated from the non-rare plaque psoriasis, or psoriasis vulgaris, based upon distinctive genetic and
	translational features unique to GPP and/or PPP.

	The IL-36 subfamily of proteins consists of the IL-36 receptor antagonist, or IL-36RA, as well as three cytokines, IL-36 alpha, IL-36 beta and
	IL-36 gamma, each of which have agonistic characteristics and signal through IL-36R. These IL-36 proteins are mainly expressed in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. The role of the IL-36RA is to dampen the inflammatory

	binding to related proteins. As shown in Figure 7 below, functional potency of ANB019 is at least 100-fold greater than IL-36RA in human systems, which is measured as the IC 50 of inhibition of interleukin-8, or IL-8, release from human
	keratinocytes. ANB019 functional activity has been demonstrated through inhibition of IL-8 secretion from human primary keratinocytes when stimulated by IL-36 gamma of approximately 0.15 nM and 1.2 nM, respectively. Lower K D and IC 50 values

	In November
	2016, we submitted a CTN for ANB019 and, if cleared, we plan to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2017. We anticipate announcing top-line data from this trial during the second half of 2017. This Phase 1 clinical trial will test
	single and multiple ascending doses of ANB019 in healthy volunteers, while also utilizing

	ex vivo

	assays to determine ANB019&#146;s pharmacodynamic activity range. Following completion of this initial Phase 1 trial, we plan to submit a U.S.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our initial patient testing of ANB019 will focus
	primarily on GPP and PPP patients. We currently plan to conduct GPP efficacy testing of ANB019 in the United States and/or the United Kingdom using a Phase 2 clinical trial expected to be initiated in 2018 that enrolls GPP patients irrespective of
	mutation status. We believe a small trial, potentially with fewer than 100 patients, may be sufficient to demonstrate substantial evidence of efficacy and safety of ANB019 in GPP.&nbsp;We intend to obtain input from FDA on clinical trial design
	before conducting a pivotal clinical trial in patients with GPP.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also intend to develop ANB019 for PPP. We anticipate initiating a
	Phase 2 trial for PPP within the United States and/or United Kingdom during 2018, followed by one or more Phase 3 pivotal registration trials. If we use a diagnostic test to select patients for inclusion in our registration program, such as a
	genetic test for IL-36RA mutations, the FDA may require that the companion diagnostic be approved or cleared for use at the time the product receives marketing approval.

	Human studies have shown that IL-36 cytokines are highly upregulated in psoriasis vulgaris, in conjunction with some upregulation of other
	inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-17A, IL-6 and IL-12. Therefore, we may, as part of our initial clinical testing of ANB019, conduct a proof-of-mechanism clinical trial with psoriasis vulgaris patients who are not currently on any
	biological therapies. In addition, we may also consider clinical development of ANB019 for patients with psoriasis vulgaris that have failed treatment with the current standard of care, including Stelara (ustekinumab) and Cosentyx (secukinumab).

	As described above, we plan to pursue a clinical development strategy that involves conducting our initial&nbsp;clinical trials in Australia.
	We are pursuing this strategy in order to benefit from certain financial incentives that Australia makes available for biotechnology research and development and because we believe that Australia provides streamlined&nbsp;approval processes for the
	initiation of first-in-human studies, which we believe will allow us to begin our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trials weeks, and possibly several months, sooner than if we pursued initiation of trials in the United States. In particular, the Australian CTN
	review process is conducted on a regional basis by a single committee, without the requirement for review by the TGA. In contrast, in the United States, the sponsor of a first-in-human clinical trial typically must engage in a series of steps that
	include submission of an IND to the FDA and waiting 30&nbsp;days for FDA feedback, if any, and then separate submission of materials&nbsp;to a review board at the trial site. Although we expect the length of each Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial, once
	initiated, will be the same as it would be if the trials were conducted in the United States, we believe the&nbsp;streamlined&nbsp;approval processes for the initiation of our trials in Australia offers us a meaningful advantage.

	In addition, we believe that clinical data generated in Australia will subsequently be accepted by the FDA and its foreign equivalents outside
	of Australia, and therefore may enable us to commence Phase 2 and possibly registration clinical trials in the United States following submission of an IND, without any need for us to repeat our Phase 1 trials in the United States. As discussed
	below under &#147;Government Regulation and Product Approval&#151;Foreign Clinical Studies to Support an IND,&#148; we believe the FDA will generally accept data from well-designed, well-conducted foreign clinical trials that are conducted in
	accordance with GCP where the FDA is able to validate data through onsite inspection, if the FDA deems such inspection necessary. We expect that our Phase 1 clinical trials for ANB019 will be well-designed and conducted in accordance with GCP and

	Through assessment of public literature and primary key opinion leader discussions, we estimate GPP affects approximately 3,000 individuals in

	which is Cosentyx. Based on this definition and our analysis publicly-available information and literature, we estimate that approximately 5% of the patient population, representing approximately 375,000 patients, is refractory to the leading

	Antibodies are complex
	proteins naturally generated by the immune system to neutralize foreign pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. B cells, a white blood cell type responsible for the generation of antibodies in response to pathogens, secrete billions of antibodies
	with different specificities into the bloodstream. Antibodies are structurally distinct Y-shaped proteins formed through the combination of two long proteins, called heavy chains, and two short proteins, called light chains. Each heavy and light
	chain pair forms a binding site where the antibody specifically binds its target, otherwise known as an antigen, at the Fab domain of the antibody molecule. The specificity of each antibody to a target, and the potency of its binding strength to
	that target are defined by the amino acid sequences of heavy and light chains in the Fab domain of the antibody molecule. The other end of the antibody, called the Fc domain, is responsible for communication between the antibody and the rest of the
	immune system. Fc domains bind to various receptors and cause immune system effector responses.

	A bispecific antibody is a single therapeutic molecule designed to bind two different targets. Bispecific antibodies have the advantage of combining two therapeutic mechanisms with the goal

	In March 2015, we
	established a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary called AnaptysBio Pty. Ltd, in order to conduct various preclinical and clinical activities for ANB020 and ANB019. We believe our Australian subsidiary will be eligible for certain financial
	incentives made available by the Australian government for biotech research and development expenses. Specifically, Australia provides a refundable tax credit in the form of a cash rebate equal to 45.0% of qualified expenditures on biotech research
	and development projects to Australian companies that operate the majority of their research and development activities associated with such projects in Australia. A wholly-owned Australian subsidiary of a non-Australian parent company is eligible
	to receive the refundable tax credit, provided that the Australian subsidiary retains the rights to the data and intellectual property generated in Australia, and provided that the total revenues of the parent company and its consolidated
	subsidiaries during the period for which the refundable tax credit is claimed are less than $20.0&nbsp;million Australian dollars. During the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, we received and recognized as a reduction in research and
	development expense $3.0 million in refundable tax credits related to fiscal 2015 eligible expenditures. In September 2016, we determined that we would meet the criteria for eligibility for fiscal 2016, therefore we recognized a reduction to
	research and development expense of $3.2 million equal to 45% of our eligible expenditures for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as collectability was considered reasonably assured. We recorded $3.3 million as a receivable as of

	covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension

	In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the
	FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring
	and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of
	the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the
	application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a
	variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution,
	injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

	Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an

	information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the
	IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial
	proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i)&nbsp;in compliance
	with federal regulations; (ii)&nbsp;in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii)&nbsp;under

	Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted
	in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects
	associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage
	tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the
	additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to
	provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory
	evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention
	of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

	After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before
	marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#146;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls.
	The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user
	fees. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to
	permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are
	reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the BLA; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has
	the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The

	The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products
	that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee&#151;typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts&#151;for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved.
	The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the
	FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that
	provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the indication studied.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After the FDA evaluates the
	BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information,
	in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such
	resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the
	FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include,
	but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the
	potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product&#146;s safety or efficacy.

	Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified
	following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA
	supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it
	does in reviewing BLAs.

	FDA approval for a biological product containing a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that
	indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of
	clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a

	Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require
	post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality
	control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and
	certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue
	to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory

	through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only
	be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to
	currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers
	are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

	The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and
	third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and
	third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may
	be implemented in the future.

	We anticipate that the ACA will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and

	For example, in August&nbsp;2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011,

	$1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went
	into effect beginning on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January&nbsp;2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other

	Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the therapeutic drug product as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety

	Clinical trials involve administering the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified
	principal investigator. The TGA has developed guidelines for a CTN. Under the CTN process, all material relating to the proposed trial is submitted directly to the HREC of each institution at which the trial is to be conducted. An HREC is an
	independent review committee set up under guidelines of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. The role of an HREC is to ensure the protection of rights, safety and wellbeing of human subjects involved in a clinical trial by,
	among other things, reviewing, approving and providing continuing review of trial protocols and amendments, and of the methods and material to be used in obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial subjects. The TGA is formally notified
	by submission of a CTN application but does not review the safety of the drug or any aspect of the proposed trial. The approving authority of each institution gives the final approval for the conduct of the clinical trial, having due regard to
	advice from the HREC. Following approval, responsibility for all aspects of the trial conducted under a CTN application remains with the HREC of each investigator&#146;s institution.

	The standards for clinical research in Australia are set by the TGA and the National Health and Medical Research Council, and compliance with
	GCP is mandatory.&nbsp;Guidelines, such as those promulgated by the International Conference on Harmonization&nbsp;of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, are required across all fields, including those
	related to pharmaceutical quality, nonclinical and clinical data requirements and study designs. The basic requirements for preclinical data to support a first-in-human study under ICH guidelines are applicable in Australia. Requirements related to
	adverse event reporting in Australia are similar to those required in other major jurisdictions.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have adopted a 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan that will become effective on the date of this prospectus and will enable eligible
	employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount beginning on a date determined by our board of directors. Purchases will be accomplished through participation in discrete offering periods. We initially reserved 218,000&nbsp;shares of
	our common stock for issuance under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will increase automatically on January&nbsp;1st of each of the first ten calendar years
	following the first offering date by the number of shares equal to the greater of 1% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock as of the immediately preceding December&nbsp;31 (rounded to the nearest whole share). However, our board of
	directors or compensation committee may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. The aggregate number of shares issued over the term of our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will not exceed 2,180,000&nbsp;shares of our common stock.
	Our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section&nbsp;423 of the Code.

	Our
	compensation committee will administer our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. While our employees generally are eligible to participate in our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, our compensation committee may in its discretion elect to exclude
	employees who work less than 20 hours per week or less than five months in a calendar year. In addition, employees who are 5% stockholders, or would become 5% stockholders as a result of their participation in our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
	are ineligible to participate in our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We may impose additional restrictions on eligibility within the limits permitted by the Code. Under our 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, eligible employees will be able to
	acquire shares of our common stock by accumulating funds through payroll deductions. Our eligible employees will be able to select a rate of payroll deduction between 1% and 15% of their base cash compensation.

	When an initial first offering period commences, our employees who meet the eligibility requirements for participation in that offering period
	will be eligible to enroll. For subsequent offering periods, new participants will be required to enroll in a timely manner. Once an employee is enrolled, participation will be automatic in subsequent offering periods. Each offering period will be
	determined by our compensation committee. An employee&#146;s participation automatically ends upon termination of employment for any reason.

	We intend to adopt a written related person transactions policy that our executive officers, directors, nominees for election as a director,
	beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, and any members of the immediate family of and any entity affiliated with any of the foregoing persons, are not permitted to enter into a material related person transaction with us without the
	review and approval of our audit committee, or a committee composed solely of independent directors in the event it is inappropriate for our audit committee to review such transaction due to a conflict of interest. We expect the policy to provide
	that any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, nominee for election as a director, beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock or with any of their immediate family members or affiliates in which
	the amount involved exceeds $120,000 will be presented to our audit committee for review, consideration and approval. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, we expect that our audit committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances
	available and deemed relevant to the audit committee, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the
	extent of the related person&#146;s interest in the transaction.

	The Code and the Treasury regulations require those who make specified payments to report the payments to the IRS. Among the specified payments
	are dividends and proceeds paid by brokers to their customers. The required information returns enable the IRS to determine whether the recipient properly included the payments in income. This reporting regime is reinforced by &#147;backup
	withholding&#148; rules. These rules require the payors to withhold tax from payments subject to information reporting if the recipient fails to cooperate with the reporting regime by failing to provide his taxpayer identification number to the
	payor, furnishing an incorrect identification number, or failing to report interest or dividends on his returns. The backup withholding tax rate is currently 28%. The backup withholding rules do not apply to payments to corporations, whether
	domestic or foreign, provided they establish such exemption.

	Payments to non-U.S. holders of dividends on common stock generally will not
	be subject to backup withholding, and payments of proceeds made to non-U.S. holders by a broker upon a sale of common stock will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding, in each case so long as the non-U.S. holder certifies its
	nonresident status (and we or our paying agent do not have actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a U.S. person or that the conditions of any other exemption are not, in fact, satisfied) or otherwise establishes an exemption. The
	certification procedures to claim treaty benefits described under &#147;&#151;Dividends&#148; will generally satisfy the certification requirements necessary to avoid the backup withholding tax. We must report annually to the IRS any dividends paid
	to each non-U.S. holder and the tax withheld, if any, with respect to these dividends. Copies of these reports may be made available to tax authorities in the country where the non-U.S. holder resides.

	Our common stock has been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol &#147;ANAB.&#148; In connection with the
	offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of our common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the
	sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering, and a short position represents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A &#147;covered short
	position&#148; is a short position that is not greater than the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters&#146; option described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any covered short position by either exercising their
	option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to cover the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in
	the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option described above. &#147;Naked&#148; short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the amount of additional shares
	for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that
	there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock
	made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the closing of the offering.

	The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This
	occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering
	transactions.

	Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their
	own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the common stock. As a
	result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. These transactions may
	be effected on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, in the over-the- counter market or otherwise.

	market maker&#146;s bid, that bid must then be lowered when specified purchase limits are exceeded. Passive market making may cause the price of our common stock to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the
	absence of those transactions. The underwriters are not required to engage in passive market making and may end passive market making activities at any time.

	as we continue our expansion, we may seek additional financing and/or strategic investments. However, there can be no assurance that any additional financing or strategic investments will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If events

	minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	We
	account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using
	enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more
	likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized based on the weight of available evidence, including expected future earnings.

	We recognize an uncertain tax position in our consolidated financial statements when we conclude that a tax position is more likely than not
	to be sustained upon examination based solely on technical merits. Only after a tax position passes the first step of recognition will measurement be required. Under the measurement step, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit
	that is more likely than not to be realized upon effective settlement. This is determined on a cumulative probability basis. The full impact of any change in recognition or measurement is reflected in the period in which such change occurs. We have
	elected to accrue any interest or penalties related to income taxes as part of our income tax expense.

	Net income (loss) per share of common stock is determined using the two-class method for participating securities to the extent this method is
	more dilutive than the if-converted method. All series of our convertible preferred stock are considered to be participating securities. In accordance with the two-class method, earnings allocated to these participating securities, which include

	Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributed to common stockholders by the weighted-average
	number of common shares outstanding during the period. All participating securities are excluded from basic weighted-average common shares outstanding. In computing diluted net income (loss) attributed to common stockholders, undistributed earnings
	(if any) are re-allocated to reflect the potential impact of dilutive securities, including stock options and warrants that reduce the preferred stockholders participation in earnings to be attributed to common stockholders. Diluted net income
	(loss) per share attributed to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributed to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common equivalent shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share
	attributed to common stockholders includes any dilutive effect from outstanding stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method.

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers
</I>
	, which outlines a single comprehensive model for
	entities to use in accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance in FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, including industry-specific guidance. This standard is based on the principle that
	an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard also requires
	additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract and becomes effective for our annual reporting period beginning January&nbsp;1, 2018, including interim periods
	within that reporting period; adoption is permitted as early as January&nbsp;1, 2017. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard. We are currently assessing
	the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

	In March 2014, we entered into a Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement (TESARO Agreement) with TESARO, Inc. and TESARO Development,
	Inc. (collectively, &#147;TESARO&#148;), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to perform certain discovery and early preclinical development of therapeutic antibodies with the goal of generating
	immunotherapy antibodies for subsequent preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial development to be performed by TESARO. Under the terms of the agreement, TESARO paid an upfront license fee of $17.0 million in March 2014 and agreed to provide
	funding to us for research and development services related to antibody discovery programs for three specific targets.

	For each development program, we are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $18.0
	million if certain clinical trial events are achieved by TESARO, up to an additional $90.0 million if certain U.S. and European regulatory submissions and approvals in multiple indications are achieved, and up to an additional $165.0 million upon
	the achievement of specified levels of annual worldwide net sales. We will also be eligible to receive tiered single-digit royalties related to worldwide net sales of products developed under the collaboration and certain commercial milestone
	payments if specified levels of annual worldwide net sales are attained. Unless earlier terminated by either party upon specified circumstances, the agreement will terminate, with respect to each specific developed product, upon the later of the
	12th anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product or the expiration of the last to expire of any patent. We determined that the upfront license fees and research funding under the agreement, as amended, should be accounted for as a single
	unit of accounting and that the upfront license fees should be deferred and recognized as revenue over the same period that the research and development services are performed. In December 2015, we determined that the research and development
	services would be extended through December&nbsp;31, 2016. As a result, the period over which the unrecognized license fees and milestones will be recognized has been extended through December&nbsp;31, 2016.

	The costs incurred to issue the Term A Loans of $85,000 were deferred and are included in the discount to the carrying value of the Term A
	Loans in the accompanying balance sheet. The Term A Loans also include a final payment fee of $0.3 million due at the earlier of prepayment or the maturity date of the Term A Loans. The deferred costs and the final payment fee are being amortized to
	interest expense over the expected term of the Term A Loans using the effective interest method.

	In connection with the issuance of
	the Term A Loans, we issued detachable, fully vested warrants to purchase an aggregate of 41,208 shares of Series C Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $4.55 per share to the lenders, which are subject to change under anti-dilution provisions.
	The warrants are exercisable at any time through December 2024. The grant-date fair value of the warrants of $0.1 million was recorded as a liability, with a reduction to the carrying value of the Term A Loans, and which is recognized as additional
	interest expense over the remaining term of the Loans. The initial fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: a stock price volatility of 70.2%, an expected life equal to
	the contractual term of the warrants of ten years and a risk-free interest rate of 1.97%.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the carrying amount of the Term A Loans was $4.9 million, which is net
	of discounts of $97,000. The Term A Loans were classified as noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December&nbsp;31, 2015 as a result of the LSA Amendment in January 2016. The effective interest rate on the Term A Loans at
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 was 9.25%. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, future principal maturities of the Term A Loans were $2.2 million, $2.6 million and $0.2 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

	In August 2013, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement, we issued convertible promissory notes to existing investors
	aggregating $2.0 million. The notes, which bear interest at 10%&nbsp;per annum, were unsecured and subordinated to all current and future indebtedness and were convertible at any time at the option of the holders into shares of Series C-1 Preferred
	Stock at a conversion price of $4.55 per share.

	Authoritative accounting guidance requires that a portion of the note proceeds be
	allocated to additional paid-in capital for the intrinsic value, if any, of the conversion option (the &#147;beneficial conversion feature&#148;) based upon the difference between the fair value of the underlying preferred stock at the date of
	issuance of the notes and the effective conversion price embedded in the notes. The resulting discount on the notes is amortized over the term of the related notes to the stated date of redemption. At August&nbsp;30, 2013, the date of issuance of
	the notes, the intrinsic value of the conversion option exceeded the net proceeds of the notes, and therefore the resulting discount attributed to the notes was limited to $2.0 million.

	In April 2014, the principal and accrued interest on the notes, which aggregated $2.2 million, were converted into 476,190 shares of Series
	C-1 Preferred Stock. The unamortized discount of $0.4 million at the date of conversion was recognized as interest expense. Total interest expense resulting from the amortization and write-off of the discount totaled $1.2 million during the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	For fair values determined by Level 1 inputs, which utilize quoted

	Our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock
	appreciation rights, and rights to purchase restricted stock to our employees, nonemployee directors and consultants. Recipients of incentive stock options shall be eligible to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to no
	less than the estimated fair market value of such stock on the date of grant. The maximum term of options granted under the Plan is ten years. On April&nbsp;29, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Plan which provided for an increase
	in the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the plan by 544,285 and on July&nbsp;9, 2015, we amended our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan by 680,978 shares. As
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015, awards for up to 2,379,158 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the Plan, of which 2,050,196 are reserved for issuance upon exercise of granted and outstanding options and 328,962 shares are available for
	future grants.

	We determine the appropriate, risk free interest rate, expected term for employee stock based awards,
	contractual term for nonemployee stock based awards, and volatility assumptions. The weighted-average expected option term for employee stock based awards reflects the application of the simplified method, which defines the life as the average of
	the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches. The weighted average expected term for nonemployee stock based awards is the remaining contractual life of the award. Estimated volatility
	incorporates historical volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available. The risk free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected or contractual term of the share based
	payment awards. The assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future.

	The above NOL carryforward and the research tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual
	limitation under Section&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions if we experience one or more ownership changes which would limit the amount of NOL and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to
	offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change as defined by Section&nbsp;382 and 383, results from transactions increasing ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of the corporation by
	more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. In September 2015, we completed a Section&nbsp;382 analysis through December&nbsp;31, 2014 and determined that there was an ownership change in 2007 that may limit the utilization of
	approximately $5.3&nbsp;million and $5.4&nbsp;million in federal and state NOLs, respectively, and $0.2&nbsp;million in both federal and state research tax credits. Our use of federal NOL carryforwards could be limited further by the provisions of
	Section&nbsp;382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, depending upon the timing and amount of additional equity securities that we have issued or will issue. State NOL carryforwards may be similarly limited. If eliminated, the
	related asset would be removed from the deferred tax asset schedule with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, limitations created by future ownership changes, if any, will not impact
	our effective tax rate.

	interim periods as required by GAAP. These adjustments consist primarily of normal recurring accruals and estimates that impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates. Operating
	results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial

	Since our inception, we have devoted our
	primary effort to raising capital and research and development activities, and at September 30, 2016, have an accumulated deficit of $50.3 million. Through September 30, 2016, all of our financial support has been provided primarily from the sale of
	our common and preferred stock, proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt and funds received under our collaborative research and development agreements. Going forward, as we continue our expansion, we may seek additional financing and/or
	strategic investments. However, there can be no assurance that any additional financing or strategic investments will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If events or circumstances occur such that we do not obtain additional funding,
	we will most likely be required to reduce our plans and/or certain discretionary spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
	statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

	Multiple-Element Revenue Arrangements.

	We evaluate
	deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement to determine whether each deliverable represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customer. If the delivered
	element does not have standalone value without one of the undelivered elements in the arrangement, we combine such elements and account for them as a single unit of accounting. We allocate the consideration to each unit of accounting at the
	inception of the arrangement based on the relative selling price.

	controlled by income tax exempt entities. The Tax Incentive is recognized as a reduction to research and development expense when there is reasonable assurance that the Tax Incentive will be received, the relevant expenditure has been incurred, and
	the amount can be reliably measured. The Tax Incentive is denominated in Australian dollars and, therefore, the related receivable is remeasured into U.S. dollars as of each reporting date.

	expense over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate
	prevesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.

	Net income (loss) per share of common stock is determined using the two-class method for participating securities to

	Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributed to common stockholders by the weighted-average

	(if any) are re-allocated to reflect the potential impact of dilutive securities, including stock options and warrants that reduce the preferred stockholders&#146; participation in earnings to be attributed to common stockholders. Diluted net income
	(loss) per share attributed to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributed to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common equivalent shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In March 2014, we entered into a Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement (TESARO Agreement) with TESARO, Inc. and TESARO Development,
	Inc. (collectively, &#147;TESARO&#148;), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to perform certain discovery and early preclinical development of therapeutic antibodies with the goal of generating
	immunotherapy antibodies for subsequent preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial development to be performed by TESARO. Under the terms of the agreement, TESARO paid an upfront license fee of $17.0 million in March 2014 and agreed to provide
	funding to us for research and development services related to antibody discovery programs for three specific targets. In November 2014, we and TESARO entered into an Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to the Agreement to add an antibody discovery program against
	an undisclosed fourth target for an upfront license fee of $2.0 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For each development program, we are eligible to receive
	milestone payments of up to $18.0 million if certain clinical trial events are achieved by TESARO, up to an additional $90.0 million if certain U.S. and European regulatory submissions and approvals in multiple indications are achieved, and up to an
	additional $165.0 million upon the achievement of specified levels of annual worldwide net sales. We will also be eligible to receive tiered single-digit royalties related to worldwide net sales of products developed under the collaboration and
	certain commercial milestone payments if specified levels of annual worldwide net sales are attained. Unless earlier terminated by either party upon specified circumstances, the agreement will terminate, with respect to each specific developed
	product, upon the later of the 12th anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product or the expiration of the last to expire of any patent. We determined that the upfront license fees and research funding under the agreement, as amended,
	should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and that the upfront license fees should be deferred and recognized as revenue over the same period that the research and development services are performed. In December 2015, we determined that
	the research and development services would be extended through December&nbsp;31, 2016. As a result, the period over which the unrecognized license fees and milestones will be recognized has been extended through December&nbsp;31, 2016.

	$1.7&nbsp;million. The remaining unrecognized milestone payments of $0.3 million at December&nbsp;31, 2015 will be recognized ratably through December&nbsp;2016, for which $0.2 million was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

	In January 2016, TESARO received clearance of their IND from the FDA for an AnaptysBio-generated anti-PD-1 antagonist antibody (TSR-042)
	resulting in us earning a $4.0 million milestone payment. We recognized $3.6 million of the $4.0 million milestone payment as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The remaining unrecognized milestone payment of $0.4&nbsp;million
	at September 30, 2016 will be recognized ratably through December&nbsp;31, 2016. The $4.0 million milestone payment was received in February 2016.

	The costs incurred to issue the Term A Loans of $85,000 were deferred and are included in the

	In connection with the issuance of the Term A Loans, we issued detachable, fully vested warrants to purchase an aggregate of 41,208 shares of

	$0.1 million was recorded as a liability, with a reduction to the carrying value of the Term A Loans, and which is recognized as additional interest expense over the remaining term of the Loans. The initial fair value of the warrants was determined
	using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: a stock price volatility of 70.2%, an expected life equal to the contractual term of the warrants of ten years and a risk-free interest rate of 1.97%.

	(ii)&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2016. If the Term B Loans and Term C Loans are issued, they will bear interest at the greater of 6.95% or the 3-month LIBOR plus 6.72%, with principal payments beginning February&nbsp;1, 2017 and with final maturity in

	Our preferred stock warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and measured at fair value on a recurring

	Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments, including Level 3 instruments, require

	Our Australian subsidiary, which conducts core research and development activities on our behalf, is
	eligible to receive a 45% refundable tax incentive for qualified research and development activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $6.2 million was recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses in the consolidated
	statements of operations, of which $3.0 million related to fiscal 2015. We received the $3.0 million in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In September 2016, we determined that we would meet the criteria for eligibility for fiscal
	2016, therefore we recorded a reduction to research and development expenses of $3.2 million equal to 45% of our eligible expenditures for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, as collectability was considered reasonably assured.

	Promptly after

</I>
	If the indemnification provided

	of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section&nbsp;6(a) or 6(b) above (i)&nbsp;in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other
	from the offering of the Shares or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by clause (i)&nbsp;above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i)&nbsp;above
	but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable
	considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the
	Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
	omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue
	statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this Section&nbsp;6(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably
	incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this Section&nbsp;6(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6(d), no Underwriter shall be required to
	contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been
	required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
	person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters&#146; obligations in this Section&nbsp;6(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the
	Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
	allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section&nbsp;6(d)..

	deemed automatically exercised by the Company as of the 90th day following such termination, provided that the Company may notify Participant that it is exercising its Repurchase Right as of a date prior to such 90th day. Unless Participant is
	otherwise notified by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence that the Company does not intend to exercise its Repurchase Right as to some or all of the Unvested Shares, execution of this Agreement by Participant constitutes written notice to
	Participant of the Company&#146;s intention to exercise its Repurchase Right with respect to all Unvested Shares to which such Repurchase Right applies at the time of termination of Participant&#146;s Service. The Company, at its choice, may satisfy
	its payment obligation to Participant with respect to exercise of the Repurchase Right by (i)&nbsp;delivering a check to Participant in the amount of the purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased, (ii)&nbsp;in the event Participant is
	indebted to the Company, canceling an amount of such indebtedness equal to the purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased (if and to the extent permitted by applicable law), (iii) in the event Participant purchased Unvested Shares
	pursuant to Section 2(c), at the time of termination of Participant&#146;s Service, Participant will forfeit all of Participant&#146;s Unvested Shares or (iv)&nbsp;by a combination of (i)&nbsp;and (ii) so that the combined payment and cancellation
	of indebtedness equals such purchase price. In the event of any deemed automatic exercise of the Repurchase Right by canceling an amount of such indebtedness equal to the purchase price for the Unvested Shares being repurchased, such cancellation of
	indebtedness will be deemed automatically to occur as of the 90th day following termination of Participant&#146;s employment or consulting relationship unless the Company otherwise satisfies its payment obligations. As a result of any repurchase of
	Unvested Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Right, the Company will become the legal and beneficial owner of the Unvested Shares being repurchased and will have all rights and interest therein or related thereto, and the Company will have the right
	to transfer to its own name the number of Unvested Shares being repurchased by the Company, without further action by Participant.

	For purposes of this Agreement, a termination of employment will be determined consistent with the

<B>
<I>
	Company
</I>
</B>
	&#148;) proposes to grant options to purchase shares of Common Stock to eligible employees of the Company and its Participating Corporations pursuant to this Plan. The Company intends this Plan to qualify as an
	&#147;employee stock purchase plan&#148; under Code Section&nbsp;423 (including any amendments to or replacements of such Section), and this Plan shall be so construed. Any term not expressly defined in this Plan but defined for purposes of Code
	Section&nbsp;423 shall have the same definition herein. However, with regard to offers of options for purchase of the Common Stock under the Plan to employees outside the United States working for a Subsidiary or an affiliate of the Company that is
	not a Subsidiary, the Board may offer a subplan or an option that is not intended to meet the Code Section&nbsp;423 requirements, provided, if necessary under Code Section&nbsp;423, that the other terms and conditions of the Plan are met. Subject to
	Section&nbsp;14, a total of Two Hundred Eighteen Thousand (218,000) shares of Common Stock is reserved for issuance under this Plan. In addition, on each January&nbsp;1 for the first ten (10)&nbsp;calendar years after the first Offering Date, the
	aggregate number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be increased automatically by the number of shares equal to one percent (1%) of the total number of outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock on the
	immediately preceding December&nbsp;31 (
<U>
	rounded down to the nearest whole share
</U>
	);
<U>

	, that the Board or the Committee may in its sole discretion reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year; and,
<U>
	provided
	further
</U>
	, that the aggregate number of shares issued over the term of this Plan shall not exceed Two Million One Hundred Eighty Thousand (2,180,000) shares of Common Stock. The number of shares reserved for issuance under this Plan and the
	maximum number of shares that may be issued under this Plan shall be subject to adjustments effected in accordance with Section&nbsp;14 of this Plan. Capitalized terms not defined elsewhere in the text are defined in Section&nbsp;27.

	2. Purpose
</B>
	. The purpose of this Plan is to provide eligible employees of the Company and Participating Corporations with a means of
	acquiring an equity interest in the Company through payroll deductions, to enhance such employees&#146; sense of participation in the affairs of the Company and Participating Corporations, and to provide an incentive for continued employment.

	&#148;). Subject to the provisions of this Plan and the limitations of Section&nbsp;423 of the Code or any successor provision in the Code, all questions of interpretation or application of this Plan shall be
	determined by the Committee and its decisions shall be final and binding upon all Participants. The Committee will have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to determine eligibility and
	decide upon any and all claims filed under the Plan. Every finding, decision and determination made by the Committee will, to the full extent permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
	this Plan, the Committee may adopt rules and/or procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate requirements of local law and procedures outside of the United States. The Committee will have the authority to
	determine the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock (which determination shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes) in accordance with Section&nbsp;8 below and to interpret Section&nbsp;8 of the Plan in connection with circumstances
	that impact the Fair Market Value. Members of the Committee shall receive no compensation for their services in connection with the administration of this Plan, other than standard fees as established from time to time by the Board for services
	rendered by Board members serving on the Board or its committees. All expenses incurred in connection with the administration of this Plan shall be paid by the Company. For purposes of this Plan, the Committee may designate separate offerings under

	9.4. Application of Payments and Proceeds
</B>
	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
	contained in this Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (a)&nbsp;Borrower irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any and all payments at any time or times thereafter received by
	Collateral Agent from or on behalf of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of all or any part of the Obligations, and, as between Borrower on the one hand and Collateral Agent and Lenders on the other, Collateral Agent shall have the continuing and
	exclusive right to apply and to reapply any and all payments received against the Obligations in such manner as Collateral Agent may deem advisable notwithstanding any previous application by Collateral Agent, and (b)&nbsp;the proceeds of any sale
	of, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied: first, to the Lenders&#146; Expenses; second, to accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations (including any interest which, but for the provisions of the United
	States Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such amounts); third, to the principal amount of the Obligations outstanding; and fourth, to any other indebtedness or obligations of Borrower owing to Collateral Agent or any Lender under the Loan
	Documents. Any balance remaining shall be delivered to Borrower or to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such balance or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. In carrying out the foregoing, (x)&nbsp;amounts received shall be
	applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to the application to the next succeeding category, and (y)&nbsp;each of the Persons entitled to receive a payment in any particular category shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata
	share of amounts available to be applied pursuant thereto for such category. Any reference in this Agreement to an allocation between or sharing by the Lenders of any right, interest or obligation &#147;ratably,&#148; &#147;proportionally&#148; or
	in similar terms shall refer to Pro Rata Share unless expressly provided otherwise. Collateral Agent, or if applicable, each Lender, shall promptly remit to the other Lenders such sums as may be necessary to ensure the ratable repayment of each
	Lender&#146;s portion of any Term Loan and the ratable distribution of interest, fees and reimbursements paid or made by Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender receiving a scheduled payment shall not be responsible for determining whether
	the other Lenders also received their scheduled payment on such date; provided, however, if it is later determined that a Lender received more than its ratable share of scheduled payments made on any date or dates, then such Lender shall remit to
	Collateral Agent or other Lenders such sums as may be necessary to ensure the ratable payment of such scheduled payments, as instructed by Collateral Agent. If any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, properties or
	securities, shall be received by a Lender in excess of its ratable share, then the portion of such payment or distribution in excess of such Lender&#146;s ratable share shall be received by such Lender in trust for and shall be promptly paid over to
	the other Lender for application to the payments of amounts due on the other Lenders&#146; claims. To the extent any payment for the account of Borrower is required to be returned as a voidable transfer or otherwise, the Lenders shall contribute to
	one another as is necessary to ensure that such return of payment is on a pro rata basis. If any Lender shall obtain possession of any Collateral, it shall hold such Collateral for itself and as agent and bailee for Collateral Agent and other
	Lenders for purposes of perfecting Collateral Agent&#146;s security interest therein.

	responsible for: (a)&nbsp;the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b)&nbsp;any loss or damage to the Collateral; (c)&nbsp;any diminution in the value of the Collateral; or (d)&nbsp;any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, or other Person.

	9.6. No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative

	. Failure by
	Collateral Agent or any Lender, at any time or times, to require strict performance by Borrower of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not waive, affect, or diminish any right of Collateral Agent or any Lender thereafter
	to demand strict performance and compliance herewith or therewith. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless signed by Collateral Agent and the Required Lenders and then is only effective for the specific instance and purpose for which it is
	given. The rights and remedies of Collateral Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative. Collateral Agent and the Lenders have all rights and remedies provided under the Code, any applicable law, by law,
	or in equity. The exercise by Collateral Agent or any Lender of one right or remedy is not an election, and Collateral Agent&#146;s or any Lender&#146;s waiver of any Event of Default is not a continuing waiver. Collateral Agent&#146;s or any
	Lender&#146;s delay in exercising any remedy is not a waiver, election, or acquiescence.

	any promissory notes), chattel paper (whether tangible or electronic), cash, deposit accounts and other Collateral Accounts, all certificates of deposit, fixtures, letters of credit rights (whether or not the letter of credit is evidenced by a

	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral does not include (i)&nbsp;any Intellectual Property; provided, however, the Collateral shall
	include all Accounts and all proceeds of Intellectual Property; provided that if a judicial authority (including a U.S. Bankruptcy Court) would hold that a security interest in the underlying Intellectual Property is necessary to have a security
	interest in such Accounts and such property that are proceeds of Intellectual Property, then the Collateral shall automatically, and effective as of the Effective Date, include the Intellectual Property to the extent necessary to permit perfection
	of Collateral Agent&#146;s security interest in such Accounts and such other property of Borrower that are proceeds of the Intellectual Property; (ii)&nbsp;more than sixty five percent (65%)&nbsp;of the total combined voting power of all classes of
	stock entitled to vote the shares of capital stock of any Foreign Subsidiary (excluding Anaptys Australia), if Borrower demonstrates to Collateral Agent&#146;s reasonable satisfaction that a pledge of more than sixty five percent (65%)&nbsp;of the
	Shares of such Subsidiary creates a present and existing adverse tax consequence to Borrower under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; and (iii)&nbsp;any (x)&nbsp;inbound licenses of Intellectual Property in which Borrower is the licensee; or
	(y)&nbsp;real estate leasehold interests in which Borrower is the lessee; in each case of (x)&nbsp;and (y), to the extent the grant of a security interest with respect to such property would be prohibited by the agreement with the non-Borrower party
	or would otherwise constitute a default thereunder, provided that such property will automatically be deemed to be &#147;Collateral&#148; hereunder if such prohibition is unenforceable or ineffective and/or upon the termination, lapsing or
