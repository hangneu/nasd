	read thoroughly this annual report and the documents that we refer to with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from and worse than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these
	cautionary statements.

	Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In evaluating our business, we consider and use the following non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating
	performance: adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted net profit and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial
	information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted gross profit as gross profit excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization expenses of intangible assets derived from acquisitions. We define adjusted
	operating expenses as operating income (expenses) excluding share-based compensation expenses, changes in the fair value of contingent purchase consideration payable and operating income. We define adjusted net profit as net (loss) profit from
	continuing operations excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization expenses of intangible assets derived from acquisitions, changes in the fair value of contingent purchase consideration payable and loss on debt extinguishment. We
	define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding share-based compensation expenses, changes in the fair value of contingent purchase consideration payable and loss on debt extinguishment, and EBITDA as net profit (loss) from continuing operations before
	income tax expense (benefit), foreign exchange gain (loss), other expenses, other income, interest expense, interest income and depreciation and amortization.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The non-GAAP financial measure disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S.
	GAAP. You should carefully evaluate the financial results we have reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measure used by us may be prepared differently from and, therefore,
	may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that the use of these non-GAAP measures
	facilitates investors&#146; assessment of our operating performance from period to period and from company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in items such as capital structures (affecting relative interest
	expenses), the book amortization of intangibles (affecting relative amortization expenses), the age and book value of property and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expenses) and other non-cash expenses (affecting share-based compensation
	expenses). We also present these non-GAAP measures because we believe these non-GAAP measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as measures of the financial performance of companies in our industry.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These
	non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data
	prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations include, but are not limited to:

	December&nbsp;31, 2015. We make no representation that any RMB or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate, or at all. The PRC government imposes control over
	its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of RMB into foreign exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade. On April 8, 2016, the noon buying rate was RMB6.4628 to US$1.00.

	Our business depends on our relationships with China Telecom and China Unicom, two major telecommunications carriers in China, for

	with power systems, cabling and wiring and other data center equipment pre-installed. Because each local subsidiary of China Telecom or China Unicom has independent authority and budget to enter into contracts, our contract terms with these
	subsidiaries vary and are determined on a case-by-case basis. We generally define &#147;partnered&#148; data centers as the data center space and cabinets we leased from China Telecom, China Unicom and other third parties through agreements. Based
	on the specific requests of our customers, demands in different cities and our strategy for points of presence, or POP, establishment, the locations and number of our partnered data centers may change from time to time. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015,
	we leased a total of 7,558 cabinets that are housed in our 69 partnered data centers, accounting for 32.1% of the total number of our cabinets under management. If we are not able to secure sufficient cabinets from China Unicom and China Telecom, it
	will have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and results of operations. We also rely on China Telecom and China Unicom for a significant portion of our bandwidth needs and lease optical fibers from them to connect our data centers
	with each other and with the telecommunications backbones and other internet service providers, or ISPs. Our agreements with local subsidiaries of China Telecom or China Unicom usually have a one-year term with automatic renewal option. In addition,
	China Telecom and China Unicom also provide data center services and directly compete with us for customers. See &#147;&#151;We may not be able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors.&#148; We believe that we have good

	The global macroeconomic environment is facing challenges, including the escalation of the
	European sovereign debt crisis since 2011, the end of quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the economic slowdown in the Eurozone in 2014. Our business and operations are primarily based in China and most of our revenues are derived
	from our operations in China. Accordingly, our financial results have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by the economy and data center services industry in China. Although the economy in China has grown significantly in the past
	decades, it still faces challenges. The Chinese economy has slowed down in recent years. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, China&#146;s gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to 6.9% in 2015. There is considerable
	uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world&#146;s leading economies, including the United States and China. There have been
	concerns over unrest and terrorist threats in the Middle East and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in oil and other markets, and over the conflicts involving Ukraine and Syria. There have also been concerns on the relationship among China
	and other Asian countries, which may result in or intensify potential conflicts in relation to territorial disputes. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political
	policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Any prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and continued turbulence
	in the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.

	negatively impacted. Our sales cycle could also be lengthened if customers slow spending, or delay decision-making, on our products and services, which could adversely affect our revenues growth and our ability to recognize revenue. Finally, we
	could also experience pricing pressure as a result of economic conditions if our competitors lower prices and attempt to lure away our customers with lower cost solutions. Finally, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted

	but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by governmental control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. In

	The overall effect of legislation over the past several decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently

	The Ministry of Commerce, or MOC, published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015 aiming to, upon its
	enactment, replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise
	Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The draft Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international
	practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. The MOC is currently soliciting comments on this draft and substantial uncertainties exist with respect to its enactment
	timetable, interpretation and implementation. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as proposed, may materially impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations in many aspects.

	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &#147;actual
	control&#148; in determining whether a company should be treated as an FIE. According to the definition set forth in the draft Foreign Investment Law, FIEs refer to enterprises established in China pursuant to PRC law that are solely or partially
	invested by foreign investors. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities established in China (without direct foreign equity ownership) but &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors, through contract or trust for
	example, will be treated as FIEs. Once an entity falls within the definition of FIE, it may be subject to foreign investment &#147;restrictions&#148; or &#147;prohibitions&#148; set forth in a &#147;negative list&#148; to be separately issued by the
	State Council later. If an FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry subject to foreign investment &#147;restrictions&#148; in the &#147;negative list,&#148; the FIE must go through a market entry clearance by the MOC before being established.
	If an FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry subject to foreign investment &#147;prohibitions&#148; in the &#147;negative list,&#148; it must not engage in the business. However, an FIE, during the market entry clearance process, may apply
	in writing to be treated as a PRC domestic enterprise if its foreign investor(s) is/are ultimately &#147;controlled&#148; by PRC government authorities and its affiliates and/or PRC citizens. In this connection, &#147;control&#148; is broadly
	defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i) holding 50% of more of the voting rights of the subject entity; (ii) holding less than 50% of the voting rights of the subject entity but having the power to secure at least
	50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power to exert material influence on the board, the shareholders&#146; meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii) having the power to
	exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&#146;s operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business operations.

	The &#147;variable interest entity&#148; structure, or VIE structure, has been adopted by many PRC-based companies, including us, to obtain
	necessary licenses and permits in the industries that are currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in China. See &#147;&#151;Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure&#148; and Item 4.C&#151;&#147;Organizational Structure.&#148; Under the
	draft Foreign Investment Law, variable interest entities that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors. Therefore, for any companies with a VIE
	structure in an industry category that is on the &#147;negative list,&#148; the VIE structure may be deemed legitimate only if the ultimate controlling person(s) is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC companies or PRC citizens). Conversely, if the

	Investment Law and substantial uncertainties exist with respect to its enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the industry of data center and providing value-added telecommunication services, in
	which our variable interest entities operate, will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in the &#147;negative list&#148; to be issued. If the enacted version of the Foreign Investment Law and the final

	We believe such pilot schemes represent the current administration&#146;s continuous efforts in
	carrying out the recent policies of the PRC State Council and MIIT regarding encouraging private sectors to further participate in the telecommunication industry. The Broadband Notice specifically mentioned that the broadband access business is a
	basic telecommunication business. The Pilot Work Notice also specifically mentioned that the mobile network resale business, which we believe shares something in common with our managed network services, is a second-category basic telecommunication
	business rather than a value-added telecommunication business. These pilot schemes, to some extent, reflect a legislative trend to welcome private enterprises (in comparison to the state-owned enterprise) to participate in basic telecommunication
	businesses in the soon future. Nevertheless, although we believe these pilot schemes are not a practical change or modification to the current legal framework which our managed network service business might be subject to and only represent a
	legislative trend to open up the basic telecommunication business market to the private enterprises, new laws, regulations or government interpretations may also be promulgated from time to time to regulate the hosting service and managed network

	Pursuant to the New PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law,
	or New EIT Law, and its implementation rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008, an enterprise established outside of China with &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; within China is considered a &#147;resident enterprise,&#148; meaning
	that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax, or EIT, purposes. Under the implementation rules of New EIT Law, the term &#147;de facto management body&#148; is defined as the management body that
	exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Regarding the Determination
	of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, which is amended and supplemented by the Announcement Regarding the Determination of PRC Tax Resident
	Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies issued by the State Administration of Taxation on January 29, 2014. Circular 82 and its amendments sets out certain specific criteria and process for determining whether the &#147;de facto
	management body&#148; of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise is located in China. Given that the New EIT Law and its implementation rules are relatively new and ambiguous in terms of some definitions, requirements and detailed
	procedures, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.

	On February 3, 2015, the State Administration of Tax issued the Notice
	on Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfers of Properties by Non-Resident Enterprises, or Circular 7. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its
	tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides
	clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings
	challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an &#147;indirect transfer&#148; by transferring the taxable assets
	indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority
	such indirect transfer. Using a &#147;substance over form&#148; principle, the PRC tax authority may re-characterize such indirect transfer as a direct transfer of the equity interests in the PRC tax resident enterprise and other properties in
	China. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate
	of up to 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the transferee may be subject to penalties under PRC tax laws if the transferee fails to withhold the taxes and the transferor fails to pay the
	taxes.

	The M&amp;A Rules and other
	recently adopted regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. In addition, the
	Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on the Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises, issued by the MOC in August 2011, specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors involved in &#147;an industry
	related to national security&#148; are subject to strict review by the MOC, and prohibit any activities attempting to bypass such security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. We
	believe that our business is not in an industry related to national security, but we cannot preclude the possibility that the MOC or other government agencies may publish explanations contrary to our understanding or broaden the scope of such
	security reviews in the future, in which case our future acquisitions in the PRC, including those by way of entering into contractual control arrangements with target entities, may be closely scrutinized or prohibited. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly
	Law requires that the MOC be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain filing thresholds are triggered. Part of our growth strategy includes acquiring complementary businesses or assets in China. Complying with the
	requirements of the laws and regulations mentioned above and other PRC regulations to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOC, may delay or inhibit our
	ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. If any of our acquisitions were subject to the M&amp;A Rule and were found not to be in compliance with the requirements of
	the M&amp;A Rule in the future, relevant PRC regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business,
	financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.

	obtaining specific approvals from, or completing specific registrations or filings with, the relevant authorities on a case-by-case basis and is subject to a strict monitoring system. Regulations in the PRC on the remittance of Renminbi into the PRC
	for settlement of capital account items are developing gradually. Currently, our PRC subsidiaries may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the
	SAFE. However, foreign exchange transactions by our PRC subsidiaries under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with PRC governmental authorities,
	including the SAFE. In particular, if our PRC subsidiaries borrow foreign currency loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must first be registered with the SAFE. If any of our PRC subsidiaries, which are wholly foreign-owned
	enterprises, borrows foreign currency, the accumulative amount of its foreign currency loans may not exceed the difference between the total investment and the registered capital of that PRC subsidiary. If we finance our PRC subsidiaries by means of
	additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities, including the National Development and Reform Commission, the MOC or their respective local counterparts. Any existing and future
	restrictions on currency exchange may affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries or affiliated entities to obtain foreign currencies, limit our ability to meet our foreign currency obligations or otherwise materially and adversely affect our

	The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People&#146;s Bank of
	China. The PRC government allowed the Renminbi to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation was halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the
	U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. As a consequence, the Renminbi fluctuated significantly during that period against other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. Since June 2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S.
	dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As our costs and expenses are mostly denominated in RMB, the appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would increase our costs in U.S.
	dollar terms. In addition, as our operating subsidiaries and VIEs in China receive revenues in RMB, any significant depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may have a material and adverse effect on our revenues in U.S. dollar terms and
	financial condition, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ordinary shares. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for capital expenditures and working capital and other business purposes,
	appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for
	dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs, strategic acquisitions or investments or other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. These and other
	effects on our financial data resulting from fluctuations in the value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our ADSs and your investment. See &#147;Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative

	Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, issued by SAFE on July 4, 2014. According to Circular 37, PRC residents are required to register with local SAFE branches in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore
	entity for the purposes of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents&#146; legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in Circular 37 as a &#147;special purpose
	vehicle.&#148; The term &#147;control&#148; under Circular 37 is broadly defined as the operation rights, beneficiary rights or decision-making rights acquired by the PRC residents in the offshore special purpose vehicles or PRC companies by such
	means as acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any changes with respect to the basic information of the special
	purpose vehicle, such as changes in a PRC resident individual shareholder, name or operation period; or any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals,
	share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. If the shareholders of the offshore holding company who are PRC residents do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited
	from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and the offshore company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries.
	Moreover, failure to comply with SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. On February 13, 2015, SAFE promulgated a Notice on Further
	Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015. SAFE Notice 13 has delegated to the qualified banks the authority to register all PRC residents&#146;

	prices of their securities. The trading performances of other Chinese companies&#146; securities after their offerings may affect the attitudes of investors toward Chinese companies listed in the United States, which consequently may impact the

	foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to ambiguity in several respects and, in addition, we must make a separate determination each year as to whether we are a PFIC (after the close of each taxable year).

	(ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income, or the asset test. While we do not anticipate being a PFIC, changes in the nature
	of our income or assets or the value of our assets may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or any subsequent taxable year. Under circumstances where revenues from activities that produce passive income significantly increase relative to our

	As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 4,000 enterprise customers for our hosting services, among which 37 were local subsidiaries of a

	procurement budget, we count each of them as a separate customer. None of these telecommunication carrier customers on a stand-alone basis contributed more than 2% of our revenues in any given year but in the aggregate, they contributed 16%, 7% and

	. We face competition from state-owned telecommunication carriers, including China Telecom and China Unicom. According to IDC, carriers occupied 45.6% of the data center services market in 2014. In
	addition, both carriers operate their own networks. Competition is primarily focused on pricing, quality of services and geographic coverage. We believe we are well-positioned to compete with major carriers. Unlike China Telecom and China Unicom,
	which construct data centers primarily to help sell bandwidth, we provide connectivity to multiple networks in each of our carrier-neutral data centers, providing superior choice and performance. Our private network provides enhanced connectivity
	among different networks. In comparison, data centers operated by China Telecom and China Unicom generally provide access only to their own network and are often constrained by their networks&#146; coverage. Due to inadequate interconnectivity among
	China&#146;s carriers&#146; networks and among the same carrier&#146;s networks in different provinces, interconnectivity bottlenecks remain a major problem, contributing to slow transmission speeds across services and applications.

	telecommunications services are defined as telecommunications and information services provided through public networks. A &#147;Catalog of Telecommunications Business&#148; or the Catalog, was issued as an attachment to the Telecom Regulations to

	primarily provided to enterprise users, closely attached to basic infrastructure and telecom resources, and have significant importance to national information security and public order, are categorized as type I value-added telecommunications

	We believe such pilot schemes represent the current

	mentioned that the broadband access business is a basic telecommunication business. The Pilot Work Notice also specifically mentioned that the mobile network resale business, which we believe shares something in common with our managed network
	services, is a second-category basic telecommunication business rather than a value-added telecommunication business. These pilot schemes, to some extent, reflect a legislative trend to welcome private enterprises (in comparison to the state-owned
	enterprise) to participate in basic telecommunication businesses in the soon future. Nevertheless, although we believe these pilot schemes are not a practical change or modification to the current legal framework which our managed network service
	business might be subject to and only represent a legislative trend to open up the basic telecommunication business market to the private enterprises, new laws, regulations or government interpretations may also be promulgated from time to time to
	regulate the hosting service and managed network service or any of our related technology or services, which may require us to obtain additional, or expand existing, operating licenses or permits. Any of these factors could result in our
	disqualification from carrying out our current business, causing significant disruption to our business operations which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will be closely monitoring

	Pursuant to applicable PRC regulations on foreign currency exchange, Renminbi is freely convertible only to the extent of current account
	items, such as trade-related receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require the prior approval from the SAFE or its local branch for conversion
	of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars. Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Domestic companies or individuals can repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad, or deposit
	these payments abroad subject to the requirement that such payments shall be repatriated within a certain period of time. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks. Foreign currencies
	received for current account items can be either retained or sold to financial institutions that have foreign exchange settlement or sales business without prior approval from the SAFE, subject to certain regulations. Foreign exchange income under

	In addition, the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of
	Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular No. 142, issued by the SAFE on August 29, 2008, regulates the conversion by FIEs of foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. SAFE
	Circular 142 requires that Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of an FIE may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the relevant government authority and may not be used to make equity
	investments in PRC, unless specifically provided otherwise. The SAFE further strengthened its oversight over the flow and use of Renminbi funds converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of an FIE. The use of such Renminbi may not be
	changed without approval from the SAFE, and may not be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. Any violation of SAFE Circular 142 may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines. The Notice on
	the Reform of Administration of Foreign Currency Capital Settlement by Foreign Investment Enterprises in Several Experimental Areas issued by the SAFE on July&nbsp;4, 2014 lifted certain restrictions on the usage of Renminbi converted from the
	foreign currency-denominated capital, by allowing FIEs to make equity investments in PRC in certain experimental areas with converted Renminbi after making registration with the local SAFE branch.

	We are a leading carrier-neutral internet data center services provider in China. We host our customers&#146; servers and networking equipment
	and provide interconnectivity to improve the performance, availability and security of their internet infrastructure. We also provide managed network services to enable customers to deliver data across the internet in a faster and more reliable
	manner through our extensive data transmission network and our proprietary smart routing technology. Furthermore, we provide complementary value-added services, such as CDN services, VPN services and last-time wired broadband services to improve the
	security, speed and quality of data transmission in China. We started offering public cloud services in 2013 and private cloud and hybrid services in 2014. We believe that the scale of our data center and networking assets as well as our
	carrier-neutrality position us well to capture opportunities and become a leader in the rapidly emerging market for cloud computing infrastructure services in China.

	We have benefited from our premium data centers and extensive interconnected nationwide data transmission network, diversified and loyal
	customer base and our strong focus on customer satisfaction and technological innovation. Going forward, we expect that we will continue to benefit from the growth of China&#146;s data center services market. However, we also face risks and
	uncertainties, including those relating to our ability to successfully implement our expansion plan, our integration of newly acquired businesses, our competition with, and dependency on, China Telecom and China Unicom, our ability to attract new
	customers and retain existing customers and our ability to control costs as a result of being a public company. In particular, we plan to significantly increase the aggregate number of cabinets under our management at both of our new self-built data

	Our business and results of operations are generally affected by the development of China&#146;s data center
	services market. We have benefited from the rapid growth of China&#146;s data center services market during the recent years. According to IDC, the total China internet data center services market was US$3.4 billion in 2014, a 36.9% year over year
	growth rate, and is expected to reach US$11.8 billion in 2019, representing a five-year CAGR of 27.9%. However, any adverse changes in the data center services market in China may harm our business and results of operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While our business is influenced by factors affecting the data center services market in China generally, we believe that our results of
	operations are more directly affected by company-specific factors, including number of cabinets under management and cabinet utilization rate, monthly recurring revenues and churn rate, pricing, growth in complementary markets and optimization of
	our managed network services and our cost structure.

</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our revenues are directly affected by the number of cabinets under management and the utilization rates of these cabinet spaces. We had 14,041,
	21,522 and 23,556 cabinets under management as of December&nbsp;31 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our annualized average monthly cabinet utilization rates were 70.8%, 71.9% and 69.0% in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We calculate the
	annualized cabinet utilization rate in a year as the average of the four quarterly cabinet utilization rates in that year, and we calculated quarterly cabinet utilization rate by dividing our weighted average billable cabinets by weighted average
	cabinet capacity in that quarter. Our quarterly and annualized cabinet utilization rates fluctuate due to the continuous changes in both our weighted average billable cabinets and weighted average cabinet capacity. Our future results of operations
	and growth prospects will largely depend on our ability to increase the number of cabinets under management while maintaining optimal cabinet utilization rate. With the rapid growth of China&#146;s internet industry, demand for cabinet spaces has
	increased significantly and we do not always have sufficient self-built capacity to meet such demand. It usually takes twelve to eighteen months to build a data center together with cabinets and equipment installed. To meet our customers&#146;
	immediate demand, we may partner with China Telecom, China Unicom or other parties and lease cabinets from them. Due to the time needed to build data centers and the long-term nature of these investments, if we over-estimate the market demand for
	cabinets, it will lower our cabinet utilization rate and negatively affect our results of operations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our average monthly recurring revenues and churn rate directly affect our results of operations. Our business is based on a recurring revenue
	model comprised of hosting services and managed network services. We consider these services recurring as our customers are generally billed and revenue recognized on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which
	is generally one year in length. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of fees charged for installation services, additional bandwidth used by customers beyond contracted amount and other value-added services. These services are
	considered to be non-recurring as they are billed and recognized over the period of the customer service agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We use &#147;monthly
	recurring revenues&#148; to measure those revenues recognized on a fixed and recurring basis each month. Recurring revenues have comprised more than 85% of our total revenues during the past three years. Our average monthly recurring revenues
	increased from RMB146.6 million in 2013 to RMB208.4 million in 2014 and to RMB265.4 million (US$41.0 million) in 2015.

	We use &#147;churn
	rate&#148; to measure the reduction of monthly revenues as a percentage of total monthly recurring revenues of the previous month that are attributable to the non-renewal or termination of customer contracts. Our average monthly churn rate as
	measured by monthly recurring revenues was 1.7% in 2013. We started to use &#147;hosting churn rate&#148; in 2014 which we believe more accurately reflect our core IDC business and is also more commonly used by our peers in the data center industry
	in more advanced economies. Our average monthly hosting churn rate, based on our core IDC business, was 0.6% in 2014 and 0.2% in 2015.

	mission critical servers and equipment in our data centers, but not the bulk of their needs. As we try to acquire more business from new and existing customers, expand into new markets, or try to adapt to changing market conditions, we may need to

	expect continued growth in this market to meet customers&#146; growing demand for enterprise-grade VPN services with secure, dedicated connections. Key growth drivers include adding new
	customers, adding number of connections with existing customers and revenue synergies with our other business groups. Going forward, we will continue to leverage cross-selling opportunities to strengthen Dermot Entities&#146;s position as the
	leading VPN services provider in the greater China Region.

	Optimization of Managed Network Services

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our results of operations also depend on the optimization of our managed network services as we continue to fine-tune our strategies in this
	business. We started offering managed network services in 2008 and revenues derived from managed network services constituted 36.0%, 31.1% and 25.5% of our total net revenues in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our revenues from managed network
	services have increased from RMB707.5 million in 2013 to RMB895.8 million in 2014 and to RMB926.9 million (US$143.1 million) in 2015. Historically, we have acquired 100% equity interest in the Managed Network Entities, Gehua, WiFire BJ and
	BJ&nbsp;Yilong, and 50% of equity interests plus one share in Aipu Group, that are complementary to our managed network services. We believe our managed network services will benefit from the growing market demand for faster data transmission and
	better interconnection and continue to serve as part of our competitive strengths as a comprehensive internet infrastructure service provider.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect that our managed network service business likely will be a relatively more volatile portion of our overall revenue base. As the
	managed network services market continues to evolve and as we further optimize our growth strategies and allocate resources to more attractive areas with higher growth and return rates, we may become more selective in pursuing future revenue
	opportunities in the managed network services business. In addition, we have experienced pricing pressure for our managed network services in recent years and we expect that this trend may continue. Therefore, revenues from managed network services
	could experience decline both in the absolute amount and as a percentage of our consolidated revenues, which could have a negative impact on our overall growth and profitability.

	Our Cost Structure
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our ability to
	maintain and improve our gross margins depends on our ability to effectively manage our cost of revenues, which consist of telecommunications costs and other data center related costs. Telecommunications costs refer to expenses associated with
	acquiring bandwidth and related resources from carriers for our data centers. Telecommunications costs also cover rentals, utilities and other costs in connection with the cabinets we lease from our partnered data centers. Other costs include
	utilities and rental expenses for our self-built data centers, payroll, depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment, and other related costs. These costs increase as the number of our cabinets under management increases, likewise as
	we increase our headcount.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The mix of the self-built data centers and partnered data centers also affects our cost structure. Gross
	margin for cabinets located in our partnered data centers is generally lower than cabinets located in our self-built data centers. This is because telecommunication carriers who lease cabinet spaces to us for our partnered data centers would demand
	a profit on top of their costs in connection with the leasing of cabinet spaces to us. We plan to continue to lease data centers from such carriers or purchase data center facilities to meet the immediate market demand while building new or
	expanding existing data centers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Xi&#146;an, Suzhou and the Greater Guangzhou area. If we cannot effectively manage the market demand and increase the number of cabinets located in
	self-built data centers relatively to partnered data centers, we may not be able to improve our gross margins.

	Telecommunications costs refer to expenses incurred in acquiring telecommunication resources from
	carriers for our data centers, including bandwidth and cabinet leasing costs. Cabinet leasing costs cover rentals, utilities and other costs associated with the cabinets we lease from our partnered data centers. Our other costs of revenues include
	utilities costs for our self-built data centers, depreciation and amortization, payroll and other compensation costs and other miscellaneous items related to our service offerings.

	We expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase as our business expands, both organically and as a result of acquisitions.
	Additionally, we anticipate recording significant expenses related to the amortization of the intangible assets that we have acquired through acquisitions as these intangible assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives.

	The performance of the impairment test in accordance to ASC 350 involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves

	unit&#146;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired. If this occurs, the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss.

	In 2015, we have elected to assess goodwill for impairment using the two-step process.
	As of October 1, 2015, we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill that has arisen out of our acquisitions. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach based on the discounted expected cash flows associated
	with the reporting unit. The discounted cash flows for the reporting unit were based on six year projections. Cash flow projections were based on past experience, actual operating results and management best estimates about future developments as
	well as certain market assumptions. Cash flows after six years were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which considered terminal value growth at 3%, considering the long term revenue growth for entities in a similar industry in the PRC.
	The discount rate of approximately 13% was derived and used in the valuations which reflect the market assessment of the risks specific to us and our industry and is based on its weighted average cost of capital. The resulting fair value of the
	reporting unit was higher than its carrying value, and as such, we were not required to complete the second step; therefore, no impairment losses were recognized in 2015. Similarly, pursuant to the same goodwill impairment tests in 2013 and 2014, no

	We evaluate our long-lived assets or asset group, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in
	circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a group of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When these events occur, we
	evaluate for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flow is less than
	the carrying amount of the assets, we would recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the cash flows expected to be generated by
	the assets, when the market prices are not readily available for the long-lived assets. No impairment charge was recognized for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015.

	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
<I>
	Leases
</I>
	(&#147;ASU 2016-02&#148;). ASU
	2016-02 specifies the accounting for leases. For operating leases, ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The
	standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting
	periods and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.

	In the last 3 years, inflation
	in China has not materially impacted our results of operations. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the annual average percent changes in the consumer price index in China for 2013, 2014 and 2015 were 2.6%, 2.0% and 1.4%,
	respectively. The year-over-year percent changes in the consumer price index for January 2014, 2015 and 2016 were increases of 2.5%, 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we cannot
	assure you that we will not be affected in the future by higher rates of inflation in China.

	Our net revenues increased

	recurring revenues increased by 27.4% to RMB265.4 million (US$41.0 million) in 2015 from RMB208.4 million in 2014. Revenues from our hosting and related services amounted to RMB2,707.4 million (US$418.0 million) in 2015, increasing by 36.7% from
	RMB1,980.7 million in 2014. The increase in revenues from our hosting and related services was primarily due to (i) the growth in demand for our cloud business, (ii) contribution from acquired companies and (iii) the increase in the total number of
	billable cabinets under our management in both our self-built and partnered data centers, which was attributable to growing customer demand. The number of cabinets under our management increased from 21,522 as of December 31, 2014 to 23,556 as of

	acquired companies, which was partially offset by industry-wide decline in bandwith prices. The decrease in percentage was due to the significant increase of the total net revenues.

	cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in telecommunication costs, as well as other costs due to higher depreciation expenses from our self-built data centers. Additionally, amortization expense of intangible assets derived from

	We have entered into long-term bank borrowing arrangements since 2013 with maturity terms of two
	to five years. The long-term bank borrowing (including current portion) outstanding as of December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 bore weighted-average interest rates of 7.12%, 6.00% and 6.59% per annum, respectively, in 2013, 2014 and 2015 and have
	certain financial covenants. We have incurred other long-term borrowings in 2013 with a two-year term and interest rate of 4.00% per annum and a principal amount of RMB900 million, which were paid off on time. We also have a contractual obligation
	to purchase the 10% noncontrolling interest in Asia Cloud Investment from Dongguan Dongcai at the end of five years from the establishment of Asia Cloud Investment in July 2013 at a consideration equivalent to the higher of the then fair value and
	the investment costs of RMB100 million. Dongguan Dongcai is entitled to a cumulative dividend at 8.00% per annum for its capital contribution of RMB100 million in Asia Cloud Investment.

	In March 2013, we issued the 2016 Bonds with RMB1 billion in aggregate principal amount due in March 2016 with a coupon rate of 7.875% per
	annum and an effective interest rate of 9.29% per annum. Interest on the 2016 Bonds is payable semi-annually in arrears on, or nearest to, March&nbsp;22 and September&nbsp;22 in each year, beginning on September 22, 2013. The 2016 Bonds were fully

	In June 2014, we issued the 2017 Bonds with RMB2 billion in aggregate principal amount due in June 2017 with a
	coupon rate of 6.875% per annum and an effective interest rate of 7.39% per annum. Interest on the 2017 Bonds is payable semi-annually in arrears on, or nearest to, June&nbsp;26 and December&nbsp;26 in each year, beginning on December 26, 2014. We
	used a portion of the proceeds to purchase, pursuant to a tender offer, substantially all the 2016 Bonds, with only RMB264.3 million of the principal amount of the 2016 Bonds outstanding by then.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The 2017 Bonds have (i) restrictive covenant that restricts our ability in consolidation, merger and sale of assets to a certain extent; (ii)
	negative pledge covenant that restricts our ability to create security to secure bonds, notes, debentures or other securities that are quoted, listed or dealt in or traded on securities market on our undertaking, assets or revenues; (iii) dividend
	payment restriction covenant; and (iv) covenant relating to the ratio of our Adjusted EBITDA to our Consolidated Interest Expense (interest expense paid net of interest income received). Such covenants may limit our ability to undertake additional
	debt financing, but not equity financing. As of the date of this annual report, the Company is in compliance with all the covenants under the 2017 Bonds. Breach of covenants under the 2017 Bonds will trigger acceleration of the 2017 Bonds, the
	principal amount together with accrued interest shall become immediately due and payable. When such breach of covenants occurs, our assets and cash flows may not be sufficient to repay the 2017 Bonds, or we may not be able to find alternative
	financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, such financing may not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#151;If we
	are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants contained in our debt agreements, an event of default could occur under the terms of such agreements, which could cause repayment of such debt to be accelerated.&#148;

	We have unused credit line in the amount of RMB414.0 million (US$63.9 million) as of December 31, 2015, pursuant to credit agreements entered
	into with eight banks. A total of RMB620.0 million (US$95.7 million) credit line was granted to us under eight credit agreements, of which we have used RMB206.0 million (US$31.8 million). There are no material covenants that restrict our ability to
	undertake additional financing associated with the used credit line. No terms and conditions of the unused credit line are available yet because utilization of such unused portion requires approval by the banks and separate loan agreements setting
	forth detailed terms and conditions will only be entered into with the banks upon utilization. We believe the working capital as of December 31, 2015 is sufficient for our present requirements.

	the amount of outstanding debt inside and outside of the PRC was RMB418.2 million (US$64.6 million) and RMB2,264.3 million (US$349.5 million), respectively. We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet both of our onshore and offshore

	similar commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of third parties. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and time deposits, our cash flow from operations and proceeds from our financing activities will be sufficient to meet our
	anticipated cash needs, including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures, for the next 12 months. If we have additional liquidity needs in the future, we may obtain additional financing, including equity offering and debt

	As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash
	and short-term investments was RMB2,113.7 million (US$326.3 million), of which RMB629.4 million (US$97.2 million), RMB286.9 million (US$44.3 million) and RMB1,197.4 million (US$184.8 million) was held by our consolidated affiliated entities, PRC
	subsidiaries and offshore subsidiaries, respectively. Cash transfers from our PRC subsidiaries to our subsidiaries outside of China are subject to PRC government control of currency conversion. Restrictions on the availability of foreign currency
	may affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. See &#147;Item 3.
	Key Information D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#151;Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to receive and utilize our revenues effectively.&#148; The major cost that would be incurred to
	distribute dividends is the withholding tax imposed on the dividends distributed by our PRC operating subsidiaries at the rate of 10% or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty, if any.

	Under Cayman Islands law, our directors have a fiduciary duty to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to our best interests. Our
	directors also owe to our company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his
	knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. In fulfilling their duty of
	care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association as amended and restated from time to time. Our Company has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached.

	Under the New EIT Law, an enterprise established under the laws of foreign countries or regions and whose &#147;place of effective
	management&#148; is located within the PRC are considered PRC tax resident enterprises and subject to PRC income tax at the rate of 25% on worldwide income. Circular 82, as amended, clarified that dividends and other income paid by certain offshore
	enterprises controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group established outside of the PRC will be considered PRC-source income and subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty, if
	any), when paid to non-PRC enterprise shareholders. Under the implementation regulations to the New EIT Law, a &#147;place of effective management&#148; is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing
	and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the circular mentioned above specifies that certain offshore enterprises controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be
	classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or resident in the PRC: senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and personnel decision-making
	bodies; key properties, accounting books, the company seal, and minutes of board meetings and shareholders meetings; and half or more of the senior management or directors having voting rights. Although the circular only applies to offshore
	enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those controlled by PRC individuals, the determining criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation&#146;s general position on how the &#147;place of effective
	management&#148; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals.

	We believe that we are not a PRC resident enterprise. However, if the PRC tax authorities determine we are a PRC resident enterprise for EIT
	purposes, we may be required to withhold tax at the rate of 10% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty, if any) from dividends we pay to our non-PRC resident enterprise shareholders (20% for non-PRC individual shareholders), including the
	holders of our ADSs. In addition, non-PRC holders of shares and ADSs may be subject to PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Class A ordinary shares at the same rates if such income is treated as sourced from within
	the PRC. It is unclear whether our non-PRC holders of shares and ADSs would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their jurisdictions of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. See
	&#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#151;Under the New PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; of China. Such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences

	The following is a summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our ADSs or Class
	A ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder, as defined below, that acquires our ADSs and holds our ADSs or Class A ordinary shares as &#147;capital assets&#148; (generally, property held for investment) under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
	as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). This summary is based upon current United States federal tax law, which is subject to differing interpretations or change, possibly with retroactive effect. No ruling has been sought from the United States Internal
	Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) with respect to any United States federal income tax consequences described below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. This summary does not discuss all
	aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules (for example, certain financial institutions,
	insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, partnerships and their partners, tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations),
	investors who are not U.S. Holders, investors who own (directly, indirectly, or constructively) 10% or more of our voting stock, investors that hold their ADSs or Class A ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or
	other integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, or investors that have a functional currency other than the United States dollar), all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized
	below. In addition, this summary does not discuss any state, local, or non-United States tax considerations. Each potential investor is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local and non-United States income
	and other tax considerations of an investment in our ADSs or Class A ordinary shares.

	Although the law in this regard is not entirely clear, we treat our variable interest entities as being owned by us for United States federal
	income tax purposes because we control their management decisions and we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in our consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements. If
	it were determined, however, that we are not the owner of our variable interest entities for United States federal income tax purposes, we would likely be treated as a PFIC for our taxable year ended December 31, 2015 and for subsequent taxable
	years.

	Assuming that we are the owner of our variable interest entities for United States federal income tax purposes, we believe that we
	primarily operate as an active provider of managed hosting and cloud services in China. Based on the market price of our ADSs and Class A ordinary shares, the value of our assets, and the composition of our assets and income, we believe that we were
	not a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2015 and we do not expect to be a PFIC in subsequent years. While we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC, because the value of our assets for purpose of
	the asset test may be determined, in part, by reference to the market price of our ADSs or Class A ordinary shares, fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs and Class A ordinary shares may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or any
	subsequent taxable year. Under circumstances where revenues from activities that produce passive income significantly increase relative to our revenues from activities that produce non-passive income, or where we determine not to deploy significant
	amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming a PFIC may substantially increase.

	Furthermore, because there are uncertainties
	in the application of the relevant rules, it is possible that the IRS may challenge our classification of certain income and assets as non-passive or our valuation of our tangible and intangible assets, each of which may result in our becoming a
	PFIC for the current taxable year or any future taxable years. If we are a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or Class A ordinary shares, we generally will continue to be treated as a PFIC as to such U.S. Holder for all
	succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or Class A ordinary shares unless we cease to be a PFIC and the U.S. Holder makes a &#147;deemed sale&#148; election with respect to the ADSs or Class A ordinary shares.

	If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or Class A
	ordinary shares and any of our non-United States subsidiaries is also a PFIC, such U.S. Holder would, under proposed regulations, be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC and would be subject to the
	rules described above on certain distributions by a lower-tier PFIC and a disposition of shares of a lower-tier PFIC even though such U.S. holder would not receive the proceeds of those distributions or dispositions. U.S. Holders should consult

	As an alternative to the foregoing rules, if
	we are a PFIC, a U.S. Holder of &#147;marketable stock&#148; may make a mark-to-market election with respect to our ADSs, but not our Class A ordinary shares, provided that the ADSs continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and are
	regularly traded. If a U.S. Holder makes this election, the holder will generally (i) include as ordinary income for each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ADSs held at the end of the taxable year over
	the adjusted tax basis of such ADSs and (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of the ADSs over the fair market value of such ADSs held at the end of the taxable year, but such deduction will only be allowed to
	the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election.
	If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election and we cease to be a PFIC, the holder will not be required to take into account the mark-to-market gain or loss described above during any period that we are not a PFIC. If a U.S. Holder makes a
	mark-to-market election, any gain such U.S. Holder recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of our ADSs in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but such loss will only be
	treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. In the case of a U.S. Holder who has held ADSs or Class A ordinary shares during any taxable year in respect of which
	we were classified as a PFIC and continues to hold such ADSs or Class A ordinary shares (or any portion thereof) and has not previously determined to make a mark-to-market election, and who is now considering making a mark-to-market election,

	ordinary income provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met. We will be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (i) with respect to any dividend we pay on our ADSs or Class A ordinary shares that are readily tradable
	on an established securities market in the United States, or (ii) if we are eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States that the Secretary of Treasury of the United States determines is satisfactory for this
	purpose and includes an exchange of information program. Because the ADSs are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, we believe that the ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States and that we are a
	qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on the ADSs, but not with respect to dividends paid on our Class A ordinary shares. In the event we are deemed to be a resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we
	believe that we would be eligible for the benefits under the United States-PRC income tax treaty (which the U.S. Treasury Department has determined is satisfactory for this purpose) and that we would be treated as a qualified foreign corporation

	Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to interest expenses incurred in respect of bonds payable, bank and other borrowings,
	mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests in Asia Cloud Investment, capital lease obligations as well as interest income generated by excess cash, which is mostly held in interest-bearing bank deposits. As of December 31, 2015, we had: (i)
	short-term and long-term bank borrowings (current portions) with an aggregate outstanding balance of RMB314.8 million (US$48.6 million); (ii) long-term bank borrowings (excluding current portions) with an aggregate outstanding balance of RMB103.4
	million (US$16.0&nbsp;million); (iii)an outstanding principal balance of RMB2,264.3 million (US$349.5 million) with respect to the 2016 Bonds and 2017 Bonds payable; and (iv) a mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest liability of RMB100.0
	million (US$15.4 million).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The short-term bank borrowings bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.69% per annum. The long-term bank
	borrowings bore weighted-average interest rate of 6.59% per annum. The 2016 Bonds bore a coupon rate of 7.875% per annum and an effective interest rate of 9.29% per annum. The 2017 Bonds bore an interest rate of 6.875% per annum and an effective
	interest rate of 7.39% per annum. The cumulative dividend rate on the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest is 8.00% per annum. We also had RMB102.3 million (US$15.8&nbsp;million) in short-term investments with original maturities of
	greater than 90 days but less than 365&nbsp;days. A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis-point) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of approximately RMB4.2 million (US$0.6 million) in interest expense for the year
	ended December 31, 2015. We have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Interest earning instruments and interest-bearing obligations carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not been exposed to, nor do we
	anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in market interest rates. However, our future interest income and interest expenses may fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.

	be affected by the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in Renminbi, while the ADSs is traded in U.S. dollars. The
	Renminbi depreciated by 6.1% against the U.S. dollar in 2015. A hypothetical 10% increase in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have resulted in increase of RMB91.4 million (US$14.1 million) in the value of our
	U.S.&nbsp;dollar-denominated financial assets at December 31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S.
	dollars, is based on rates set by the People&#146;s Bank of China. The PRC government allowed the Renminbi to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation was
	halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. As a consequence, the Renminbi fluctuated significantly during that period against other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar.
	Since June 2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar
	in the future. As our costs and expenses are mostly denominated in RMB, the appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would increase our costs in U.S. dollar terms. In addition, as our operating subsidiaries and VIEs in China receive revenues
	in RMB, any significant depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may have a material and adverse effect on our revenues in U.S.&nbsp;dollar terms and financial condition, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ordinary shares.
	For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for capital expenditures and working capital and other business purposes, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB
	amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs, strategic acquisitions or investments or other business
	purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us.

	In the last three years, inflation in China has not materially impacted our results of operations. According to the National Bureau of
	Statistics of China, the annual average percent changes in the consumer price index in China for 2013, 2014 and 2015 were 2.6%, 2.0% and 1.4%, respectively. The year-over-year percent changes in the consumer price index for January 2013, 2014 and
	2015 were increases of 2.5%, 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Although we have not been materially affected by inflation in the past, we cannot assure you that we will not be affected in the future by higher rates of inflation in China.

	Citibank, N.A., the depositary of our ADS program, collects fees for delivery and surrender of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares
	or surrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion of
	distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary may collect its annual fee for depositary services by deductions from cash distributions or by directly billing investors or by charging the book-entry system accounts of participants acting for
	them. The depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees for those services are paid. Citibank&#146;s principal executive office is located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, 10013. The depositary bank
	typically appoints a custodian to safekeep the securities on deposit. In this case, the custodian is Citibank Hong Kong, located at 10/F, Harbour Front (II), 22, Tak Fung Street, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong. As an ADS holder, you will be required
	to pay the following service fees to the depositary bank:

	Except for certain property with carrying amounts of RMB13,943 (US$2,152) that
	were pledged to secure banking borrowings granted to the Company (Note 14), there were no pledges or collateralization of the Consolidated VIEs&#146; assets. Creditors of the Consolidated VIEs have no recourse to the general credit of the primary
	beneficiaries of the Consolidated VIEs, and such amounts have been parenthetically presented on the face of the consolidated balance&nbsp;sheets. The Consolidated VIEs operate the data centers and own facilities including data center buildings,
	leasehold improvements, fiber optic cables, computers and network equipment, which are recognized in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. They also hold certain value-added technology licenses, registered copyrights, trademarks and
	registered domain names, including the official website, which are also considered as revenue-producing assets. However, none of such assets was recorded on the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets as such assets were all acquired or
	internally developed with insignificant cost and expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company also hires data center operation and marketing workforce for its daily operations and such costs are expensed when incurred. The Company has not provided
	any financial or other support that it was not previously contractually required to provide to the Consolidated VIEs during the periods presented.

	the initial valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and the subsequent impairment assessment of long-lived assets and related goodwill, determining the provision for accounts and other receivable,
	accounting for deferred income taxes, accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, accounting for mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accounting for capital lease. The valuation of and
	accounting for the Company&#146;s purchase consideration (Note 4) also requires significant estimates and judgments provided by management. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates, and as such, differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.

	impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the entire excess of the debt security&#146;s amortized cost basis over its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made. When the Company does not
	intend to sell an impaired debt security and it is more-likely-than-not that it will not be required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company must determine whether or not it will recover its amortized cost basis. If the

	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the amounts

	The performance of the impairment test in accordance to ASC
	350 involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Fair value is primarily determined by computing the future discounted cash
	flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit. If the reporting unit&#146;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired. If this occurs, the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the
	amount of impairment loss.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a

	In accordance with ASC 350, the Company assigned and assessed goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an
	operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company has determined it has one reporting unit, which is also its only operating segment. Goodwill that has arisen as a result of the acquisitions of subsidiaries was assigned to this
	reporting unit.

	In 2015, the Company elected to assess goodwill for impairment using the two-step process. As of October&nbsp;1, 2015, the
	Company completed its annual impairment test for goodwill that has arisen out of its acquisitions. The Company determined the fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach based on the discounted expected cash flows associated with the
	reporting unit. The discounted cash flows for the reporting unit were based on six year projections. Cash flow projections were based on past experience,

	carrying amount of an asset or a group of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When these events occur, the Company evaluates for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to result

	In accordance with ASC 260,
<I>
	Earnings per Share
</I>
	, basic loss
	per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of unrestricted ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to
	ordinary shareholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive ordinary equivalent shares, if any, by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Contingently issuable shares,
	including performance-based share awards and contingent considerations to be settled in shares, are included in the computation of basic earnings per share only when there is no circumstance under which those shares would not be issued. Contingently
	issuable shares are included in the denominator of the diluted loss per share calculation as of the beginning of the period or as of the inception date of the contingent share arrangement, if later, only when dilutive and when all the necessary
	conditions have been satisfied as of the reporting period end. For contracts that may be settled in ordinary shares or in cash at the election of the Company, share settlement is presumed, pursuant to which incremental shares relating to the number
	of shares that would be required to settle the contract are included in the denominator of diluted loss per share calculation if the effect is more dilutive. For the contracts that may be settled in ordinary shares or in cash at the election of the
	counterparty, the more dilutive option of cash or share settlement is used for the purposes of diluted loss per share calculation, pursuant to which share settlement requires the number of shares that would be required to settle the contract be
	included in the denominator whereas cash settlement requires an adjustment to be made to the numerator for any changes in income or loss that would result as if the contract had been classified as an asset or a liability for accounting purposes
	during the period for a contract that is classified as equity for accounting purposes, if the effect is more dilutive. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the share options, using the treasury
	stock method. Ordinary share equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share if their effects would be anti-dilutive.

	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to

	cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB1,557,334 and RMB969,476 (US$149,661), respectively, were held at major financial institutions located in the PRC, and US$45,352 and US$176,637 (RMB1,144,220), respectively,
	were deposited with major financial institutions located outside the PRC. Management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality and continually monitors the credit worthiness of these financial institutions. Historically,
	deposits in Chinese banks are secure due to the state policy on protecting depositors&#146; interests. However, China promulgated a new Bankruptcy Law in August 2006 that came into effect on June 1, 2007, which contains a separate article expressly
	stating that the State Council may promulgate implementation measures for the bankruptcy of Chinese banks based on the Bankruptcy Law. Under the new Bankruptcy Law, a Chinese bank may go into bankruptcy. In addition, since China&#146;s concession to
	the World Trade Organization, foreign banks have been gradually permitted to operate in China and have been significant competitors against Chinese banks in many aspects, especially since the opening of the Renminbi business to foreign banks in late
	2006. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy of those Chinese banks in which the Company has deposits has increased. In the event of bankruptcy of one of the banks which holds the Company&#146;s deposits, it is unlikely to claim its deposits back in full
	since it is unlikely to be classified as a secured creditor based on PRC laws.

	For share options granted before September 30, 2011, the
	fair value of each share option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For share options granted after September 30, 2011, the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using a
	binomial-lattice option valuation model. The binomial-lattice model considers characteristics of fair value option pricing that are not available under the Black-Scholes. Similar to the Black-Scholes model, the binomial-lattice model takes into
	account variables such as volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. However, in addition, the binomial-lattice model considers the contractual term of the option, the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of
	its contractual life, and the probability of termination or retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option. For these reasons, the Company believes that the binomial-lattice model provides a fair value for its share based
	compensation plans that are more representative of actual experience and future expected experience that the value calculated in previous years using the Black-Scholes model.

	recognized as compensation expense using the straight-line method for the RSUs with graded vesting based on service conditions and the accelerated method for the RSUs with graded vesting based on performance conditions and share-settled bonuses. The
	weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 was US$14.22, US$23.27 and US$18.27, respectively. The total fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and

	The Company&#146;s ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the Company receiving distributions of funds from its
	subsidiaries. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. The
	results of operations reflected in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries.

	In accordance with the PRC Regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment and the articles of association of the Company&#146;s PRC
	subsidiaries, a foreign-invested enterprise established in the PRC is required to provide certain statutory reserves, namely general reserve fund, the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund which are appropriated from net profit
	as reported in the enterprise&#146;s PRC statutory accounts. A foreign-invested enterprise is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit to the general reserve until such reserve has reached 50% of its respective registered
	capital based on the enterprise&#146;s PRC statutory accounts. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the board of directors for all foreign-invested enterprises. The aforementioned
	reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. 21Vianet China was established as foreign-invested enterprise and, therefore, is subject to the above mandated restrictions on distributable profits. As of
	December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries had appropriated RMB52,263 and RMB63,174 (US$9,752), respectively, in its statutory reserves.

	As a result of these PRC laws and regulations subject to the limit discussed above that require annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax
	income to be set aside, prior to payment of dividends as general reserve fund, the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company. Amounts restricted include paid-in capital
	and statutory reserve funds of the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries and the equity of the Consolidated VIEs, as determined pursuant to PRC generally accepted accounting principles, totaling an aggregate of RMB 5,624,872 (US$ 868,331) as of December

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 1 &#151; Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	ASC 820 describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1) market approach; (2) income approach; and
	(3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to
	a single present value amount. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cash equivalents, fixed rate time deposits, floating rate time deposits and bonds payable are classified within Level 1 because they are valued
	by using quoted market prices.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Floating rate principal unguaranteed investments and fixed rate principal guaranteed investments are
	classified within Level 2 because the underlying assets values within these investments are directly observable in the marketplace.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests (Note 1(c)), the contingent considerations for the acquired businesses (Note 4) and the share-settled bonuses are classified within Level 3. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was estimated
	using the income approach based on the discounted cash flows (&#147;DCF&#148;) model, with adjustments for the lack of control and lack of marketability that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the noncontrolling
	interests in the Consolidated VIE. The contingent considerations are based on the achievement of certain financial targets in accordance with the sales and purchase agreements for the various periods, as well as other non-financial measures. The
	revenue and net profit targets were calculated based on the DCF model. The DCF model involves applying appropriate discount rates to estimated cash flow forecasts that are based on forecasts of revenue and costs. Estimation of future cash flows
	requires the Company to make complex and subjective judgments regarding the acquired businesses&#146; projected financial and operating results, unique business risks, limited operating histories and future prospects. The acquired businesses&#146;
	revenue forecasts were based on expected annual growth rates which were derived from a combination of our historical experience and industry trends. The fair value of the share-settled bonuses was estimated using the performance bonuses that the
	Company estimates to be settled in shares and the observable market prices of the underlying ADSs of the Company.

	As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in the process of negotiation with the seller of the Managed Network Entities on the quality
	assessment of the fiber optic network subsequent to the completion of construction. As this is a pending event subsequent to the acquisition which is unrelated to the original acquisition, the Company concluded that the accounting for any settlement
	should be separated from that of the business combination. Based on the Company&#146;s best estimate, the fair value of the related contingent consideration in shares of RMB47,755, as determined based on the remeasured amount of December 31, 2012,
	is accrued as a contingent payable pursuant to ASC 450,

	As of December 31, 2015, the Group has recognized an accrual of RMB14,492 (US$2,237) for unrecognized tax benefits and its interest (Note 23).
	The final outcome of the tax uncertainty is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitation. However, due to the uncertainties associated with the status of examinations,
	including the protocols of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these tax uncertainties. As of December 31, 2015, the Group classified the accrual
	for unrecognized tax benefits as a non-current liability.

	plaintiffs in these actions have filed motions to consolidate the cases and for appointment of a lead plaintiff, which remain pending before the court. As the actions remain in their preliminary stages, the Company&#146;s management is unable to
