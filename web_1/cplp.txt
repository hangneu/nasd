	Global economic growth is a significant driver in the demand for oil and, as a result, the demand for shipping. The past several
	years were marked by major economic slowdowns, which have had, and in part continue to have, a significant impact on the global economy and demand for oil. Global economic conditions remain fragile with significant uncertainty affecting recovery

	Furthermore, there is a general global trend towards energy efficient technologies and alternative
	sources of energy. In the long term, oil demand may be reduced by an increased reliance on alternative energy sources or a drive for increased efficiency in the use of oil, as a result of environmental concerns or high oil prices, which has the

	We expect emerging markets, which historically have had more volatile

	If global economic conditions deteriorate further or oil prices increase and, as a result, demand

<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	The shipping industry is cyclical. As a result, charter hire rates and vessel values have historically been volatile. We
	are particularly exposed to fluctuations in the product and crude tanker markets as the majority of our vessels are tankers. Therefore, as our charters expire, we may only be able to

	The demand
	for period charters may remain stagnant or decrease. Even if we secure employment for our tankers under period charters, our charterers may go bankrupt, fail to perform their obligations under the charter agreements, delay payments or suspend
	payments altogether, terminate the charter agreements prior to the agreed-upon expiration date or attempt to renegotiate the terms of the charters.

	Depending on market conditions, we may be forced to deploy our tankers in the spot market, which is cyclical and highly volatile. In the past,
	there have been periods during which spot rates have declined below the operating cost of tankers. If we deploy our tankers in the spot markets, we may be unable to obtain profitable spot charters or minimize the time spent waiting for charters or
	traveling to pick up cargo. Furthermore, as charter rates for spot charters are fixed for a single voyage of up to several weeks, we may experience delays in realizing the benefits from increases in spot charter rates.

	2016, the newbuilding order book was estimated to equal approximately 13.7% of the existing world tanker fleet and may increase further in proportion to the existing fleet. Furthermore, if newly built tankers have more capacity than the tankers

	primarily from other vessel owners, some of which have substantially larger fleets of drybulk vessels or greater resources than we currently have or will have in the future. Competition for the transportation of drybulk cargo by sea is intense and
	depends on price, customer relationships, operating expertise, professional reputation and size, age, location and condition of the vessel. In this highly fragmented market, companies operating larger fleets, as well as competitors with greater
	resources, may be able to offer lower charter rates than ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to charter out the M/V Cape Agamemnon and, accordingly, its profitability.

	With a drybulk vessel, the cargo itself and its interaction with the vessel may create operational risks. By their nature, drybulk cargoes are
	often heavy, dense and easily shifted, and they may react badly to water exposure. In addition, drybulk vessels are often subjected to battering treatment during unloading operations with grabs, jackhammers (to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold)
	and small bulldozers. This treatment may cause damage to the vessel. Vessels damaged due to treatment during unloading procedures may be more susceptible to breach while at sea. Breaches of a drybulk vessel&#146;s hull may lead to the flooding of
	the vessel&#146;s holds. If a drybulk vessel suffers flooding in its forward holds, the bulk cargo may become so dense and waterlogged that its pressure may buckle the vessel&#146;s bulkheads, leading to the loss of a vessel. If we or Capital
	Maritime, as manager, do not adequately maintain the M/V Cape Agamemnon, we may be unable to prevent these events. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
	operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and service or refinance our debt.

	The ocean-going container shipping industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter
	rates and profitability and demand for our vessels depends on a range of factors, including demand for the shipment of cargoes in containers. Containership charter rates peaked in 2005 but have declined sharply since then and have remained at or
	close to historical lows throughout 2016, as the impact of the slowdowns in the European and Chinese economies continue to affect international trade, including exports from China to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since the second half of 2011, liner companies have experienced a substantial downturn in container shipping activity, resulting in depressed
	average freight rates, which has caused financial distress at a number of liner companies, including our charterers, and could further impact them. In a number of instances, charterers have not performed under, or have requested modifications of,
	existing time charters.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Containership charter rates depend upon a range of factors, including changes in the supply and demand for ship
	capacity and changes in the supply and demand for major products transported by containerships. Demand for containerships and profitability of the container business have been affected negatively by a large order book of new containership vessels,
	including &#147;ultra large container vessels&#148;. Since the second half of 2015, a slowdown in demand in certain key container trade routes, including the Asia to Europe route, at a time of increased vessel supply has resulted in an increase of
	the idle container fleet to 7.5% as of the end of 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, the decline in the containership market has adversely affected the
	value of container vessels, which follow the trends of freight rates and containership charter rates, and resulted in a less active secondhand market for the sale of vessels.

	Competition for providing

	containership sector, including many with strong reputations and extensive resources and experience in the marine transportation industry. This increased competition may cause greater price competition for time charters. As a result of these
	factors, we may be unable to expand our relationships with existing charterers or to develop relationships with new charterers on a profitable basis, if at all, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and

	In addition, the IMO confirmed in October 2016 that a global 0.5% sulphur cap on marine fuels will come into force on January&nbsp;1,
	2020, as agreed in amendments adopted in 2008 for Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from ships (&#147;MARPOL&#148;). Annex VI sets progressively stricter regulations to control sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrous
	oxides (NOx) emissions from ships, which present both environmental and health risks. The 0.5% sulphur cap marks a significant reduction from the current global sulphur cap of 3.5%, which came into effect on January&nbsp;1, 2012. When the 2020
	sulphur cap was decided upon in 2008, it was also agreed that a review should be undertaken by 2018 to assess whether there was sufficient compliant fuel available to meet the 2020 effective date, failing which, the effective date could be deferred
	to 2025. That review was completed in July 2016 by a consortium of consultants led by CE Delft, and submitted to the IMO&#146;s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) during their 70th session. The review concluded that sufficient compliant
	fuel would be available to meet the new requirement. However, there have been competing studies, that hold the opposing view that refining capacity will not be sufficient in 2020, with an estimated
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

</FONT>
	additional sulphur plant capacity required by 2020. There have also been questions as to how the sulphur cap will be enforced, as it is up to individual parties to MARPOL to enforce fines and sanctions. A potential shortage of low sulphur marine
	fuels could drive prices upwards, which could adversely affect our profit margins, if our vessels are being chartered on the spot market or are off hire or the profit margins of our charterers.

	Our former Chairman and the founder and current chairman of Capital Maritime, Evangelos M. Marinakis, has been
	the principal owner of Olympiacos, a Greek professional football team, since January 2011 and has served as President of Olympiacos since December 2010. Mr.&nbsp;Marinakis was also President of the Superleague Greece in which Olympiacos participates
	and Vice-President of the Hellenic Football Federation between August 2010 and September 2011. Mr.&nbsp;Marinakis has informed us that, since 2011, Greek authorities have investigated allegations of match-fixing and other improprieties related to
	professional football in Greece. Various individuals, including Mr.&nbsp;Marinakis, were identified as subjects of these investigations. In June 2015, the judge in charge of the investigations provisionally ordered that Mr.&nbsp;Marinakis report
	periodically to a police station, deposit &#128;200,000 as security and refrain from football-related activities pending determination of the charges. Mr.&nbsp;Marinakis has advised us that he has cooperated with the investigations and has denied
	any wrongdoing.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In September 2016, the public prosecutor recommended to the judicial council of the Court of Appeals that some of the
	charges that were the subject of the investigations, including in relation to the alleged operation of a criminal network, be referred to trial, that other charges be dismissed and that the judicial council of the Court of Appeals place
	Mr.&nbsp;Marinakis in provisional custody (which, if approved by the judicial council, would be subject to legal challenge) on the ground that Mr.&nbsp;Marinakis allegedly breached the previous order restraining him from further football-related
	activities. The judicial council of the Court of Appeals has responsibility for determining whether to refer the charges for trial or to withdraw them and for approving or rejecting the public prosecutor&#146;s recommendation to place
	Mr.&nbsp;Marinakis in provisional custody. Capital Maritime has advised us that it is unable to assess what, if any, reputational or other harm Capital Maritime and we may suffer as a result of these proceedings. For more information on the risks

	Maritime, comprising three newbuild Daewoo
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	eco-flex

	containerships, two newbuild Samsung eco medium range product tankers and one additional Samsung eco medium range product tanker. These vessels incorporate
	many technological and design features, such as new hull and propulsion designs, energy saving devices,

	electronic engines and other equipment not previously tested on our other vessels. Certain of
	these vessels were also constructed at shipyards and by vessel construction firms with which we have not previously worked. While we expect that vessels with such features will generate increased cost savings and, in turn, increase demand for our
	charters, there is no assurance that they will do so. For example, if the current trend of decreased costs for oil and bunkers were to continue, it could substantially reduce the cost savings these vessels are expected to deliver to our charterers.
	If they do not generate the cost reduction benefits that we anticipate, competition from vessels without these features, but with lower charter rates, could adversely affect the amount of charter hire payments we receive for the vessels and, in
	turn, our return on investment on such vessels. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to make distributions and service or refinance our debt could be adversely affected.

	However, asset impairments, financial stress, enforcement actions and credit rating pressures experienced in recent years by financial
	institutions, in particular in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, combined with a general decline in the willingness of financial institutions to extend credit to the shipping industry due to depressed shipping rates and the deterioration of
	asset values that have led to losses in many banks&#146; shipping portfolios, as well as changes in overall banking regulations (including, for example, Basel III) have severely constrained the availability of credit supply for shipping companies
	such as us. For example, following heavy losses in its shipping portfolio and at the EU Commission&#146;s behest, one of our main lenders, HSH Nordbank AG, has initiated a process to be privatized by the end of February 2018.

	In addition, our ability to obtain financing or access capital markets to issue debt or equity securities may be limited by (i)&nbsp;our
	financial condition at the time of any such financing or issuance, (ii)&nbsp;adverse market conditions affecting the shipping industry, including weaker demand for, or increased supply of, product tankers, drybulk and container vessels, whether as a
	result of general economic conditions or the financial condition of charterers and operators of vessels, (iii)&nbsp;weaknesses in the financial markets, (iv)&nbsp;restrictions imposed by our credit facilities, such as collateral maintenance

	As a result, our ability to obtain financing to fund capital expenditures, acquire new vessels or refinance our existing indebtedness, is
	and may continue to be limited. If we are unable to obtain additional financing or issue further equity or debt securities, our ability to fund current and future obligations may be impaired. In addition, restrictions in the availability of credit
	supply may result in higher interest costs, which would reduce our available cash for distributions. Any failure to obtain funds for necessary future capital expenditures, to grow our asset base or to refinance our existing indebtedness on terms
	that are commercially acceptable could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to make cash distributions and service or refinance our debt, and could cause the market

	Following the national elections in Greece in September 2015, the previous government led by Greek political parties from the left and right
	wings has been kept in place. While the new government announced its commitment to the European Union and the Euro, it is required to implement in return a new Memorandum of Understanding between Greece and the &#147;Troika&#148;, comprised of the
	European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, which includes numerous austerity measures and could potentially result in increased taxation for shipping companies. These and related developments may have adverse effects on the Greek economy as well as

	Our fleet had an average age of approximately 7.4 years as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. In general, the costs of maintaining a vessel in good
	operating condition increase with the age of the vessel. Older vessels are typically less fuel efficient than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. In addition, cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a
	vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers. Older vessels might also require higher capital expenditure to comply with regulations that came into force after their construction and their values might depreciate faster than more modern
	vessels. As a result, an ageing fleet might affect our ability to remain in compliance with bank covenants and/or refinance our debt.

	If, depending on our ability to obtain required financing and access the financial markets, we determine to
	expand our fleet by entering into contracts for newbuildings directly with shipyards, we generally will be required to make installment payments prior to their delivery. We typically must pay between 5% and 25% of the purchase price of a vessel upon
	signing the purchase contract, even though delivery of the completed vessel will not occur until much later (approximately 18&#150;36 months later for current orders), which could reduce cash available for distributions to unitholders. If we finance

	To fund the acquisition price of a business or of any additional vessels we may contract to purchase from Capital Maritime or other third

	As an international shipping company, we may operate in countries known to have a reputation for
	corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the &#147;FCPA&#148;) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations in applicable jurisdictions generally prohibit companies registered with the SEC and their intermediaries from making
	improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. Legislation in other countries
	includes the U.K. Bribery Act, which became effective on July&nbsp;1, 2011. The U.K. Bribery Act is broader in scope than the FCPA because it does not contain an exception for facilitating payments (i.e., payments to secure or expedite the
	performance of a &#147;routine governmental action&#148;) and covers bribes and payments to private businesses as well as foreign public officials. We and our customers may be subject to these and similar anti-corruption laws in other applicable
	jurisdictions. Failure to comply with such legal requirements could expose us to civil and/or criminal penalties, including fines, prosecution and significant reputational damage, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and
	results of operations, including our relationships with our customers, and our financial results. Compliance with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws and related regulations and policies imposes potentially
	significant costs and operational burdens. Moreover, the compliance and monitoring mechanisms that we have in place, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which incorporates our anti-bribery and corruption policy, may not adequately

	We generally do not do business in sanctions-targeted jurisdictions unless an activity is
	authorized by the appropriate governmental or other sanctions authority. Except as otherwise described below, we and our general partner and its affiliates have not entered into agreements or other arrangements with the governments or any
	governmental entities of sanctioned countries, and we and our general partner and its affiliates do not have any direct business dealings with officials or representatives of any sanctioned governments or entities. In addition, our charter
	agreements include provisions that restrict trades of our vessels to countries or to

	targeted by economic sanctions unless such trades involving sanctioned countries or persons are permitted
	under applicable economic sanctions and embargo regimes. Although we have various policies and controls designed to help ensure our compliance with these economic sanctions and embargo laws, it is nevertheless possible that third-party charterers of
	our vessels, or their

	In order to help maintain our compliance with applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations, we monitor and review the movement of our
	vessels, as well as the cargo being transported by our vessels, on a continuing basis. In 2016, our vessels under time charter contracts made approximately 1,642 total calls on worldwide ports. None of the vessels in our fleet made any port calls in
	Cuba or Syria.

	In 2016, vessels owned by CPLP and chartered under time charter parties to Product&nbsp;&amp; Crude Tanker Chartering Inc.
	(&#147;PCTC&#148;), a subsidiary of CMTC, our sponsor and the sole member of our general partner, made the following port calls to Iran: five port calls to load crude oil, gas condensate or naphtha, three port calls to discharge gasoline and one
	port call to discharge vegetable oils. These port calls represented approximately 0.5% of the total port calls made by all the vessels owned by CPLP in 2016, and each of them occurred while the respective vessel was sublet under voyage charter by
	PCTC to a third-party

	In one instance, the
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	sub-charterer
</FONT>
	of a vessel
	was the National Iranian Oil Company, a government-owned corporation under the direction of the Ministry of Petroleum of Iran. As the vessel owner, we earned revenues at the agreed daily charter rates from PCTC. PCTC in turn earned revenues at the
	agreed freight rate from the

	Further, in 2016, vessels
	owned by CMTC and chartered under voyage charter contracts by third-party charterers made the following port calls to Iran: ten port calls to load crude oil and ten port calls to load steel or sulphur products. These port calls represented 3.6% of
	the total port calls made by all the vessels owned by CMTC in 2016, and each of them occurred while the respective vessel was chartered out to a third-party charterer under the instructions of such charterer. As the vessel owner, CMTC earned
	revenues at the agreed freight rate from the charterers that employed the vessels.

	Under the MARPOL Annex VI requirements,
	all ships trading in designated emission control areas are using fuel oil on board with a sulfur content of no more than 0.10% after January&nbsp;1, 2015. Outside the emission control areas, the current limit for sulfur content of fuel oil is 3.50%.
	The IMO confirmed in October 2016 that a global 0.5% sulphur cap on marine fuels will come into force on 1&nbsp;January 2020, as agreed in amendments adopted in 2008 for Annex VI to MARPOL. Annex VI sets progressively stricter regulations to control
	sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrous oxides (NOx) emissions from ships, which present both environmental and health risks. The 0.5% sulphur cap marks a significant reduction from the current global sulphur cap of 3.5%, which had been implemented since
	1&nbsp;January 2012. When the 2020 sulphur cap was decided upon in 2008, it was also agreed that a review should be undertaken by 2018 to assess whether there was sufficient compliant fuel available to meet the 2020 date, failing which, the date
	could be deferred to 2025. That review was completed in July 2016 by a consortium of consultants led by CE Delft, and submitted to the IMO&#146;s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) during their 70th session. The review concluded that
	sufficient compliant fuel would be available to meet the new requirement. However, there have been competing studies, that hold the opposing view that refining capacity will not be sufficient in 2020, with an estimated
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	60-70%
</FONT>
	additional sulphur plant capacity required by 2020. There have also been questions as to how the sulphur cap will be enforced, as it is up to individual parties to MARPOL to enforce fines and sanctions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Shipowners can meet the new requirements by continuing to use fuel types which exceed the 0.5% sulphur limit and retrofitting an approved
	Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (also known as scrubbers) to remove sulphur from exhaust, which might require a substanatial capital expenditure and prolonged offhire of the vessel during installation; or use petroleum fuels such as marine gasoil
	(&#147;MGO&#148;), which meet the 0.5% sulphur limit. According to Platts, the premium of MGO over 380 CST 3.5% bunker fuel in Rotterdam has averaged $270/mt over the last five years. Depending on the vessel type and size, this could mean a
	substantial increase in the cost of bunkers for the vessel. This cost could increase further if the refining sector is unable to cope with the higher distillate demand, resulting in a tight distillate market and wider spread between high sulfur fuel
	oil and MGO; or by retrofitting the vessel to handle alternative fuels, such as LNG, methanol, biofuels, liquefied petroleum gas (&#147;LPG&#148;) etc. Retrofitting vessels for the consumption of these type of alternative fuels would involve a
	substantial capital expenditure and might be uneconomical for most conventional vessel types in light of current technology and design challenges. Similarly MARPOL Annex VI requires Tier III standards for NOx emissions to be applied to ships
	constructed and engines installed in ships operating in NOx emission control areas from January&nbsp;1, 2016.

	example, our General Partner&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its Chief Operating Officer are also executive officers of Capital Maritime. The affiliates of our General Partner conduct substantial businesses and
	activities of their own in which we have no economic interest. As a result, there could be material competition for the time and effort of the officers of our General Partner who also provide services to our General Partner&#146;s affiliates, which
	could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make cash distributions and service or refinance our debt.

	flexibility of our fleet and our compliance with existing regulatory standards, are attractive to our charterers, providing them with a high degree of flexibility in the types of cargoes and variety in the trade routes they may choose as they employ

	Crude Carriers management agreement
</U>
	: In September 2011, we completed our merger with Crude Carriers. Currently, three of the five crude tanker vessels we acquired as part of the merger continue to be managed
	under a management agreement entered into in March 2010, as amended, with Capital Ship Management whose initial term expires on December&nbsp;31, 2020. Under the terms of this agreement we compensate our Manager for all of its expenses and
	liabilities incurred on our behalf while providing the agreed services to us, including, but not limited to, crew, repairs and maintenance, insurance, stores, spares, lubricants and other operating and administrative costs. Until December&nbsp;31,
	2016 we also paid our Manager the following fees: (a)&nbsp;a daily technical management fee per managed vessel that is revised annually based on the United States Consumer Price Index; (b)&nbsp;a sale&nbsp;and purchase fee equal to 1% of the gross
	purchase or sale price upon the consummation of any purchase or sale of a vessel acquired by Crude Carriers and (c)&nbsp;a commercial services fee equal to 1.25% of all gross charter revenues generated by each vessel for commercial services
	rendered. Our Manager has agreed to waive the sale and purchase fee as well as the commercial services fee from January&nbsp;1, 2017 onwards. Our Manager has the right to terminate the Crude Carriers management agreement and, under certain
	circumstances, could receive substantial sums in connection with such termination; however, even if our board of directors or our unitholders are dissatisfied with the Manager, there are limited circumstances under which we can terminate this
	management agreement. This termination fee was initially set at $9.0&nbsp;million in March 2010 and increases on each
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	one-year
</FONT>
	anniversary during which the management agreement remains in effect (on a
	compounding basis) in accordance with the total percentage increase, if any, in the United States Consumer Price Index over the immediately preceding 12 months. Since March 2016, this termination fee has been $9.9&nbsp;million.

	We expect that as the fixed fee management agreement expires for the five remaining vessels to which it currently applies, these vessels will
	be managed under floating fee management agreements on terms similar to those currently in place. We expect that new acquisitions we may make in the future will also be managed under similar floating fee management agreements. Under the terms of all
	three agreements, Capital Ship Management may either provide these services directly to us or subcontract them to other entities, including other Capital Maritime subsidiaries.

	At the time of our IPO on April&nbsp;3, 2007, our fleet consisted of eight vessels. Since that date, the size of our fleet has expanded in
	terms of both number of vessels and carrying capacity. Our fleet currently consists of 36 vessels of various sizes with an average age of approximately 7.4 years and average remaining term under our charters of approximately 5.6 years (each, as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2016).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We intend to continue to take advantage of our unique relationship with Capital Maritime and, subject to
	prevailing shipping, charter and financial market conditions and the approval of our board of directors, make strategic acquisitions in the medium to long term in a prudent manner that is accretive to our unitholders and to long-term distribution
	growth. Please read &#147;Item 4A: History and Development of the Partnership&#151;2015 Developments&#151;Delivery of Dropdown Vessels&#148; for a more detailed description of the right of first refusal Capital Maritime granted to us with respect to
	the acquisition of additional product tanker vessels. In addition, we may pursue opportunities for acquisitions of, or combinations with, other shipping businesses. Pursuant to the amended and restated omnibus agreement we have entered into with
	Capital Maritime in connection with our merger with Crude Carriers, Capital Maritime has granted us a right of first offer for any product tanker in its fleet with carrying capacity of over 30,000 dwt under time or bareboat charter with a remaining
	duration of at least twelve months. Capital Maritime is, however, under no obligation to fix any of these vessels under charters of longer than twelve months. Please read &#147;Item 7B: Related-Party Transactions&#148; for a detailed description of
	our amended and restated omnibus agreement with Capital Maritime.

	The table below provides summary information as of December&nbsp;31,
	2016 about the vessels in our fleet, as well as their delivery date or expected delivery date to us and their employment, including earliest possible redelivery dates of the vessels and relevant charter rates. The table also includes the daily
	management fee and approximate expected termination date of the respective management agreement with Capital Ship Management with respect to each vessel. Sister vessels, which are vessels of similar specifications and size typically built at the
	same shipyard, are denoted by the same letter in the table. We believe that sister vessels provide a number of efficiency advantages in the management of our fleet.

	In &#147;Item 5F: Contractual Obligations and Contingencies&#151;Critical Accounting Policies&#151;Vessel Lives and

	result, the charter-free market value of certain of our vessels may have declined below those vessels&#146; carrying value, even though we would not record an impairment of their carrying value under our accounting impairment policy due to our
	belief that future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by such vessels over their operating lives would exceed such vessels&#146; carrying amounts.

	of our vessels we believe has a charter free market value below its carrying value; and (iii)&nbsp;the aggregate difference between carrying value and market value represented by such vessels. This aggregate difference represents the approximate
	analysis of the amount by which we believe we would have to reduce our net income if we sold all of such vessels in the current environment, on industry standard terms, in cash transactions, and to a willing buyer where we are not under any
	compulsion to sell, and where the buyer is not under any compulsion to buy. For purposes of this calculation, we have assumed that the vessels would be sold at a price that reflects our estimate of their current basic market values.

	Our estimates of basic market value assume that our vessels are all in good and seaworthy condition without need for repair and, if inspected,
	would be certified in class without notations of any kind. Our estimates are based on the average of two estimated market values for our vessels received from third-party independent shipbrokers approved by our banks. You should note that vessel
	values are highly volatile; as such, our estimates may not be indicative of the current or future basic market value of our vessels or prices that we could achieve if we were to sell them.

	the aggregate carrying value of these vessels, assessed separately, exceeds their aggregate basic charter-free market value by approximately $388.8&nbsp;million and $130.1&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This
	increase of $258.7&nbsp;million in 2016 as compared to 2015 is due to the decrease of asset values of our vessels, as a consequence of a slowdown in the underlying charter markets that negatively affected market values of vessels. As discussed in
	&#147;Critical Accounting Policies&#151;Vessel Lives and Impairment&#148;, we believe that the carrying values of our vessels as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 were recoverable as the undiscounted projected net operating cash flows of these
	vessels exceeded their carrying value by a significant amount.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, all the vessels in our fleet were under medium- to long-term time or bareboat charters with an average remaining
	term under our charters of approximately 5.6 years. Under certain circumstances, we may operate our vessels in the spot market or certain of our vessels may remain idle until they are fixed under appropriate medium- to long-term charters. As our
	vessels come up for

	counterparties, expected expiration dates of the charters and daily charter rates.

	A time charter is a contract for the use of a vessel for a fixed period of time at a specified daily rate. Under a time charter, the
	vessel&#146;s owner provides crewing and other services related to the vessel&#146;s operation, the cost of which is included in the daily rate and the charterer is responsible for substantially all vessel voyage costs except for commissions which
	are assumed by the owner. The basic hire rate payable under the charters is a previously agreed daily rate, as specified in the charter, payable at the beginning of the month in U.S. Dollars. We currently have 31 vessels under time charter
	agreements, of which two contain profit-sharing provisions that allow us to realize, at a predetermined percentage, additional revenues when spot rates or actual charter rates are higher than the base rates incorporated in our charters or, in some
	instances, through greater utilization of our vessels by our charterers.

	We currently have a profit sharing arrangement in place for M/T Amadeus which is under a time charter with Capital Maritime and is based on the
	calculation of the vessel&#146;s actual earnings and is settled every six months. We have a similar profit sharing arrangement for the M/T Amor, once it commences its two month time charter with Capital Maritime. In the event actual time charter
	equivalent (&#147;TCE&#148;) over that period is higher than the agreed daily charter rate of the vessel, we receive the basic net hire rate plus 50% of the excess over the gross daily charter rate. This means that actual voyage revenues earned and
	received, actual expenses incurred and actual time taken to perform the voyages during that period are used for purposes of the calculation. The charterer is obligated to provide us with a copy of each fixture note and all reasonable documentation
	with respect to items of cost and earnings.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The amounts received under profit-sharing arrangements are subject to the usual commissions
	payable to shipbrokers on gross charter rates. Please read &#147;Item 4B: Business Overview&#151;Our Fleet&#148;, including the table and accompanying notes, for additional information.

	TCE rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily
	earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charter hire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charter hire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts.
	TCE is expressed as per ship per day rate and is calculated as voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of operating days during the period, which is consistent with industry standards.

	A bareboat charter is a contract pursuant to which the vessel owner provides the vessel to the customer for a fixed period of time at a
	specified daily rate, and the customer provides for all of the vessel&#146;s expenses (including any commissions) and generally assumes all risk of operation. In the case of the vessels under bareboat charter to BP Shipping Limited, we are
	responsible for the payment of any commissions. The customer undertakes to maintain the vessel in a good state of repair and efficient operating condition and drydock the vessel during this period at its cost and as per the classification society

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had five vessels
	under bareboat charter, two with BP&nbsp;Shipping Limited and three with subsidiaries of INSW. The charters with subsidiaries of INSW were initially entered into with subsidiaries of OSG. Following the spinoff of the international business arm of
	OSG, INSW succeeded to OSG under the charter guarantee. Those charters include options for the charterer to purchase each vessel for $38.0&nbsp;million, $35.5&nbsp;million or $33.0&nbsp;million at the end of the eighth, ninth or tenth year of the
	charter, respectively. In each case, the option to purchase the vessel must be exercised six months prior to the end of the charter year. In exchange of our agreement to substitute INSW for OSG under the charters, INSW agreed to increase the
	bareboat charter rate for the three vessels from $6,250 per day to $6,600 per day from November&nbsp;30, 2016 until the redelivery of the vessels under the bareboat charters.

	Shipping in general, and crude oil, refined product and chemical tankers, in particular, have been, and will remain, heavily regulated. Many
	international and national rules, regulations and other requirements&#151;whether imposed by the classification societies, international statutes (IMO, SOLAS (defined below), MARPOL, etc.), national and local administrations or industry&#151;must be
	complied with in order to enable a shipping company to operate and a vessel to trade.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Traditionally there have been relatively few large
	players in the oil trading business and the industry is continuously consolidating. The
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	so-called
</FONT>
	&#147;oil majors companies&#148;, such as BP, Chevron Corporation, Philips66 Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation,
	Royal Dutch Shell plc, Statoil ASA, and Total S.A., together with a few smaller companies, represent a significant percentage of the production, trading and, especially, shipping logistics (terminals) of crude and refined products worldwide.
	Concerns for the environment, health and safety have led the oil majors to develop and implement a strict due diligence process when selecting their commercial partners. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk
	assessment of both the vessel operator and the vessel.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While a plethora of parameters are considered and evaluated prior to a commercial
	decision, the oil majors, through their association, the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (&#147;OCIMF&#148;), have developed and are implementing two basic tools: (i)&nbsp;a Ship Inspection Report Programme (&#147;SIRE&#148;) and
	(ii)&nbsp;the Tanker Management&nbsp;&amp; Self Assessment (&#147;TMSA&#148;) Program. The former is a physical ship inspection based upon a thorough vessel inspection questionnaire and performed by accredited OCIMF inspectors, resulting in a report
	being logged on SIRE, while the latter is a recent addition to the risk assessment tools used by the oil majors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based upon commercial
	needs, there are three levels of risk assessment used by the oil majors: (i)&nbsp;terminal use, which will clear a vessel to call at one of the oil major&#146;s terminals; (ii)&nbsp;voyage charter, which will clear the vessel for a single voyage;
	and (iii)&nbsp;term charter, which will clear the vessel for use for an extended period of time. The depth, complexity and difficulty of each of these levels of assessment vary. While for the terminal use and voyage charter relationships, a ship
	inspection and the operator&#146;s TMSA will be sufficient for the assessment to be undertaken, a term charter relationship also requires a thorough office assessment. In addition to the commercial interest on the part of the oil major, an excellent
	safety and environmental protection record is necessary to ensure an office assessment is undertaken.

	Class&nbsp;renewal surveys (also known as special surveys) are carried out at the intervals indicated by the classification for the hull,
	which are usually at five-year intervals. During the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	Non-Destructive
</FONT>
	Inspections to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the
	thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the classification society will order steel renewals. The classification society may grant a three-month extension for completion of the special survey under certain conditions. Substantial
	amounts of funds may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every five years, a ship-owner or manager has the option, depending on the type of
	ship, of arranging with the classification society for the vessel&#146;s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five-year cycle. At an owner&#146;s application, the surveys

	The operation of any ocean-going vessel carries an inherent risk of catastrophic marine disasters, death or personal injury and property losses
	caused by adverse weather conditions, mechanical failures, human error, war, terrorism, piracy and other circumstances or events. The occurrence of any of these events may result in loss of revenues or increased costs or, in the case of marine
	disasters, catastrophic liabilities. Although we believe our current insurance program is usual and comprehensive in our industry, we cannot insure against all risks, and we cannot be certain that all covered risks are adequately insured against or
	that we will be able to achieve or maintain similar levels of coverage throughout a vessel&#146;s useful life. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid by the insurer or that it will always be possible to obtain
	insurance coverage at reasonable rates. More stringent environmental regulations in the past have resulted in increased costs for, and may result in the lack of availability of, insurance against the risks of environmental damage or pollution.
	Moreover, under the terms of our bareboat charters, the charterer provides for the insurance of the vessel, and, as a result, these vessels may not be adequately insured and/or in some cases may be self-insured. Any uninsured or under-insured loss

	industrial production correlate with peaks in demand for marine drybulk transportation services. A wide range of cargoes are transported by container but most notably container transportation is responsible for the shipment of a diverse selection of
	manufactured and consumer goods in unitized form. These cargoes are transported by container to end users in all regions of the world, and in particular, from key producing and manufacturing regions to end users in the world&#146;s largest consumer

	Demand for tankers and tonnage of oil shipped is primarily a function of global oil
	consumption, which is driven by economic activity, as well as the long-term impact of oil prices on the location and related volume of oil production. Global oil demand returned to limited growth in 2010 and has since been expanding at a modest
	pace, driven by a steady rise in Asia. According to the International Energy Agency, global oil demand for 2016 has been revised as of December 2016 to 96.3 mb/day compared to 94.9 mb/day during 2015.

	Tonnage of oil shipped is also influenced by transportation alternatives (such as pipelines) and the output of refineries. Between 2012 and
	2014, it is estimated that 18 refineries, predominantly in OECD countries, with combined throughput of approximately 2.4 mb/day, ceased operations as a result of weak margins. Europe has been hit the hardest as the region&#146;s aging refineries
	have struggled to adjust to the lower demand and weaker profit margins that accompanied the economic slowdown. European refineries have also been hit by increased competition from newer refineries in the Middle East and Asia, which benefit from
	lower operating costs. It is estimated that refinery capacity in the Middle East and Asia combined increased by 2.3 mb/day during the years 2015 and 2016. In 2017, a notable number of additional refineries are expected to start operations in Asia.

	OPA 90 affects all vessel
	owners and operators transporting crude oil or petroleum products to, from, or within U.S. waters. The law phased out the use of single-hull tankers and can effectively impose unlimited liability on vessel owners and operators in the event of an oil

<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	costs and other damages, including natural resource damages, and for

	caused by gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a violation of certain regulations, in which case, liability is unlimited. On November&nbsp;19, 2015, USCG issued a final rule to raise these limits to the greater of $2,200/gross ton or
	$18.79&nbsp;million. In addition, OPA 90 does not preempt state law and permits individual states to impose their own stricter liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Certain coastal states have
	enacted additional pollution prevention, liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. Bills are introduced periodically in the U.S. Congress to increase the limits of OPA liability for all vessels, including tanker vessels.

	first bottom survey after January&nbsp;1, 2016. A number of BWTS technologies have already received Alternate Management System (&#147;AMS&#148;) extension approval, but to date none of the systems available in the market have received a USCG type
	BWTS approval certificate. We have applied to the USCG for AMS extensions for all of our vessels with a bottom survey within 2016, and will apply by year end for extensions for all vessels with due docking dates within 2017. So far, our applications
	for vessels with due docking dates within 2016 have been successful and extensions for these vessels have been granted until January 2018&nbsp;by the USCG and EPA. Although further extensions may be granted if suitable USCG certified BWTS are not
	made available in due course, compliance with this requirement at a later date may impose substantial costs for retrofitting our vessels with BWTS or otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters.

	The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants and
	other air contaminants. The Clean Air Act also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (&#147;SIPs&#148;) designed to attain national health-based air quality standards, which have significant regulatory impacts in major metropolitan
	and/or industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. Individual states, including California, also regulate vessel emissions within
	state waters. California also has adopted fuel content regulations that will apply to all vessels sailing within 24 miles of the California coastline or whose itineraries call for them to enter any California ports, terminal facilities, or internal
	or estuarine waters. In addition, IMO designates areas extending 200 miles from the U.S. territorial sea baseline adjacent to the Atlantic/Gulf and Pacific coasts and the eight main Hawaiian Islands as Sulphur Emission Control Areas under amendments
	to the Annex VI of MARPOL (discussed below). In addition, regulatory initiatives to require cold- ironing (shore-based power while docked) are under consideration in a number of jurisdictions to reduce air emissions from docked ships. Compliance
	with these regulations entails significant capital expenditures or otherwise increases the costs of our operations.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In September 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships to address air pollution
	from ships. Annex VI sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content
	of fuel oil and allows for special sulphur emission control areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions (&#147;SECA areas&#148;).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Amendments to Annex VI to the MARPOL address particulate matter, nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions. The revised Annex VI reduces air
	pollution from vessels by, among other things (i)&nbsp;implementing a progressive reduction of sulfur oxide emissions from ships, and (ii)&nbsp;establishing new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine engines, depending
	on their date of installation. The IMO confirmed in October 2016 that a global 0.5% sulphur cap on marine fuels will come into force on January&nbsp;1, 2020, as agreed in amendments adopted in 2008 for Annex VI to the MARPOL. Annex VI sets
	progressively stricter regulations to control sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrous oxides (NOx) emissions from ships, which present both environmental and health risks. The 0.5% sulphur cap marks a significant reduction from the current global sulphur
	cap of 3.5%, which came into effect on January&nbsp;1, 2012. When the 2020 sulphur cap was decided upon in 2008, it was also agreed that a review should be undertaken by 2018 to assess whether there was sufficient compliant fuel available to meet
	the 2020 effective date, failing which, the effective date could be deferred to 2025. That review was completed in July 2016 by a consortium of consultants led by CE Delft, and submitted to the IMO&#146;s Marine Environment Protection Committee
	(MEPC) during their 70th session. The review concluded that sufficient compliant fuel would be available to meet the new requirement. However, there have been competing studies, that hold the opposing view that refining capacity will not be
	sufficient in 2020, with an estimated
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	60-70%
</FONT>
	additional sulphur plant capacity required by 2020. There have also been questions as to how the sulphur cap will be enforced, as it is up to individual parties to
	MARPOL to enforce fines and sanctions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Shipowners can meet the new requirements by continuing to use fuel types which exceed the 0.5%
	sulphur limit and retrofitting an approved Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (also known as scrubbers) to remove sulphur from exhaust, which might require a substantial capital expenditure and prolonged offhire of the vessel during installation; or use
	petroleum fuels such as marine gasoil (MGO), which meet the 0.5% sulphur limit. According to Platts, the premium of MGO over 380 CST 3.5% bunker fuel in Rotterdam has averaged $270/mt over the last five years. Depending on the vessel type and size,
	this could mean a substantial increase in the cost of bunkers for the vessel. This cost could increase further if the refining sector is unable to cope with the higher distillate demand, resulting in a tight distillate market and wider spread
	between HSFOs and MGOs; or by retrofitting the vessel to handle alternative fuels, such as LNG, methanol, biofuels, LPG etc. Retrofitting vessels for the consumption of these type of alternative fuels would involve a substantial capital expenditure
	and might be uneconomical for most conventional vessel types given current technology and design challenges.

	Additionally, as of
	January&nbsp;1, 2015, more stringent sulfur emission standards apply in coastal areas designated as Sulphur Emission Control Areas. We incur additional costs to comply with these revised standards. A failure to comply with Annex VI requirements
	could result in a vessel not being able to operate. All of our vessels are subject to Annex VI regulations. We believe that our existing vessels meet relevant Annex VI requirements and that our undelivered product tankers will be fitted with these
	emission control systems prior to their delivery. Nevertheless, as most existing vessels are not designed to operate on
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	SOLAS new requirements necessitate installation of ECDIS equipment (electronic charts) for some type of vessels at the 1st radio survey
	carried out after July&nbsp;1, 2015. For container vessels, this requirement comes in force at the first radio survey after 1st&nbsp;July 2016. While some of our vessels are already fitted with ECDIS equipment requiring only minimal upgrades, a
	number of our vessels are not fitted with such equipment and additional expenditure might be incurred to comply with this regulation.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	ISM code, promulgated by the IMO, also requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting
	forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. The ISM code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. No vessel
	can obtain a certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM code. All of our ocean-going vessels are ISM certified.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Noncompliance with the ISM code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to

	Many countries have ratified and follow the liability plan adopted by the IMO and set out in the
	International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (the &#147;CLC&#148;) (the United States, with its separate OPA 90 regime, is not a party to the CLC). Under this convention and depending on whether the country in which
	the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, a vessel&#146;s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a
	contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain defenses. Under the Protocol for vessels of 5,000 to 140,000 gross tons, liability is limited to approximately $7.1&nbsp;million plus $989.2 for each additional gross ton over
	5,000. For vessels of over 140,000 gross tons, liability is limited to approximately $140.7&nbsp;million. As the convention calculates liability in terms of a basket of currencies, these figures are based on currency exchange rates on
	December&nbsp;31, 2010. The right to limit liability is forfeited under the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage where the spill is caused by the owner&#146;s actual fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill
	is caused by the owner&#146;s intentional or reckless conduct. Vessels trading to states that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. In jurisdictions where the International
	Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law regimes govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to that convention. We believe that
	our P&amp;I insurance will cover the liability required under the plan adopted by the IMO.

	national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, as amended). Our fleet has been issued with a certificate attesting that

	The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or Kyoto
	Protocol,&nbsp;requires participating countries&nbsp;to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases
	from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol. However, new treaties may be adopted in the future that include restrictions on shipping emissions. The European Union also has indicated that it intends to propose an expansion of
	the existing European Union emissions trading scheme to include emissions of greenhouse gases from vessels. In addition, the EPA has begun regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act and climate change initiatives are being
	considered in the U.S. Congress. A consensus agreement reached at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris and ratified in October 2016 commits participating nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a goal of keeping global
	temperature increases well below two degrees Celsius, with regular five-year reviews of progress beginning in 2023. National and multilateral efforts to meet these goals could result in reductions in the use of carbon fuels generally, and stricter
	limits on greenhouse gas emissions from ships in particular. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, European Union, the U.S. or other countries where we operate that restrict emissions of greenhouse
	gases could have a financial impact on our operations that we cannot predict with certainty at this time. In addition, scientific studies have indicated that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can produce climate changes

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are an international owner of tanker, container and drybulk vessels. We were organized in January 2007 by Capital Maritime, an
	international shipping company with a long history of operating and investing in the shipping market. Our fleet currently consists of 36 high specification vessels with an average age of approximately 7.4 years as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. Our
	fleet is comprised of four Suezmax crude oil tankers (0.6&nbsp;million dwt), 21 medium range product tankers (0.9&nbsp;million dwt), ten post-panamax container carrier vessels (0.9&nbsp;million dwt) and one Capesize bulk carrier (0.2&nbsp;million
	dwt). Our vessels are capable of carrying a wide range of cargoes, including crude oil, refined oil products, such as gasoline, diesel, fuel oil and jet fuel, edible oils and certain chemicals, such as ethanol, as well as dry cargo and containerized
	goods.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our primary business objective is to pay a quarterly distribution per unit and increase our distributions over time, subject to
	shipping and charter market developments and our ability to obtain required financing and access financial markets.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We seek to rely on
	medium- to long-term, fixed-rate period charters and Capital Ship Management&#146;s cost-efficient management of our vessels to provide visibility of revenues, earnings and distributions in the medium- to long-term. As our vessels come up for
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	re-chartering,
</FONT>
	we seek to redeploy them on terms that reflect our expectations of the market conditions prevailing at the time.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We intend to further evaluate potential opportunities to acquire both newly built and second-hand vessels from Capital Maritime or third
	parties (including, potentially, through the acquisition of, or combination with, other shipping businesses) in a prudent manner that is accretive to our unitholders and long-term distribution growth, subject to approval of our board of directors,
	overall market conditions and our ability to obtain required financing and access financial markets.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Consistent with this strategy, we
	currently have a right of first refusal to acquire five additional product tanker vessels from Capital Maritime, as further described in &#147;Item 4A: History and Development of the Partnership&#151;2015 Developments&#151;Delivery of Dropdown
	Vessels&#148;.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We generally rely on external financing sources, including bank borrowings and, depending on market conditions, the
	issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund the acquisition of new vessels. See &#147;&#151;B. Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; below.

	We generate revenues by

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, HMM, Petrobras, CMA CGM and Capital Maritime accounted for 19%, 18%, 17% and 15% of
	our revenues, respectively. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, Capital Maritime and HMM accounted for 29% and 21% of our revenues, respectively. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, Capital Maritime, HMM and Maersk Line accounted for

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	HMM, the charterer of five of our container vessels and one of our largest counterparties in terms of revenue, completed a financial
	restructuring in July 2016. Our subsidiaries owning vessels under charter with HMM entered into a charter restructuring agreement with HMM on July&nbsp;15, 2016. This agreement provides for the reduction of the charter rate payable under the
	respective charter parties by 20% to $23,480 per day (from a gross daily rate of $29,350) for a three and a half year period starting in July 2016 and ending in December 2019. The total charter rate reduction for the charter reduction period is
	approximately $37.0&nbsp;million. The charter restructuring agreement further provides that at the end of the Charter Reduction Period, the charter rate under the respective charter parties will be restored to the original gross daily rate of
	$29,350 until the expiry of each charter in 2024 and 2025. As compensation for the charter rate reduction, we received approximately 4.4&nbsp;million HMM common shares, which we sold on the Stock Market Division of the Korean Exchange for an
	aggregate consideration of $29.7&nbsp;million in August 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In October 2016, we acquired the shares of the company owning the M/T Amor, an
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	eco-type
</FONT>
	MR product
	tanker, with time charters attached expiring in October 2017 (at the earliest). We accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of a business based on the existence of an integrated set of activities (inputs and processes that generate outputs).
	Therefore, we recorded the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, consisting of the vessel, the time charter attached to the vessel and a term loan assumed on acquisition, in our financial statements at their fair values of
	$31.6&nbsp;million, $1.1&nbsp;million and $15.8&nbsp;million, respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2016, we acquired the shares of the company
	owning the M/V CMA CGM Magdalena, the last of the five vessels we agreed to acquire from Capital Maritime pursuant to the Master Vessel Acquisition Agreement (to which we refer herein as the Dropdown Vessels), with time charter attached expiring in
	January 2021 (at the earliest). We accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of an asset. As we estimated that the daily charter rate of the time charter attached to the vessel was above market rates as of the transaction completion date, we
	allocated the total consideration for this acquisition to the vessel cost $88.5&nbsp;million and to the above market acquired charter $3.2&nbsp;million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In July 2014, we entered into a Master Vessel Acquisition Agreement with Capital Maritime, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire, subject to
	the satisfaction of various conditions precedent, the Dropdown Vessels for an aggregate purchase price of $311.5&nbsp;million. As consideration for these vessel acquisitions at prices below current market value, we agreed to amend the partnership
	agreement to revise the target distributions to holders of our incentive distribution rights. In September 2014, we paid the amount of $30.2&nbsp;million to Capital Maritime as an advance payment on the acquisition of the Dropdown Vessels. During
	2015, we acquired four of the five Dropdown Vessels which we accounted for as acquisitions of assets. For more information, please read Note 5 (Fixed Assets) and Note 12 (Partners&#146; Capital) in our Financial Statements included herein.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	2016, the tanker charter market, where the majority of our fleet operates and where we expect the vast majority of our renewals will occur in the next couple of years, was overall weaker due to, among other factors, high oil inventories, lower oil
	demand growth compared to 2015 and increased supply of vessels. As a result, we secured employment for a number of our vessels at reduced rates on average in 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2016, in the container market, certain key routes have seen a sharp slowdown in demand at a time of increased supply of container vessels,
	which has further depressed container charter rates and asset values. While all but two of our container vessels come up for
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	re-chartering
</FONT>
	after 2020, we depend on the ability of vessel charterers, which have
	come under significant financial stress, to honor their commitments. For further information, see &#147;Item 3.D Risks Factors&#151;Risks Related to the Container Carrier Industry&#151;
<I>
	If our container carrier vessel charterers do not fulfill
	their obligations to us, or if they are unable to honor their obligations, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make cash distribution and service or refinance our debt can be adversely
	affected.

	Any contemplated

	fragile with significant uncertainty surrounding levels of recovery and long-term economic growth effects. If the estimated asset values of the vessels in our fleet decrease, we may be obligated to prepay part of our outstanding debt in order to
	remain in compliance with the relevant covenants in our credit facilities. A decline in the market value of our vessels could also affect our ability to refinance our credit facilities and/or limit our ability to obtain additional financing. A
	decrease of 10% in the aggregate fair market values of our vessels would not cause any violation of the total indebtedness to aggregate market value covenant contained in our credit facilities.

	been affected. We consider these market developments as indicators of potential impairment of the carrying amount of our assets. We performed undiscounted cash flow tests as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, as an impairment analysis, in which we
	made estimates and assumptions relating to determining the projected undiscounted net operating cash flows by considering the following:

	During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, our board of directors held nine meetings. Even if Board members are not able to attend a board
	meeting, all board members are provided information related to each of the agenda items before each meeting, and can therefore, provide counsel outside regularly scheduled meetings. All directors were present at all meetings of the board of

	Although the Nasdaq Global Select
	Market does not require a listed limited partnership like us to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating/corporate governance committee, our board of directors has
	established an audit committee and a conflicts committee comprised solely of independent directors. Each of the committees operates under a written charter adopted by our board of directors which is available under &#147;Corporate Governance&#148;
	in the Investor Relations tab of our web site at www.capitalpplp.com. The membership and main functions of each committee are described below.

	. The audit committee of our board of directors is composed of three or
	more independent directors, each of whom must meet the independence standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the SEC and any other applicable laws and regulations governing independence from time to time. The audit committee is currently
	comprised of directors Abel Rasterhoff (chair), Pierre de Demandolx-Dedons, Keith Forman and Dimitris Christacopoulos. All members of the committee are financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr.&nbsp;Rasterhoff qualifies
	as an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148; for purposes of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The audit committee, among other things, reviews our external financial reporting, engages our external auditors and oversees our internal audit
	activities and procedures and the adequacy of our internal accounting controls. The audit committee met four times during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, on January&nbsp;20,&nbsp;April&nbsp;21,&nbsp;July&nbsp;21 and October&nbsp;20, 2016.

	Conflicts Committee.
</I>
	The conflicts committee of our board of directors is composed of the same directors constituting the audit
	committee, being Keith Forman (chair), Abel Rasterhoff, Pierre de Demandolx-Dedons and Dimitris Christacopoulos. The members of our conflicts committee may not be officers or employees of our General Partner or directors, officers or employees of
	its affiliates, and must meet the independence standards established by the Nasdaq Global Select Market to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain other requirements. The conflicts committee reviews specific matters that the
	board believes may involve conflicts of interest and determines if the resolution of the conflict of interest is fair and reasonable to us.&nbsp;Any matters approved by the conflicts committee will be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to
	us, approved by all of our partners, and not a breach by our directors, our General Partner or its affiliates of any duties any of them may owe us or our unitholders. The conflicts committee met eleven times during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
	2016, on January&nbsp;1, June&nbsp;24, July&nbsp;27, August&nbsp;29, August&nbsp;30, September&nbsp;5, September&nbsp;7, October&nbsp;6, October&nbsp;13, October&nbsp;19 and December 16.

	Our partnership affairs are governed by our partnership agreement and the MILPA. The provisions of the MILPA resemble
	provisions of the limited partnership laws of a number of states in the United States, most notably Delaware. We are not aware of any material difference in unitholder rights between the MILPA and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership
	Act. The MILPA also provides that it is to be applied and construed to make the laws of the Marshall Islands, with respect to the subject matter of the MILPA, uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and, so long as it does not conflict with
	the MILPA or decisions of certain Marshall Islands courts, the
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	law (or &#147;case law&#148;) of the State of Delaware is adopted as the law of the Marshall Islands. There have been, however, few,
	if any, court cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the MILPA, in contrast to Delaware, which has a fairly well-developed body of case law interpreting its limited partnership statute.

	of our unitholders and fiduciary responsibilities of our General Partner and its affiliates under Marshall Islands law are not as clearly established as under judicial precedent in existence in Delaware. Due to the less-developed nature of Marshall
	Islands law, our public unitholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by our General Partner, its affiliates or controlling unitholders than would unitholders of a limited partnership organized in the

	Fiduciary duties are generally considered to include an obligation to act in good faith and with due care and loyalty. The duty of care, in the absence of a provision in a partnership agreement providing otherwise, would generally
	require a General Partner and the directors of a Marshall Islands limited partnership to refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law. The duty of loyalty, in the absence of a
	provision in a partnership agreement providing otherwise, would generally require that a partner refrain from dealing with the limited partnership in the conduct or winding up of the limited partnership business or affairs as or on behalf of a party
	having an interest adverse to the limited partnership, refrain from competing with the limited partnership in the conduct of the limited partnership&#146;s business or affairs before the dissolution of the limited partnership, and to account to the
	limited partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the partner in the conduct or winding up of the limited partnership&#146;s business or affairs or derived from a use by the partner of partnership property,
	including the appropriation of a limited partnership opportunity. In addition, although not a fiduciary duty, a partner shall discharge the duties to the limited partnership and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and
	fair dealing.

	Our cash distribution policy generally reflects a basic judgment that our unitholders are better served by us distributing our
	available cash (after deducting expenses, including cash reserves) rather than retaining it. Because we believe that, subject to our ability to obtain required financing and access financial markets, we will generally finance any expansion capital
	expenditures from external financing sources, we believe that our investors are best served by us distributing all of our available cash. The board of directors seeks to maintain a balance between the level of reserves it takes to protect our
	financial position and liquidity against the desirability of maintaining distributions on the limited partnership interests. We intend to review our distributions from time to time in the light of a range of factors, including, among other things,
	our access to the capital markets, the repayment or refinancing of our external debt, the level of our capital expenditures and our ability to pursue accretive transactions.

	In April 2016, in the face of severely depressed trading prices for master limited partnerships, including us, a significant deterioration in our cost of capital and potential loss of revenue, the board of directors
	made the decision to protect our liquidity position by creating a capital reserve, provisioning further reserves and setting distributions at a level that the board believes to be sustainable and consistent with the proper conduct of our business.
	The capital reserve, set by the board of directors at approximately $14.6&nbsp;million per quarter, is intended to address amortization requirements under our credit facilities through the end of 2018. Accordingly, our board of directors issued a

	For purposes of determining operating surplus, maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to
	maintain over the long term the operating capacity of or the revenue generated by our capital assets, and expansion capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that increase the operating capacity of or the revenue generated by our capital
	assets. To the extent, however, that capital expenditures associated with acquiring a new vessel increase the revenues or the operating capacity of our fleet, those capital expenditures would be classified as expansion capital expenditures.

	Examples of maintenance and replacement capital
	expenditures include capital expenditures associated with drydocking, modifying an existing vessel or acquiring a new vessel to the extent such expenditures are incurred to maintain the operating capacity of or the revenue generated by our fleet.
	Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures will also include interest (and related fees) on debt incurred and distributions on equity issued to finance the construction of a replacement vessel and paid during the construction period, which we
	define as the period beginning on the date that we enter into a binding construction contract and ending on the earlier of the date that the replacement vessel commences commercial service or the date that the replacement vessel is abandoned or
	disposed of. Debt incurred to pay or equity issued to fund construction period interest payments, and distributions on such equity, will also be considered maintenance and replacement capital expenditures.

	Our partnership agreement provides that an amount equal to an estimate of the average quarterly maintenance and replacement capital
	expenditures necessary to maintain the operating capacity of or the revenue generated by our capital assets over the long term be subtracted from operating surplus each quarter, as opposed to the actual amounts spent. In the partnership agreement,
	we refer to these estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures to be subtracted from operating surplus as &#147;estimated maintenance capital expenditures.&#148; The amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures
	deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by our board of directors at least once a year, provided that any change must be approved by our conflicts committee. The estimate is made at least annually and whenever an event occurs
	that is likely to result in a material adjustment to the amount of our maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, such as a major acquisition or the introduction of new governmental regulations that will affect our fleet. For purposes of
	calculating operating surplus, any adjustment to this estimate is prospective only. Our board of directors has elected not to deduct any replacement capital expenditures from our operating surplus since 2011.

	The partnership agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as a return of capital. Each time a distribution of capital
	surplus is made, the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reduced in the same proportion as the distribution had to the fair market value of the common units prior to the announcement of the distribution. Because

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Assuming that a limited partner does not participate in the control of our business within the meaning of the MILPA and that such limited
	partner otherwise acts in conformity with the provisions of our partnership agreement, that partner&#146;s liability under the MILPA will be limited, subject to possible exceptions, to the amount of capital he or she is obligated to contribute to us
	for his or her units plus his or her share of any undistributed profits and assets. If a court determined, however, that limited partners &#147;participated in the control&#148; of our business for the purposes of the MILPA, then such limited
	partners could be held personally liable for our obligations under the laws of Marshall Islands, to the same extent as our General Partner, to persons who transact business with us who reasonably believe, based on the limited partner&#146;s conduct,
	that the limited partner is a general partner. Neither our partnership agreement nor the MILPA specifically provides for legal recourse against our General Partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability through any fault of our General
	Partner.
<I>
	While this does not mean that a limited partner could not seek legal recourse, we know of no precedent for this type of a claim in Marshall Islands case law.
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the MILPA, a limited partnership may not make a distribution to a partner if, after the distribution, all liabilities of the limited
	partnership, other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership, exceeds the fair value of the assets of the limited
	partnership, except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the limited partnership only to the extent that the fair value of that property
	exceeds that liability. The MILPA provides that a limited partner who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the MILPA shall be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of
	the distribution for three years after the date of such distribution. Under the MILPA, a purchaser of units who becomes a limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of the transferor to make contributions to the
	partnership, except that the transferee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to him at the time he became a limited partner and that could not be ascertained from the partnership agreement.

	The partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited amount of additional partnership securities and rights to buy partnership

	reasonably expected to be accretive to equity within 12 months of issuance or which would otherwise have a material adverse impact on our General Partner or its interest in us. However, as long as Class&nbsp;B Units are outstanding, we may not
	authorize, create or issue any equity interests senior to the Class&nbsp;B Units or amend the provisions of an existing class of securities to make such class senior in priority to the Class&nbsp;B Units without the affirmative vote or written
	consent of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Class&nbsp;B Units, voting separately as a class based on one vote per unit.

	Upon

	1.96%. Our General Partner&#146;s interest in us will thus be reduced if we issue additional partnership securities in the future and our General Partner does not elect to maintain its then-applicable General Partner interest in us. Our General
	Partner will have the right, which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its affiliates, to purchase common units or other equity securities whenever, and on the same terms that, we issue those securities to persons other
	than our General Partner and its affiliates, to the extent necessary to maintain its and its affiliates&#146; percentage interest, including its interest represented by common units, that existed immediately prior to each issuance. Other holders of
	common units will not have similar preemptive rights to acquire additional common units or other partnership securities. Upon issuance of additional partnership interests that, with respect to distributions, rank

	The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to current and prospective common
	unitholders. This discussion is based upon provisions of the Code, Treasury Regulations, and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect or existence on the date of this Annual Report and all of which are subject
	to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below.

	The following discussion applies only to beneficial owners of our common units that own such units as &#147;capital assets&#148; (generally,
	for investment purposes) and does not comment on all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation which may be important to particular common unitholders in light of their individual circumstances, such as unitholders subject to special tax rules (e.g.,

	units entitled to vote, or U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below. If a partnership or other entity
	classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our common units, the tax treatment of a partner thereof will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the tax treatment of the partnership. If you are a partner
	in a partnership holding our common units, you should consult your tax advisor.

	We are

	(ii)&nbsp;any such income earned by subsidiaries that are corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, are organized in a jurisdiction that grants an Equivalent Exemption and whose outstanding stock is owned 50% or more by value by us) will be
	exempt from U.S. federal income taxation provided we meet the Publicly Traded Test. In addition, since our common units are only traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is considered to be an established securities market, our common units

	We believe we meet the trading volume requirements
	of the Section&nbsp;883 Exemption because the pertinent regulations provide that trading volume requirements will be deemed to be met with respect to a class of equity traded on an established securities market in the United States where, as will be
	the case for our common units, the units are regularly quoted by dealers who regularly and actively make offers, purchases and sales of such units to unrelated persons in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, the pertinent regulations also
	provide that a class of equity will be considered to be &#147;regularly traded&#148; on an established securities market if (i)&nbsp;such class of stock is listed on such market; (ii)&nbsp;such class of stock is traded on such market, other than in
	minimal quantities, on at least 60&nbsp;days during the taxable year or one sixth of the days in a short taxable year and (iii)&nbsp;the aggregate number of shares of such class of stock traded on such market during the taxable year is at least 10%
	of the average number of shares of such class of stock outstanding during such year, or as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year. We believe that trading of our common units has satisfied these conditions in the past, and we
	expect that such conditions will continue to be satisfied. Finally, we believe that our common units represent more than 50% of our voting power and value and accordingly we believe that our units should be considered to be &#147;regularly

	These conclusions, however, are based upon legal authorities that do not expressly contemplate an
	organizational structure such as ours. In particular, although we have elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for corporate law purposes we are organized as a limited partnership under Marshall Islands law and
	our General Partner is responsible for managing our business and affairs and has been granted certain veto rights over decisions of our board of directors. Accordingly, it is possible that the IRS could assert that our units do not meet the
	&#147;regularly traded&#148; test.

	We expect that our units will not lose eligibility for the Section&nbsp;883 Exemption as a result of
	the Closely Held Block Exception, because our partnership agreement provides that the voting rights of any 5% Unitholders (other than our General Partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the approval of
	our board of directors) are limited to a 4.9% voting interest in us regardless of how many common units are held by that 5% Unitholder. (The voting rights of any such unitholders in excess of 4.9% will be redistributed pro rata among the other
	common unitholders holding less than 4.9% of the voting power of all classes of units entitled to vote). If Capital Maritime and our General Partner own 50% or more of our common units, they will provide the necessary documents to establish an
	exception to the application of the Closely Held Block Exception. This exception is available when shareholders residing in a jurisdiction granting an Equivalent Exemption and meeting certain other requirements own sufficient shares in the Closely
	Held Block to preclude shareholders who have not met such requirements from owning 50% or more of the outstanding class of equity relied upon to satisfy the Publicly Traded Test.

	Subject to the discussion of the rules applicable to PFICs below, any distributions made by us with respect to our common units to a U.S.
	Holder generally will constitute dividends, which may be taxable as ordinary income or &#147;qualified dividend income&#148; as described in more detail below, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under
	U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in its common units on a

	Dividends paid on our common units to a U.S. Holder who is an individual, trust or estate (or a
	&#147;U.S. Individual Holder&#148;) will be treated as qualified dividend income that is taxable to such U.S. Individual Holder at preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gain provided that: (i)&nbsp;our common units are readily tradable
	on an established securities market in the United States (such as the Nasdaq Global Select Market, on which our common units are traded); (ii)&nbsp;we are not a PFIC (which we do not believe we are, have been or will be, as discussed below);

	units that are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed as ordinary income to a U.S. Individual Holder. Special rules may apply to any &#147;extraordinary dividend&#148; paid by us. An extraordinary dividend is, generally, a dividend
	with respect to a unit if the amount of the dividend is equal to or in excess of 10&nbsp;percent of a unitholder&#146;s adjusted basis (or fair market value in certain circumstances) in such unit. If we pay an &#147;extraordinary dividend&#148; on
	our common units that is treated as &#147;qualified dividend income&#148;, then any loss derived by a U.S. Individual Holder from the sale or exchange of such units will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of such

	that such holder directly or indirectly owns exceeds certain thresholds, such holder must file IRS Form 8621 with the holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax return to report the holder&#146;s ownership of our common units.

	If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election (such U.S. Holder, an &#147;Electing Holder&#148;), the Electing Holder must report each year for

	received from us by the Electing Holder. The Electing Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the common units will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed income. Distributions of earnings and profits that had been previously taxed will result
	in a corresponding reduction in the adjusted tax basis in the common units and will not be taxed again once distributed. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common
	units. A U.S. Holder would make a QEF election with respect to any year that we are a PFIC by filing one copy of IRS Form 8621 with his U.S. federal income tax return and a second copy in accordance with the instructions to such form. If contrary to
	our expectations, we determine that we are treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, we will attempt to provide each U.S. Holder with all necessary information in order to make the QEF election described above.

	Euros). These liabilities were translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on December&nbsp;31, 2016. We have not hedged currency exchange risks and our operating results could be adversely affected as a result.

	The
	international tanker industry is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of investment, a significant portion of which is provided in the form of long-term debt. Our current debt contains interest rates that fluctuate with LIBOR. Our 2007
	credit facility and 2008 credit facility each bear an interest margin of 3.0%&nbsp;per annum over US$ LIBOR, respectively. Our 2011 credit facility bears an interest margin of 3.25%&nbsp;per annum over US$ LIBOR, our 2013 credit facility bears an
	interest margin of 3.50%&nbsp;per annum over US$ LIBOR and the 2015 credit facility bears an interest margin of 2.50% per annum over US$ LIBOR. Therefore, we are exposed to the risk that our interest expense may increase if interest rates rise.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Currently we have, and during 2016 we had, no interest rate swap agreements outstanding. As a result of a possible market disruption in
	determining the cost of funds for our banks, any increases by the lenders to their &#147;funding costs&#148; under our credit facilities will lead to proportional increases in the relevant interest amounts payable under such credit facilities on a
	quarterly basis. As an indication of the extent of our sensitivity to interest rate changes based upon our debt level, an increase of 100 basis points in LIBOR would have resulted in an increase in our interest expense by approximately
	$6.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, assuming all other variables had remained constant.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Capital Product Partners L.P. and subsidiaries (the

	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
	over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
	necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	A company&#146;s internal control
	over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company&#146;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company&#146;s board of directors,
	management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
	company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
	assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
	the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
	company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of the inherent limitations of internal
	control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
	evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
	or procedures may deteriorate.

	The Nasdaq Global Select Market requires limited partnerships
	with listed units to comply with its corporate governance standards. As a foreign private issuer, we are not required to comply with all of the rules that apply to listed U.S. limited partnerships. However, we have generally chosen to comply with
	most of the Nasdaq Global Select Market&#146;s corporate governance rules as though we were a U.S. limited partnership. Although we are not required to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors or to establish a compensation
	committee or a nominating/corporate governance committee, our board of directors has established an audit committee and a conflicts committee comprised solely of independent directors. Accordingly, we do not believe there are any significant
	differences between our corporate governance practices and those that would typically apply to a U.S. domestic issuer that is a limited partnership under the corporate governance standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Please see &#147;Item
	6C: Board Practices&#148; and &#147;Item 10B: Memorandum and Articles of Association&#148; for more detail regarding our corporate governance practices.

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
	that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the

	the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 3, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Partnership&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.

	Accounting for Revenue, Voyage and Operating Expenses:
</I>
</B>
	The Partnership generates its revenues from charterers for the charter hire of its vessels. Vessels are chartered on time charters, bareboat charters
	or voyage charters. A time charter is a contract for the use of a vessel for a specific period of time and a specified daily charter hire rate, which is generally payable monthly in advance. Some of the Partnership&#146;s time charters also include
	profit sharing provisions, under which the Partnership can realize additional revenues in the event that spot rates are higher than the base rates in these time charters. A bareboat charter is a contract in which the vessel owner provides the vessel
	to the charterer for a fixed period of time at a specified daily rate, which is generally payable monthly in advance, and the charterer generally assumes all risk and costs of operation during the bareboat charter period. A voyage charter is a
	contract, in which the vessel owner undertakes to transport a specific amount and type of cargo on a load
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	port-to-discharge
</FONT>
</FONT>
	port basis, subject to various cargo handling
	terms. Under a typical voyage charter, the vessel owner is paid on the basis of moving cargo from a loading port to a discharge port. In voyage charters the vessel owner is generally responsible for paying both vessel operating costs and voyage
	expenses, and the charterer generally is responsible for any delay at the loading or discharging ports. A voyage is deemed to commence upon the later of the completion of discharge of the vessel&#146;s previous cargo or upon vessel arrival to the
	agreed upon port, based on the terms of a voyage contract that is not cancellable and voyage is deemed to end upon the completion of discharge of the delivered cargo. Revenues under voyage charter agreements are recognized on a
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	pro-rata
</FONT>
	basis.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Time, bareboat and voyage charter revenues are recognized when a charter
	agreement exists, charter rate is fixed and determinable, the vessel is made available to the lessee, and collection of the related revenue is reasonably assured. Revenues are recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the period of the
	respective charter. Revenues from profit sharing arrangements in time charters represent a portion of time charter equivalent (voyage income less direct expenses, divided by operating days), that exceeds the agreed base rate and are recognized in
	the period earned.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Deferred revenue represents cash and other assets received in advance of being earned and deferred revenue resulting
	from straight-line revenue recognition in respect of charter agreements that provide for varying charter rates. The portion of the deferred revenue that will be earned within the next twelve months is classified as current liability and the rest as
	long-term liability.

	Vessel voyage expenses are direct expenses to voyage revenues and primarily consist of commissions, port expenses,
	canal dues and bunkers. Commissions are expensed over the related charter period and all the other voyage expenses are expensed as incurred. In general, under time and bareboat charter agreements, all voyages expenses, except commissions are assumed
	by the charterer. For voyage charters, all voyage expenses are paid by the Partnership.

	An impairment loss on long-lived assets is recognized when indicators of impairment are present and the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is greater than its fair
	value and not believed to be recoverable. In determining future benefits derived from use of long-lived assets, the Partnership performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long-lived assets. If the
	carrying value of the asset, including any related intangible assets and liabilities, exceeds its undiscounted future net cash flows, the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. Various factors including future charter rates and vessel

	In recent years, market conditions, as compared to previous years, have
	changed significantly as a result of the global credit crisis and resulting slowdown in world trade. Charter rates decreased and values of assets were affected. The Partnership considered these market developments as indicators of potential
	impairment of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets. The Partnership has performed an undiscounted cash flow test based on US&nbsp;GAAP as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, determining undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for the
	vessels and comparing them to the carrying values of the vessels, and any related intangible assets and liabilities. In developing estimates of future cash flows, the Partnership made assumptions about future charter rates, utilization rates, vessel
	operating expenses, future dry docking costs&nbsp;and the estimated remaining useful life of the vessels. These assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations that are in line with the Partnership&#146;s historical
	performance and expectations for the vessels&#146; utilization under the current deployment strategy.&nbsp;Based on these assumptions, the Partnership determined that the vessels&#146; and their related intangible assets and liabilities were not
	impaired as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015.

	The Partnership records all identified tangible and intangible assets or any liabilities associated with the acquisition of a business or an asset at fair value. When an asset or a

	equivalent duration. When determining present value, the Partnership uses Weighted Average Cost of Capital (&#147;WACC&#148;).&nbsp;The resulting above-market (assets) and below-market (liabilities) charters are amortized using the straight line
	method as a reduction and increase, respectively, to revenues over the remaining term of the charters.

	Segment Reporting:

	The Partnership reports financial information and evaluates its operations by charter revenues and not by the length, type of vessel or type of ship employment for its customers, i.e.
	time or bareboat charters. The Partnership does not use discrete financial information to evaluate the operating results for each such type of charter or vessel. Although revenue can be identified for these types of charters or vessels, management
	cannot and does not identify expenses, profitability or other financial information for these various types of charters or vessels. As a result, management, including the chief operating decision maker, reviews operating results solely by revenue
	per day and operating results of the fleet, and thus the Partnership has determined that it operates as one reportable segment. Furthermore, when the Partnership charters a vessel to a charterer, the charterer is free to trade the vessel worldwide
	and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic information is impracticable.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
</B>
	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued the Accounting Standard Update (&#147;ASU&#148;)
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	2017-01
</FONT>
	Business Combinations to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisition (or
	disposals) of assets or businesses. Under current implementation guidance the existence of an integrated set of acquired activities (inputs and processes that generate outputs) constitutes an acquisition of business. This ASU provides a screen to
	determine when a set of assets and activities does not constitute a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group
	of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This update is effective for public entities with reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The amendments of this ASU should be
	applied prospectively on or after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period 1) for transactions for which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the ASU, only when the
	transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance and 2) for transactions in which a subsidiary is deconsolidated or a group of assets is derecognized that occur before the issuance date
	or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of this
	new standard.

	provides the Partnership with certain commercial and technical management services for a fixed daily fee per managed vessel which covers the commercial and technical management services, the respective vessels&#146; operating costs such as crewing,
	repairs and maintenance, insurance, stores, spares, and lubricants as well as the cost of the first special survey or next scheduled

	may vary from time to time. The Partnership also pays a fixed daily fee per bareboat chartered vessel in its fleet, mainly to cover compliance and commercial costs, which include those costs incurred by the Manager to remain in compliance with the

	On July&nbsp;24, 2014, the Partnership entered into a Master Agreement with CMTC to acquire five companies that own five
	vessels under construction (the &#147;new buildings&#148;) with attached time charters, subject to the amendment of the partnership agreement to reset the target distributions to holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights&nbsp;(the
	&#147;IDRs&#148;) (Note 12). As the reset of the IDRs was a
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	pre-condition
</FONT>
	for the acquisition of the vessels, the amount of $36,417, representing the difference between the fair value of $347,917 of the
	respective new buildings at the time of the approval of this transaction in August 2014 at the Partnership&#146;s annual general meeting and the contractual cash consideration of $311,500, was considered to be the deemed equity contribution and thus
	the fair value of the reset of the IDRs. The fair value of the IDRs reset has been accounted for in Partner&#146;s capital and is presented as &#147;Excess between the fair value of the contracted vessels and the contractual cash consideration&#148;
	in the consolidated statements of changes in partners&#146; capital in the Partnership&#146;s consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. The fair value of the new buildings amounting to $347,917 was based on the average of three
	valuations obtained from three independent shipbrokers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Two of these five vessels are 50,000 dwt product carriers and the remaining three are 9,100 TEU
	post-panamax container carriers.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During 2015 the Partnership acquired from CMTC the shares of four out of the five vessel owning companies. As a result,
	as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the amount of $18,172 consisted of advances totalling $7,921 that the Partnership paid to CMTC for the acquisition of the remaining vessel owning company and the fair value from the reset of the IDRs of $10,251 which
	was attributable to this vessel, and is presented as &#147;Advances&nbsp;for&nbsp;vessels&nbsp;under construction&#150;related&nbsp;party&#148; in the Partnership&#146;s consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. On February&nbsp;26,
	2016 the Partnership acquired the company owning the M/V CMA CGM Magdalena, which was the last out of the five vessel owning companies the Partnership agreed to acquire from CMTC according to the terms of the Master Agreement. As a result there were
	no &#147;Advances&nbsp;for&nbsp;vessels&nbsp;under construction&#150;related&nbsp;party&#148; as of December&nbsp;31, 2016.

	On October&nbsp;24, 2016, the Partnership acquired the shares of the company
	owning the M/T Amor (Note 3). The Partnership accounted for this acquisition as an acquisition of business based on the existence of an integrated set of activities (inputs and processes that generate outputs). Therefore the vessel was recorded in
	the Partnership&#146;s financial statements at its fair value of $31,600 as quoted by independent ship brokers at the time of her acquisition by the Partnership.

	On February&nbsp;26, 2016, the Partnership acquired the shares of the company owning the M/V CMA CGM Magdalena for a total consideration of $81,500 which was
	funded by loan drawdown of $35,000 from the Partnership&#146;s 2013 credit facility (Note 7) and the remaining balance of $46,500 by the Partnership&#146;s cash. The Partnership accounted for this transaction as acquisition of an asset based on the
	absence of processes attached to the inputs. Other than the new building&nbsp;and the attached time charter, no other inputs and no processes were acquired. The Partnership considered whether any value should be assigned to the attached charter
	party agreement acquired and concluded that the contracted daily charter rate was above the market rates on the transaction completion date and therefore, the total consideration was allocated to the vessel cost and the above market acquired
	charter. Thus the vessel was recorded&nbsp;in the Partnership&#146;s financial statements at a cost of $88,545 and the above market acquired charter at a cost of $3,206 (Note&nbsp;6).

	On March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;June&nbsp;10, June&nbsp;30 and September&nbsp;18, 2015, the Partnership acquired the shares of the companies owning the M/T Active, the
	M/V CMA CGM Amazon, the M/T Amadeus and the M/V CMA CGM Uruguay for a total consideration of $230,000 which was funded by loan drawdowns of $115,000 from the Partnership&#146;s 2013 credit facility and the remaining balance of $115,000 through the
	Partnership&#146;s cash. The Partnership accounted for the acquisition of the companies owning the M/T Active, the M/V CMA CGM Amazon, the M/T Amadeus and the M/V CMA CGM Uruguay as acquisition of assets based on the absence of processes attached to
	the inputs. Other than the new buildings&nbsp;and the attached time charters, no other inputs and no processes were acquired. The Partnership considered whether any value should be assigned to the attached charter party agreements acquired and
	concluded that the contracted daily charter rates approximated market rates on the transaction completion dates and therefore, the total consideration was allocated to vessel cost. Thus these vessels were recorded in the Partnership&#146;s financial
	statements at their cost of $256,166. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 the Partnership had paid advances of $22,303 to CMTC for the acquisition of the shares of these vessel owning companies. The difference of $26,166 between the vessels&#146; cost of
	$256,166 and the total consideration of $230,000 was part of the excess of $36,417 that the Partnership had recorded in its financial statements in August 2014 upon the approval of the Master Agreement and the IDRs reset at the Partnership&#146;s

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Partnership follows the accounting guidance for financial instruments that establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
	accounting principles, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.&nbsp;This guidance enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the
	quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The statement requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level&nbsp;1: Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the
	ability to access at the measurement date;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level&nbsp;2: Inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level&nbsp;1 that are
	observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level&nbsp;3: Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or
	liability.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, which are considered Level&nbsp;1 items as they represent liquid assets
	with short-term maturities, trade receivables, amounts due from related parties and due to related parties, trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value. The fair values of long-term variable rate bank loans
	approximate the recorded values, due to their variable interest being the LIBOR and due to the fact the lenders have the ability to pass on their funding cost to the Partnership under certain circumstances, which reflects their current assessed
	risk. We believe the terms of our loans are similar to those that could be procured as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. LIBOR rates are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full terms of the loans and hence bank loans are considered
	Level&nbsp;2 items in accordance with the fair value hierarchy.

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Financial instruments which potentially subject the Partnership to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents
	and trade accounts receivable. The Partnership places its cash and cash equivalents, consisting mostly of deposits, with creditworthy financial institutions rated by qualified rating agencies. A limited number of financial institutions hold the
	Partnership&#146;s cash. Most of the Partnership&#146;s revenues were derived from a few charterers. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd (&#147;HMM&#148;), Petroleo Brasileiro S.A, CMA CGM and CMTC accounted for
	19%, 18%, 17% and 15% of the Partnership&#146;s total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 CMTC and HMM accounted for 29% and 21% of the Partnership&#146;s total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December&nbsp;31,
	2014 CMTC, HMM and A.P. Moller-Maersk A.S. (&#147;Maersk&#148;) accounted for 38%, 24% and 12% of the Partnership&#146;s total revenue, respectively. The Partnership does not obtain rights of collateral from its charterers to reduce its credit risk.

	The general partner&#146;s and
	common unit holders&#146; interests in net income are calculated as if all net income for periods subsequent to April&nbsp;4, 2007, were distributed according to the terms of the partnership agreement, regardless of whether those earnings would or
	could be distributed. The partnership agreement does not provide for the distribution of net income; rather, it provides for the distribution of available cash (Note 12), which is a contractually-defined term that generally means all cash on hand at
	the end of each quarter after establishment of cash reserves determined by the Partnership&#146;s board of directors to provide for the proper resources for the Partnership&#146;s business. Unlike available cash, net income is affected by
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-cash
</FONT>
	items. The Partnership follows the guidance relating to the Application of the
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	Two-Class
</FONT>
	Method and its application to Master Limited Partnerships which considers
	whether the incentive distributions of a master limited partnership represent a participating security when considered in the calculation of earnings per unit under the
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	Two-Class
</FONT>
	Method.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This guidance also considers whether the partnership agreement contains any contractual limitations concerning distributions to the IDRs that would impact the
	amount of earnings to allocate to the IDRs for each reporting period.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the partnership agreement, the holder of the IDRs in the Partnership, which
	is currently CGP, assuming that there are no cumulative arrearages on common unit distributions, has the right to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributions (Note 12). The Partnership excluded the effect of the 12,983,333, 12,983,333 and
	14,223,737 Class&nbsp;B Convertible Preferred Units in calculating dilutive EPU as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively as they were anti-dilutive.

	awards in calculating dilutive EPU for its common unitholders as they were anti-dilutive. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 there were no

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	HMM, the charterer of five of the Partnership&#146;s vessels, namely Hyundai Prestige, Hyundai Premium, Hyundai Paramount, Hyundai Privilege and Hyundai
	Platinum (the &#147;HMM Vessels&#148;), each under time charter expiring in 2024 and 2025, has experienced financial difficulties and has pursued a financial restructuring involving various creditors and vessel owners.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As part of the various agreements that HMM reached with its creditors and vessel owners under its voluntary debt restructuring, the owning companies of the
	HMM Vessels entered into a Charter Restructuring Agreement on July&nbsp;15, 2016. This agreement provides for the reduction of the gross charter rate payable under the respective charter parties by 20% to $23.5 per day from $29.4, for a three and a
	half year period starting in July 2016 and ending in December 2019 (the &#147;Charter Reduction Period&#148;). As compensation the Partnership received 4,398,910 HMM common shares on August&nbsp;4, 2016, which the Partnership recognized as a
	&#147;Trading asset&#148; at the amount of $29,706 being the fair value of the shares with a corresponding &#147;Deferred revenue, current&#148; and &#147;Deferred revenue&#148; to be amortized within revenue over the remaining duration of each time
	charter. The shares were immediately sold on the Stock Market Division of the Korean Exchange for aggregate cash consideration of $29,706. The Charter Restructuring Agreement further provides that at the end of the Charter Reduction Period, the
	charter rate under the respective charter parties will be restored to the original daily rate of $29.4 until the expiry of each charter in 2024 and 2025.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Various claims, suits,
	and complaints, including those involving government regulations and product liability, arise in the ordinary course of the shipping business. In addition, losses may arise from disputes with charterers, agents, insurance and other claims with
	suppliers relating to the operations of the Partnership&#146;s vessels. The Partnership is not aware of any such claims or contingent liabilities, which should be disclosed, or for which a provision should be established in the accompanying
	consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Partnership accrues for the cost of environmental liabilities when management becomes aware that a liability is
	probable and is able to reasonably estimate the probable exposure. Currently, the Partnership is not aware of any such claims or contingent liabilities, which should be disclosed, or for which a provision should be established in the consolidated
	financial statements.
