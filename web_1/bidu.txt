	Our business is primarily conducted in China and almost all of our revenues are denominated in RMB. However, periodic reports
	made to shareholders will include current period amounts translated into U.S.&nbsp;dollars using the then current exchange rates, for the convenience of the readers. The conversion of RMB into U.S.&nbsp;dollars in this annual report is based on the
	noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers in RMB as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Board. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S.&nbsp;dollars and from U.S.&nbsp;dollars to RMB in this annual
	report were made at a rate of RMB6.4778 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect as of December 31, 2015. We make no representation that any RMB or U.S.&nbsp;dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S.&nbsp;dollars or RMB, as
	the case may be, at any particular rate, or at all. The PRC government imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of RMB into foreign exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade. On
	April&nbsp;1, 2016, the noon buying rate was RMB6.4776 to US$1.00.

	and user experience of the search results, availability and ease of use of products and services, the number of customers, distribution channels and the number of associated third-party websites/wapsites. For transaction services, our primary
	competitors include China-based internet companies such as Meituan-Dianping and Koubei. For iQiyi, our primary competitors include companies that operate online video websites in China, such as Youku-Tudou and Tencent Video. Some of our competitors
	have significant financial resources, long operating histories and are experienced in attracting and retaining users and managing customers. They may use their experience and resources to compete with us in a variety of ways, including by competing
	more heavily for users, customers, distributors, merchants, content, strategic partners and networks of third-party websites/wapsites, investing more heavily in research and development and making acquisitions. If any of our competitors provides

	also adversely affect us. For example, the number of people accessing the internet through mobile devices, including mobile phones, tablets and other hand-held devices, has increased in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue while 3G/4G
	and more advanced mobile communications technologies are broadly implemented. If we fail to develop products and technologies that are compatible with all mobile devices and operating systems, or if the products and services we develop are not
	widely accepted and used by users of various mobile devices and operating systems, our further penetration in the mobile internet market may be hindered. In addition, the widespread adoption of new internet, networking or telecommunications
	technologies or other technological changes could require substantial expenditures to modify or integrate our products, services or infrastructure. If we fail to keep up with rapid technological changes to remain competitive, or consequently fail to
	retain users with products and service of exceptional quality, our future success may be adversely affected.

	The number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones,

	In addition, the national networks in China are connected to the internet through international gateways controlled by the PRC government. These international gateways are the only channels through which a domestic user can connect to the internet.
	It is unpredictable whether a more sophisticated internet infrastructure will be developed in China. We may not have access to alternative networks in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with China&#146;s internet infrastructure. In

	Limited, or China Unicom, and China Mobile Communications Corporation, or China Mobile, to provide us with network services and data center hosting services. We have entered into contracts with various local branches or subsidiaries of China
	Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile to obtain data communications capacity. We have limited access to alternative services in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with the fixed telecommunications networks of these companies, or
	if these companies otherwise fail to provide the services. In May 2014, the service of our Baidu Cloud was inaccessible to some users for approximately four hours due to a failure of the internet infrastructure. In March 2015, our search services to
	some users were interrupted for over ten minutes as a result of a temporary malfunction of regional telecommunications infrastructure. Any unscheduled service interruption could damage our reputation and result in a decrease in our revenues.
	Furthermore, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by these telecommunication companies. If the prices that we pay for telecommunications and internet services rise significantly, our gross margins could be adversely affected.
	In addition, if internet access fees or other charges to internet users increase, our user traffic may decrease, which in turn may harm our revenues.

	arm&#146;s-length principles, Public Notice 16 specifies certain circumstances whereby such payments are not deductible for the purpose of the enterprise income tax of the PRC enterprise, including payments to an overseas related party which does
	not undertake any function, bear any risk or has no substantial operation or activities, payments for services which do not enable the PRC enterprise to obtain direct or indirect economic benefits, or for services that are unrelated to the functions
	and risks borne by the PRC enterprise, or relate to the protection of the investment interests of the direct or indirect investor of the PRC enterprise, or for services that have already been purchased from a third party or undertaken by the PRC
	enterprise itself, and royalties paid to an overseas related party which only owns the legal rights of the intangible assets but has no contribution to the creation of such intangible assets. Although we believe all our related party transactions,
	including all payments by our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities to our non-PRC entities, are made on an arm&#146;s-length basis and our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate decisions by the relevant tax authorities may differ
	from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.

	China&#146;s economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of
	government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the
	reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese
	government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China&#146;s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign
	currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or&nbsp;companies.

	Growth of China&#146;s economy has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy, and the rate of
	growth has been slowing. Since 2012, growth of the Chinese economy has slowed down. Some of the government measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of
	operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. Any stimulus measures designed to boost the Chinese economy may contribute to higher inflation, which could adversely affect our
	results of operations and financial condition. For example, certain operating costs and expenses, such as employee compensation and office operating expenses, may increase as a result of higher inflation. Additionally, because a substantial portion
	of our assets consists of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, high inflation could significantly reduce the value and purchasing power of these assets.

	government agencies issued a notice, or the Circular 13, prohibiting foreign investors from participating in online game operating businesses through wholly-owned enterprises, equity joint

	venture companies, entering into contractual arrangements with or providing technical support to the operating companies, or through a disguised form, such as incorporating user registration, user account management or payment through game cards

	online game companies which use the same or similar contractual arrangements as ours having been penalized or ordered to terminate operation by PRC authorities claiming that the contractual arrangements constitute control over, or participation in,
	the operation of online game operations through indirect means, it is unclear whether and how the various regulations of the PRC authorities might be interpreted or implemented in the future. If our relevant contractual arrangements were deemed to
	be &#147;indirect means&#148; or &#147;disguised form&#148; under the Circular 13, the relevant contractual arrangements may be challenged by the SAPPRFT or other governmental authorities. If we were found to be in violation of the Circular 13 to

	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment
	Law expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &#147;actual control&#148; in determining whether a company should be treated as a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. According to the definition set forth in the
	draft Foreign Investment Law, FIEs refer to enterprises established in China pursuant to PRC law that are solely or partially invested by foreign investors. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities established in China
	(without direct foreign equity ownership) but &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors, through contract or trust for example, will be treated as FIEs. Once an entity falls within the definition of FIE, it may be subject to foreign investment
	&#147;restrictions&#148; or &#147;prohibitions&#148; set forth in a &#147;negative list&#148; to be separately issued by the State Council later. If an FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry subject to foreign investment

	The Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-Raising and Round-Trip Investment Activities of
	Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or SAFE Circular No.&nbsp;75, and a series of implementation rules and guidance issued by SAFE, including the circular relating to operating procedures that came into effect in

	financing activities, and to update such registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to that offshore company. SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents&#146;
	Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the SAFE Circular No. 75. SAFE Circular No. 37 requires PRC residents to register with local
	branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents&#146; legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic
	enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular No. 37 as a &#147;special purpose vehicle.&#148; The term &#147;control&#148; under SAFE Circular No. 37 is broadly defined as the operation rights, beneficiary rights or
	decision-making rights acquired by the PRC residents in the offshore special purpose vehicles or PRC companies by such means as acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. SAFE Circular No. 37
	further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any changes with respect to the basic information of the special purpose vehicle, such as changes in a PRC resident individual shareholder, name or operation period; or any significant
	changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. If the shareholders of the offshore holding company
	who are PRC residents do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore
	company, and the offshore company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability

	The value of the RMB against the U.S.&nbsp;dollar and other currencies may

	On February 3, 2015, the State Administration of Tax issued a Public Notice
	Regarding Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfer of Properties by Non-Tax Resident Enterprises, or Public Notice 7. Public Notice 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698.
	Public Notice 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In
	addition, Public Notice 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities
	market. Public Notice 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an &#147;indirect transfer&#148;
	by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may
	report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a &#147;substance over form&#148; principle, the PRC tax authority may re-characterize such indirect transfer as a direct transfer of the equity interests in the PRC tax resident
	enterprise and other properties in China. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the
	applicable taxes, currently at a rate of up to 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the transferee may be subject to penalties under PRC tax laws if the transferee fails to withhold the taxes
	and the transferor fails to pay the taxes.

	We face uncertainties with respect to the reporting and consequences of

	non-PRC resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under Circular 698 and Public Notice 7. As a result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 and Public Notice 7 or to

	have the discretion under Circular 698 and Public Notice 7 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the taxable assets transferred and the cost of investment. If the PRC tax authorities make
	adjustments to the taxable income of the transactions under Circular 698 and Public Notice 7, our income tax costs associated with such transactions will be increased, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of

	In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for internet-related companies and companies with operations
	in China in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. The securities of some China-based companies that have listed their securities in the United States have experienced
	significant volatility since their initial public offerings in recent years, including, in some cases, substantial declines in the trading prices of their securities. The trading performances of these companies&#146; securities after their offerings
	may affect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies listed in the United States in general, which consequently may impact the trading performance of our ADSs, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news

	Link Analysis.
</I>
	&nbsp;Link analysis is a technique that determines the importance of a web page by evaluating the
	combination of the anchor texts and the number of web pages linked to that web page. We treat a link from web page&nbsp;A to web page&nbsp;B as a &#147;vote&#148; by page&nbsp;A in favor of page&nbsp;B. The subject of the &#147;vote&#148; is
	described in the anchor texts of that link. The more &#147;votes&#148; a web page gets, the higher the importance.

	Ranking.
</I>
	We compare search queries with the content of web pages to help determine relevance. We have significantly
	improved the relevancy and freshness of ranking using our machine learning modules to analyze the rich internet and user interaction data and prioritize the search results. For example, our technology determines the proximity of individual search
	terms to each other on a given web page, and prioritizes results where the search terms are near each other. Other aspects of a page&#146;s content are also considered. We have innovatively applied our machine learning technology to better
	understand the semantics beyond simple text of the keywords inputted by our users, allowing us to provide more relevant search results to users. Starting from 2013, we applied deep learning technology in our search ranking system, and such
	technology is playing an increasingly important role.

	frequency based on our knowledge of internet search users&#146; needs and the nature of the information. For example, our news index is typically updated every five minutes, and can be as frequent as every minute, throughout the day given the
	importance of timely information for news. We also mine multimedia and other forms of files from web page repositories.

	determined based on the relevance and certain other factors. The relevance is determined based on the analysis of past search and click-through results. Links to customers&#146; websites are ranked according to a comprehensive ranking index,
	calculated based on both the quality factor of a sponsored link for a search query and the price bid on that keyword. We employ a dynamic mechanism in determining the minimum bidding price for each keyword.

	Telecommunication Businesses promulgated by the MIIT. In order to acquire any equity interest in a value-added telecommunication business in China, a foreign investor must satisfy a number of stringent performance and operational experience
	requirements, including demonstrating good track records and experience in operating value-added telecommunication business overseas. Foreign investors that meet these requirements must obtain approvals from the MIIT and the Ministry of Commerce (or
	the Ministry of Commerce&#146;s authorized local counterparts), which retain considerable discretion in granting approvals. According to publicly available information, the PRC government has issued telecommunication business operating licenses to
	only a limited number of foreign-invested companies. We believe that it would be impracticable for us to acquire any equity interest in our consolidated affiliated entities without diverting management attention and resources. Moreover, we believe
	that our contractual arrangements with these entities and the individual nominee shareholders provide us with sufficient and effective control over these entities. Accordingly, we currently do not plan to acquire any equity interest in any of these

	Pursuant to SAFE&#146;s Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in
	Financing and Inbound Investment via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No.&nbsp;75, issued in October&nbsp;2005, and a series of implementation rules and guidance, including the circular relating to operating procedures that came

	SPV, for the purposes of overseas equity financing activities, and to update such registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to that offshore company. SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign
	Exchange Control on Domestic Residents&#146; Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the SAFE Circular No. 75. SAFE Circular No. 37
	requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents&#146; legally owned
	assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE No. Circular No. 37 as a &#147;special purpose vehicle.&#148; The term &#147;control&#148; under SAFE Circular No. 37 is broadly defined as the

	with respect to the basic information of the special purpose vehicle, such as changes in a PRC resident individual shareholder, name or operation period; or any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or
	decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. If the shareholders of the offshore holding company who are PRC residents do not complete their registration with the local
	SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and the offshore company may be restricted in its ability to
	contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. We
	have notified holders of ordinary shares of our company whom we know are PRC residents to register with the local SAFE branch and update their registrations as required under the SAFE regulations described above. After SAFE Notice 13 became
	effective on June 1, 2015, entities and individuals are required to apply for foreign exchange registration of foreign direct investment and overseas direct investment, including those required under the SAFE Circular No. 37, with qualified banks,
	instead of SAFE. The qualified banks, under the supervision of SAFE, directly examine the applications and conduct the registration. We are aware that Mr.&nbsp;Robin Yanhong Li, our chairman, chief executive officer and principal shareholder, who is
	a PRC resident, has registered with the relevant local SAFE branch. We, however, cannot provide any assurances that all of our shareholders who are PRC residents will file all applicable registrations or update previously filed registrations as
	required by these SAFE regulations. The failure or inability of our PRC resident shareholders to comply with the registration procedures may subject the PRC resident shareholders to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our cross-border investment
	activities, or limit our PRC subsidiaries&#146; ability to distribute dividends to or obtain foreign exchange-dominated loans from our company.

	In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic
	Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly-Listed Company, or the Stock Option Rule, replacing the earlier rules promulgated in March 2007. Under the Stock Option Rule, PRC residents who are granted stock options by an
	overseas publicly listed company are required, through a PRC agent or PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures. We and our PRC resident employees who have been granted stock
	options are subject to these regulations. We have designated our PRC subsidiary Baidu Online to handle the registration and other procedures required by the Stock Option Rule. Failure of the option holders to complete their SAFE registrations may
	subject these PRC employees to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit the ability of the overseas publicly listed company to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary and limit the PRC subsidiary&#146;s ability to distribute
	dividends.

	The Labor Contract Law, which became effective in January&nbsp;2008, and its implementation rules, impose more restrictions on
	employers and have been deemed to increase labor costs for employers, compared to the Labor Law, which became effective in January 1995. For example, pursuant to the Labor Contract Law, an employer is obliged to sign labor contract with unlimited
	term with an employee if the employer continues to hire the employee after the expiration of two consecutive fixed-term labor contracts. The employer has to compensate the employee upon the expiration of a fixed-term labor contract, unless the
	employee refuses to renew such contract on terms the same as or more favorable to the employee than those contained in the expired contract. The employer also has to indemnify an employee if the employer terminates a labor contract without a cause
	permitted by law. In addition, under the Regulations on Paid Annual Leave for Employees, which became effective in January&nbsp;2008, employees who have served more than one year for an employer are entitled to a paid vacation ranging from 5 to
	15&nbsp;days per year, depending on their length of service. Employees who waive such vacation time at the request of employers must be compensated for three times their regular salaries for each waived vacation day.

	Search Services
</I>
	. Search services are keyword-based marketing services targeted at and triggered by internet users&#146;

	A majority of our revenues from search services are derived from our P4P services. Our P4P platform is an online
	marketplace that introduces internet search users to customers who pay us a fee based on click-throughs for priority placement of their links in the search results. We recognize P4P revenues when a user clicks on a customer&#146;s link in the search
	results, based on the amount that the customer has agreed to pay for each click-through. Our P4P services revenues have primarily been driven by the increase in the number of page views, the increase in the number of P4P customers, and our success
	in optimizing the display of sponsored links. We believe that an increase in the number of active P4P customers generally leads to an increase in the number of sponsored links and a higher average price per click-through for selected keywords. Our
	P4P customer growth has primarily been driven by the adoption of our P4P services by SMEs and, to a lesser extent, large enterprises.

	We also provide our customers with other performance-based and display-based

	registered with our customers, or the number of minimum click-throughs. For display-based online marketing services, our customers pay us based on the duration or the number of display of the advertisement placed on our properties and Baidu Union

	customers&#146; online marketing budgets. We expect the number of our online marketing customers to grow and our customer mix may change. However, we expect our online marketing customer base to remain diverse for the foreseeable future. Any
	prolonged economic slowdown in China may cause our customers to decrease or delay their online marketing spending, hamper our efforts to grow our customer base, or result in fewer clicks by users on sponsored links or advertisements displayed on our

	amount of orders processed through Baidu Takeout Delivery platform. Baidu Takeout Delivery also generates delivery revenue by providing food distribution services to users.

	the value of confirmed orders of products and services, regardless of whether the products or services are consumed or delivered. The GMV generated by Qunar in the last three months of 2015 has been excluded from the total GMV in light of our

	. Traffic acquisition costs typically represent the portion of
	our online marketing revenues that we share with our Baidu Union members. We typically pay a Baidu Union member, based on a pre-agreed arrangement, a portion of the online marketing revenues generated from valid click-throughs by users of that

	.&nbsp;Bandwidth costs are the fees we pay to telecommunications carriers

	increasing traffic on our websites and mobile platform. Our bandwidth costs could also increase if the telecommunications carriers increase their service charges.

	relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from the reduced withholding tax rate on dividends due to a structure or arrangement designed for the primary purpose of obtaining favorable tax treatment, the PRC
	tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. Moreover, pursuant to a SAT Circular 601 issued by the State Administration of Taxation in October 2009, a resident of a contracting state will not qualify for the benefits under the tax
	treaties or arrangements, if it is not the &#147;beneficial owner&#148; with respect to dividend, interest and royalty income. According to SAT Circular 601, a &#147;beneficial owner&#148; shall have ownership and right to dispose of the income or
	the rights and properties giving rise to the income, and generally engages in substantive business activities. An agent or conduit company will not be regarded as a &#147;beneficial owner&#148; and, therefore, will not qualify for treaty benefits. A
	conduit company normally refers to a company that is set up primarily for the purpose of evading or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits. In August 2015, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Administrative Measures
	for Non-Resident Taxpayers to Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties, or SAT Circular 60, which became effective on November 1, 2015. SAT Circular 60 provides that non-resident enterprises are not required to obtain pre-approval from the relevant tax
	authority in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax rate. Instead, non-resident enterprises may, if they determine by self-assessment that the prescribed criteria to enjoy the tax treaty benefits are met, directly apply for the reduced
	withholding tax rate, and file necessary forms and supporting documents when performing tax filings, which will be subject to post-filing examinations by the relevant tax authorities.

	Our total revenues increased by 35.3% from RMB49.1 billion in 2014 to RMB66.4 billion

	This increase was mainly attributable to the increase in the number of our active online marketing customers from approximately 813,000 in 2014 to approximately 1,049,000 in 2015, and the increase in the average revenue per customer from
	approximately RMB59,400 in 2014 to approximately RMB60,500 (US$9,340) in 2015. Consistent with previously reported numbers, the number of active online marketing customers and average revenue per customer exclude those for our group-buying related

	Our total

	billion in 2013 to RMB48.5 billion in 2014. This increase was mainly attributable to the increase in the number of our active online marketing customers from approximately 753,000 in 2013 to approximately 813,000 in 2014, and the increase in the
	average revenue per customer from approximately RMB42,200 in 2013 to approximately RMB59,400 in 2014. The increase in our active online marketing customers was mainly due to our effective distribution network and our expanded direct sales. The
	increase in the average revenue per customer was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of paid clicks and the higher price per click as more customers participated in our P4P auction platform. Consistent with previously reported
	numbers, the number of active online marketing customers and average revenue per customer exclude those for our group-buying related businesses. The number of paid clicks increased by approximately 40.2% from 2013 to 2014.

	. Qunar&#146;s GMV in the first nine months of 2015 increased by 37.9% compared to that in 2014
	and significantly contributed to the growth of Qunar&#146;s service revenues. The increase of GMV was primarily attributable to the increase in estimated flight ticket, estimated hotel room night stayed volume and revenue per ticket. We have ceased
	consolidating the financial results of Qunar since October 26, 2015, when we completed a share exchange transaction with Ctrip pursuant to which we exchanged certain shares in Qunar for shares of Ctrip.

	&nbsp;The compensation committee of our board of directors administers our 2008&nbsp;share

	determine the provisions and terms and conditions of each award grant, including, but not limited to, the exercise price, the grant price or purchase price, any restrictions or limitations on the award, any schedule for lapse of forfeiture
	restrictions or restrictions on the exercisability of an award, and accelerations or waivers thereof, any provisions related to non-competition and recapture of gain on an award, based in each case on such considerations as the committee in its sole
	discretion determines. The compensation committee has the sole power and discretion to cancel, forfeit or surrender an outstanding award (whether or not in exchange for another award or combination or awards).

	&nbsp;Awards granted under our 2008&nbsp;share incentive plan are evidenced by an award agreement that

	&nbsp;We may grant awards to employees, directors and

	&nbsp;The outstanding awards will accelerate (i)

	(ii) upon occurrence of any other change-of-control corporate transaction in which the successor entity does not assume our outstanding awards under our 2008&nbsp;share incentive plan, provided that the plan participant remains an employee,
	consultant or member of our board of directors on the effective date of the corporate transaction. In such event, each outstanding award will become fully exercisable and all forfeiture restrictions on such award will lapse immediately prior to the

	exercisable. The compensation committee may also, in its sole discretion, upon or in anticipation of a corporate transaction, accelerate awards, purchase the awards from the plan participants, replace the awards, or provide for the payment of the

	all or part of an option may be exercised. At the time of grant for restricted share units, the compensation committee specifies the date on which the restricted share units become fully vested and non-forfeitable, and may specify such conditions to

	regulations. Any amendment, suspension or termination of our 2008&nbsp;share incentive plan must not adversely affect in any material way awards already granted without written consent of the recipient of such awards. Unless terminated earlier, our

	the ownership and disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares. This summary applies only to investors that are U.S.&nbsp;Holders (as defined below) and that hold the ADSs or ordinary shares as capital assets. This discussion is based on the tax laws

	Subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below, you will recognize gain or loss on any sale, exchange
	or other taxable disposition of an ADS or ordinary share equal to the difference between the amount realized for the ADS or ordinary share and your tax basis in the ADS or ordinary share. The gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss. If
	you are a non-corporate U.S.&nbsp;Holder, including an individual U.S.&nbsp;Holder, who has held the ADS or ordinary share for more than one year, you will generally be eligible for reduced tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject

	Most of our revenues and costs are denominated in RMB, while a portion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term financial
	assets, long-term loans payable and notes payable are denominated in U.S.&nbsp;dollars. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to those financial assets and financial liabilities denominated in U.S.&nbsp;dollars. Any significant
	revaluation of RMB against the U.S.&nbsp;dollar may materially affect our earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADS in U.S.&nbsp;dollars. See &#147;Item&nbsp;3.D. Key Information&#151;Risk

	capital injections into our Japan operation by converting U.S.&nbsp;dollars into Japanese Yen, we will be exposed to the fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S.&nbsp;dollar and the Japanese Yen. We have not hedged exposures denominated in

	NASDAQ Stock Market Rule&nbsp;5620 requires each issuer to hold an annual meeting of shareholders no later than one year after

	Cayman Islands counsel, has provided a letter to the NASDAQ Stock Market certifying that under Cayman Islands law, we are not required to hold annual shareholder meetings every year. We follow home country practice with respect to annual meetings
	and did not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2015. We may, however, hold annual shareholder meetings in the future if there are significant issues that require shareholders&#146; approvals.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Baidu, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014,
	and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s

	We conducted our audits in
	accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
	well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	We have audited Baidu, Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria established in
	Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Baidu, Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
	financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
	an opinion on the company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	We conducted our audit in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
	maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
	internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
	financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
	(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
	necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
	of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
	any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	In our opinion, Baidu, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31,
	2015, based on the COSO criteria.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
	(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Baidu, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the

	Through the design of the aforementioned agreements, the shareholders of the VIEs effectively assigned their full voting rights to Baidu
	Online, which gives Baidu Online the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs&#146; economic performance. Baidu Online obtains the ability to approve decisions made by the VIEs and the ability to acquire the equity
	interests in the VIEs when permitted by PRC law. Baidu Online is obligated to absorb a majority of the expected losses from the VIEs&#146; activities through providing unlimited financial support to the VIEs and is entitled to receive a majority of
	residual returns from the VIEs through the exclusive technology consulting and service fees. As a result of these contractual agreements, Baidu Online is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Despite the lack of technical majority
	ownership, there exists a parent-subsidiary relationship between the Company and the VIEs through these contractual agreements, and the Company consolidates the VIEs through Baidu Online.

	in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect; and (iii)&nbsp;the Group&#146;s business operations are in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations in all material respects.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could cause the Company&#146;s current ownership structure to be found in violation of any
	existing and/or future PRC laws or regulations and could limit the Company&#146;s ability, through the Primary Beneficiaries, to enforce its rights under these contractual arrangements. Furthermore, shareholders of the VIEs may have interests that
	are different with those of the Company, which could potentially increase the risk that they would seek to act in contrary to the terms of the aforementioned agreements.

	In addition, if the current structure or any of the contractual arrangements were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC law,
	the Company may be subject to penalties, which may include but not be limited to, the cancellation or revocation of the Company&#146;s business and operating licenses, being required to restructure the Company&#146;s operations or discontinue the
	Company&#146;s operating activities. The imposition of any of these or other penalties may result in a material and adverse effect on the Company&#146;s ability to conduct its operations. In such case, the Company may not be able to operate or

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Management evaluates estimates, including
	those related to the accounts receivable allowances, fair values of options to purchase the Company&#146;s or its subsidiaries&#146; ordinary shares, fair values of certain debt and equity investments, amortization and impairment of licensed
	copyrights, impairment of long-lived assets, long-term investments and goodwill, the purchase price allocation and fair value of noncontrolling interests with respect to business combinations and acquisition of equity method investees, and deferred
	tax valuation allowance, among others. Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
	assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

	had three reporting units, consisting of Qunar Cayman Islands Limited (&#147;Qunar&#148;), its online video business (&#147;iQiyi&#148;), and the rest of the Group. Immediately upon the change in segment reporting in the quarter ended June&nbsp;30,

	to the reporting units affected using a relative fair value allocation approach. However, as more fully described in Note 4, subsequent to the share exchange transaction with Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (&#147;Ctrip&#148;) the Company no longer

	than its carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test described above is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers primary factors such as industry and market
	considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations. In performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit
	to the fair value of the reporting unit based on either quoted market prices of the ordinary shares or estimated fair value using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
	carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Company must perform the
	second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation

	related description on the Company&#146;s search result list on the website which could be accessed through personal computer or mobile devices. Customers make bids on keywords based on how much they are willing to pay for each click to their
	listings in the search results listed on the Company&#146;s website and the relevance between the keywords and the customer&#146;s businesses. Internet users&#146; search of the keyword will trigger the display of the listings. The ranking of the

	eliminating the separate classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the consolidated balance sheet statement of financial position. The
	amendments in the update require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and

	recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within

	Equity Investment in Ctrip.
</I>
	On October&nbsp;26, 2015, the Company completed a share exchange transaction with Ctrip (&#147;Ctrip
	transaction&#148;), a company engaged in the online travelling business. The Company exchanged its beneficially owned 178,702,519 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and 11,450,000 Class B ordinary shares of its majority-owned subsidiary Qunar in exchange
	for 11,488,381 newly-issued ordinary shares of Ctrip. Subsequent to the transaction, the Company lost control over Qunar and owned 24.39% equity interests in Ctrip when combined with the Ctrip ADS previously acquired in the open market in 2013. The
	Company accounts for the investment in Ctrip as an equity method investment in accordance with ASC 323 due to its significant influence over the entity. The Company recorded the investment in Ctrip at the fair value of the shares acquired on the
	closing date of the Ctrip transaction. The Company recognized a total gain of RMB24.42 billion (US$3.77 billion) from the Ctrip transaction in &#147;Other income, net&#148; in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. The deconsolidation of Qunar did not meet the definition of a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC subtopic 205-20 (&#147;ASC 205-20&#148;),
<I>
	Presentation of Financial
	Statements
</I>
	&nbsp;&#150;
<I>
	&nbsp;Discontinued Operations
</I>
	, as the disposal of Qunar did not represent a shift in the Company&#146;s strategy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	Through this transaction, the Company strengthened its position in the online travelling business of the online to offline marketplace. The
	carrying amount of the Ctrip investment in excess of the Company&#146;s proportionate interest in Ctrip is recognized as equity method goodwill, intangible assets and related deferred income tax expenses.

	On June&nbsp;17, 2015, Qunar issued US$500.00 million senior unsecured convertible notes (the &#147;Qunar Notes&#148;) in a private placement.
	The Qunar Notes bear interest at a coupon rate of 2%&nbsp;per annum with a maturity date of June&nbsp;17, 2021. The Qunar Notes can be convertible at any time, at the holder&#146;s option, into Qunar ADSs, at an initial conversion price of US$55.00
	per Qunar ADS, subject to adjustment under the terms of the Qunar Notes. Upon conversion, Qunar shall pay or deliver its ADSs or cash, or any combination of cash and ADSs at the election of Qunar. Except for the other embedded features therein, the
	conversion option is eligible for a scope exception from derivative accounting under ASC 815. Qunar separated the Notes into equity component of RMB569.22&nbsp;million (US$87.87 million) and debt component of RMB2.53 billion (US$391.30 million) in
	accordance with the Cash Conversion Subsection under ASC subtopic 470-20 (&#147;ASC 470-20&#148;),
<I>
	Debt with Conversion and Other Options
</I>
	, so that Qunar recognizes the same interest cost as if it had issued a comparable debt instrument
	without the embedded conversion option. The equity component is measured as the residual amount, reflecting the interest cost paid with the conversion option. The allocated issuance costs to the debt component of RMB42.94 million (US$6.63 million)
	were presented as a direct deduction from the principal amount of the Qunar Notes. The Company evaluated all the other embedded derivative features therein and concluded all the other embedded derivative features are clearly and closely related to
	the debt host except for two features which require bifurcation from the debt host. The fair values of the two embedded derivative features were estimated to be insignificant as of the debt issuance date. Qunar was deconsolidated at the closing date
	of the Ctrip transaction (Note 4).

	Under the Japan tax laws, a company with paid-in capital in excess of JPY100 million was subject to a national corporate income tax rate of
	25.5% up to March&nbsp;31, 2015 and from April&nbsp;1, 2015 the income tax rate has been reduced to 23.9%. A company with paid-in capital equals JPY100 million or less will be taxed at a tax rate of 15% on first JPY8 million and at 23.9% on the

	Under the current EIT Law, dividends for earnings derived from January&nbsp;1, 2008 and onwards paid by PRC entities to any of their
	foreign non-resident enterprise investors are subject to a 10% withholding tax. A lower tax rate will be applied if tax treaty or arrangement benefits are available. Under the tax arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong, the reduced withholding
	tax rate for dividends paid by PRC entities is 5% provided the Hong Kong investors meet the requirements as stipulated by relevant PRC tax regulations, such as the beneficiary owner test. Capital gains derived from PRC are also subject to a 10% PRC
	withholding tax.

	Moreover, the current EIT Law treats enterprises established outside of China with &#147;effective management and
	control&#148; located in China as PRC resident enterprises for tax purposes. The term &#147;effective management and control&#148; is generally defined as exercising overall management and control over the business, personnel, accounting,
	properties, etc. of an enterprise. The Company, if considered a PRC resident enterprise for tax purposes, would be subject to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax at the rate of 25% on its worldwide income for the period after January&nbsp;1, 2008. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has not accrued for PRC tax on such basis. The Company will continue to monitor its tax status.

	reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to the Company. In addition, the Company entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each executive officer of the Company that provide
	for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by-laws and the indemnification agreements. The Company purchases

	The

	in these lawsuits may include awards of damages and may also result in, or even compel, a change in the Company&#146;s business practices, which could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise harm the business of the Company.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	For many proceedings, the Company is currently unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or a range of reasonably possible losses as the
	proceedings are in the early stages, and/or there is a lack of clear or consistent interpretation of laws specific to the industry-specific complaints among different jurisdictions. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing
	or ultimate resolution of such matters, which includes eventual loss, fine, penalty or business impact, if any, and therefore, an estimate for the reasonably possible loss or a range of reasonably possible losses cannot be made. However, the Company
	believes that such matters, individually and in the aggregate, when finally resolved, are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. With
	respect to the limited number of proceedings for which the Company was able to estimate the reasonably possible losses or the range of reasonably possible losses, such estimated loss amounts were insignificant.

	The operations of the Company are organized into three segments, consisting of the search services, transaction services,

	services provided by Baidu Nuomi, takeout delivery services and other online-to-offline services. iQiyi represents online video business.

	The Company derives the results of the segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The CODM measures the performance of
	each segment based on metrics of revenue and earnings from operations and uses these results to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to, each of the segments. The Company does not allocate any share-based compensation expenses and
	certain operating expenses to its segments as the CODM does not use this information to measure the performance of the operating segments. Because substantially all of the Group&#146;s long-lived assets and revenues are located in and derived from
	the PRC, geographical segments are not presented.

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,
</I>
	establishes a three-tier fair value

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	ASC 820 describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1)&nbsp;market approach; (2)&nbsp;income
	approach and (3)&nbsp;cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert
	future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an
	asset.

	In accordance with ASC 820, the Company measures available-for-sale investments at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values of the
	Company&#146;s held-to-maturity investments as disclosed are determined based on the discounted cash flow model using the discount curve of market interest rates. The fair value of the Company&#146;s long-term available-for-sale debt investment is
	measured using the market approach. The fair values of the Company&#146;s available-for-sale equity investments in the equity securities of publicly listed companies are measured using quoted market prices.

	The Company measures certain financial assets, including equity method investments and cost method investments, at fair value on a
	nonrecurring basis only if an impairment charge were to be recognized. The Company&#146;s non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, would be measured at fair value only if they were determined to be impaired on an

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, long-term available-for-sale debt investment represented investment in the
	redeemable preferred shares of a private company. As the preferred shares were redeemable at the option of the Company, the investment was classified as available-for-sale debt securities and measured at fair value. In June 2015, the redemption
	right was modified such that the preferred shares are only redeemable upon the occurrence of certain events out of the Company&#146;s control. The modification was accounted for as an extinguishment of the available-for-sale debt investment and any
	relevant unrealized gains/losses in other comprehensive income was recognized in earnings immediately upon reclassification to a cost method investment. Subsequent to the modification, the preferred shares were reclassified to cost method
	investments as the investment was not an in-substance common stock investment in a corporation and did not have a readily determinable fair value.
