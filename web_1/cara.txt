	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
	1995, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of
	Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; and &#147;Business,&#148; but are also contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the words &#147;anticipate,&#148;

	known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
	Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our

	According to IMS Health, an independent market research firm, the total U.S. market for pain
	management pharmaceuticals was $37.2 billion in 2015. The prescription pain management market in the United States is dominated by opioid analgesics, which, according to IMS Health data, represented 57% of the 433&nbsp;million analgesic
	prescriptions written in 2015 and accounted for sales of $9.1 billion in that year. Opioid analgesics decrease the perception of pain by stimulating mu, delta and/or kappa opioid receptors. All of these receptors are involved in modulating pain
	signals. The most widely used opioid analgesics, including hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl, act primarily through the activation of mu opioid receptors in the central nervous system, or CNS. However, because of the wide distribution
	of mu opioid receptors throughout the brain, morphine and other mu opioid analgesics also trigger a characteristic pattern of adverse &#147;central&#148; side effects, including nausea and vomiting, itching and respiratory depression. Mu opioids are
	also known to cause euphoria, which can lead to misuse, abuse and addiction issues.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our most advanced product candidate is based on our
	new chemical entity, CR845, which is designed to produce pain relief by specifically stimulating kappa, rather than mu, opioid receptors. We have designed CR845 with specific chemical characteristics to restrict its entry into the CNS and further
	limit CR845&#146;s mechanism of action to kappa opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system, which consists of the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. In addition to the side effects associated with activation of mu opioid receptors in
	the CNS, activation of kappa receptors in the CNS is also known to result in side effects, including acute psychiatric disorders. Since CR845 is designed to modulate pain signals without activation of mu or kappa opioid receptors in the CNS, it is
	not expected to produce the psychiatric side effects of centrally-active prior kappa opioids or the CNS related side effects of mu opioids. CR845 has been administered to over 700 human subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 clinical trials as an
	intravenous infusion, rapid intravenous injection or oral capsule or tablet and was considered to be safe and well tolerated in these clinical trials.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on the clinical trials and preclinical studies we have completed to date, we believe that product candidates based on CR845, if
	approved, will be attractive to both patients and physicians as a treatment for moderate-to-severe pain due to the following attributes:

	liking&#148; scores as measured by visual analog scale (VAS) Emax (p &lt;0.0001) when compared to pentazocine, an approved Schedule IV opioid receptor agonist. I.V. CR845 also demonstrated highly statistically significant lower &#147;feeling
	high,&#148; &#147;overall liking,&#148; and &#147;take drug again&#148; scores (p &lt;0.0001) as compared to pentazocine. Additionally, I.V. CR845 showed no &#147;drug liking&#148; dose response as both doses of I.V. CR845 were the same. Those
	scores represent standard subjective measures recommended by the FDA to assess a drug&#146;s abuse liability. We believe that the totality of the results from the HAL trial are supportive of the potential for CR845 to be the first non-scheduled or
	low (Schedule V) scheduled peripheral opioid for acute pain.

	In April 2015, we completed an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, to discuss the design of
	pivotal trials for our I.V. CR845 product candidate in acute pain. In September 2015, we initiated the Phase 3 program for our I.V. formulation of CR845 in postoperative pain with the dosing of the first subjects in an adaptive pivotal trial in
	patients undergoing a range of abdominal surgeries (see
<I>

	In February 2016, the FDA advised us that our adaptive pivotal trial of I.V. CR845 for postoperative pain had been placed on IND clinical hold
	pending a safety review. The clinical hold was based on a stopping rule related to elevated serum sodium levels of greater than 150 mmol/L that was included in the clinical trial protocol. Four patients out of 90 total patients dosed to date, all of
	whom were in the highest I.V. CR845 dose group (5 ug/kg), exhibited transient serum sodium levels equal to or greater than 150 mmol/L (mild-to-moderate hypernatremia). All four patients were asymptomatic and sodium levels resolved to normal levels
	(less than 146 mmol/L) within 24 hours post-dosing with standard fluid management. No patients in the other two dose groups (2 ug/kg and 1 ug/kg) exhibited serum sodium levels greater than 150 mmol/L. A review of unblinded safety data has been
	undertaken by both us and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee in accordance with the clinical trial protocol.

	The most common
	adverse events (&gt; 5%) reported across treatment groups and placebo so far were nausea, hypernatremia, abdominal distension and procedural hypotension. All cases of abdominal distension and procedural hypotension were attributed to the surgical
	procedure and not to the dosing of I.V. CR845. There were no cases of respiratory depression, no adverse events greater than Grade 1, and no CR845-associated serious adverse events have been reported. We anticipate continuing the trial following FDA
	review of the patient safety data and removal of the clinical hold.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on previous guidance from the FDA, we believe we will require
	1,500 total exposures to I.V. CR845, including all Phase&nbsp;1, Phase&nbsp;2 and Phase&nbsp;3 trials, prior to submitting a new drug application, or NDA. We believe our planned clinical trials and our clinical trials completed to date will result

	In August 2015, we advanced our tablet formulation of Oral CR845 into a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with osteoarthritis, or OA, of the
	knee or hip. In December 2015, we announced positive top-line results from this Phase 2a trial. The results showed a dose-related reduction in mean baseline pain score up to 34% after two weeks, with a statistically significant reduction in mean
	rescue medication for the top 5.0 mg dose group of approximately 80%. See the section titled &#147;Our Product Candidates &#150; Oral CR845&#148;, below, for details of this Phase 2a OA trial. We plan to initiate a double-blind, multiple dose Phase
	2b clinical trial of Oral CR845 in the second half of 2016. The Phase 2b trial will include twice-daily doses of three tablet strengths of Oral CR845 or placebo over an eight-week treatment period in patients with moderate-to-severe pain associated

	prevalence in dialysis patients, for which there are no approved therapeutics in the United States. In July 2015, we reported positive top-line efficacy results from Part B of this Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, in which we observed that I.V. CR845

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pain is generally categorized by its duration as either acute or chronic, by its severity, as mild, moderate or severe, and its type and/or
	causality, such as postoperative or neuropathic. Acute pain is typically caused by an injury resulting in nerve, tissue or bone damage and is expected to subside in severity when the injury heals. Postoperative pain is a subset of the acute pain
	market. Chronic pain, on the other hand, is prolonged, and can be the long-term result of an acute injury or an ongoing disease condition, such as neuropathic pain associated with diabetes. According to a recent Institute of Medicine report, chronic
	pain affects approximately 100&nbsp;million U.S. adults, while millions of others experience acute pain caused by events such as surgery, injury, childbirth and illness. According to IMS Health, the total U.S. market for pain management
	pharmaceuticals was $37.2 billion in 2015. In 2012, according to Visiongain, an independent industry research company, total sales for pain therapies worldwide, exceeded $63 billion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The severity of pain is the key factor in determining the appropriate therapy. Mild or mild-to-moderate pain is generally treated with
	non-opioid products, such as oral formulations of NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen), aspirin, and acetaminophen. Moderate-to-severe pain, on the other hand, is typically treated with products containing traditional mu opioids. Mu opioid analgesics
	are effective to some degree for many patients, but have a poor side effect and abuse liability profile, which limits or precludes their use in treating less severe pain. For many people with moderate-to-severe pain, opioid analgesics are the only
	effective method of treating pain. As a result, these opioid analgesics are among the largest prescription drug classes in the United States. According to IMS Health, opioid analgesics represented approximately 57% of the nearly 433&nbsp;million
	analgesic prescriptions written in 2015, accounting for $9.1 billion in sales.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	According to recently updated Practice Guidelines developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the standard of care for treating
	acute postoperative pain is multimodal analgesia, which includes the administration of two or more drugs that act by different mechanisms for providing analgesia in a manner that will minimize the occurrence of adverse events. When patients are
	ready for discharge, a transition is typically made to a prescription oral pain medication, allowing patients to self-administer relatively strong analgesics after being discharged home. This transition from an I.V. pain medication to an oral pain
	medication is commonly referred to as I.V.-to-oral &#147;step-down&#148; therapy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Strong mu opioid analgesics, such as morphine,
	fentanyl, and hydromorphone, are mainstays of pain treatment in the immediate postoperative period, and are used as part of a multimodal analgesic approach. However, the use of strong mu opioid analgesics is associated with an array of unwanted and
	serious side effects, including postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression, or POIRD, postoperative nausea and vomiting, or PONV, and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, or OBD, which contributes to the severity of postoperative ileus, or
	POI. According to Anesthesiology News
<I>
	,
</I>
	a trade journal, the incidence of POIRD may be as high as 29%, can occur unexpectedly in even the healthiest of patients, and exerts a disproportionately high toll on length of stay and hospital costs
	due to the significant expenses associated with the treatment of POIRD. According to an article published in Best Practice&nbsp;&amp; Research Clinical Anaesthesiology, a trade journal, PONV occurs in approximately one-third of surgical patients
	overall, and is one of the most important factors in determining length of stay after surgery, resulting in estimated annual costs in the U.S. in the range of $1 billion. These mu opioid-related adverse events not only significantly increase the
	cost of care, but also reduce a patient&#146;s quality of care and lead to sub-optimal recovery.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Nonopioid analgesics formulated for
	injection or infusion, including I.V. acetaminophen and NSAIDs, such as I.V. ibuprofen, are available as alternatives to mu opioids to relieve acute pain, but their use is limited in a postoperative care setting as a result of their limited
	efficacy. I.V. acetaminophen and NSAIDs also have side effects that limit their use at higher, more efficacious doses. Acetaminophen is associated with risk of liver toxicity, which can be fatal, and NSAIDs are associated with risks of bleeding,

	The most
	common causes of moderate-to-severe chronic pain are musculoskeletal problems and inflammatory conditions. Injuries from accidents resulting in fractures, dislocations or soft tissue injury, as well as lower back pain, are the most frequent causes
	of musculoskeletal pain. Although these injuries are mostly non-fatal, the cost in terms of long-term disability, medical expense and lost productivity is large. Moderate-to-severe chronic pain is typically treated with prescription products
	including immediate release and long-acting opioids, such as the branded products OxyContin (oxycodone), Nucynta ER (tapentadol) and Opana ER (oxymorphone), and combination products that include an opioid combined with an NSAID or acetaminophen,
	such as the branded products Vicodin (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) and Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen). Prescription products for chronic pain are usually in oral tablet or capsule form because the vast majority of these patients are taking
	these medications outside of the hospital setting.

	On April&nbsp;7, 2005, the FDA announced a decision to require boxed warnings of
	potential cardiovascular risk for all NSAIDs. The 2005 FDA warning related to cardiovascular adverse events associated with NSAIDs and the increased awareness of the risk of liver toxicity associated with high doses of acetaminophen have led to
	increased use of mu opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the use of mu opioid analgesics carries significant additional risks. Chronic opioid use causes patients to develop tolerance for the opioid, which results in the
	patient needing increasing opioid doses to achieve the same level of pain relief. For the most commonly prescribed analgesic combination products, the need for increasing doses to achieve the same level of pain relief means exposure to increasing
	amounts of NSAIDs or acetaminophen, which carry the risks attendant to these therapeutics. Moreover, due to their CNS activity, mu opioids produce feelings of euphoria, which can give rise to abuse and addiction. Underlining the severity of this
	issue, in September 2013, the FDA announced class-wide safety labeling changes and new post-market study requirements for all extended-release and long-acting mu opioid

	Despite the size of the pain management market, there has been little innovation in the development of new analgesics, with nearly all recent
	new drug approvals limited to reformulations and improved methods of delivery of existing therapeutics. Mu opioids continue to be the most prescribed drugs for pain management, despite their side effects and the potential for misuse, abuse and
	addiction. These concerns often cause healthcare providers to administer or prescribe less than optimal doses of mu opioids, or patients to take lower than prescribed doses, resulting in inadequate pain relief. Consequently, we believe that the pain
	market represents a therapeutic area with substantial unmet needs for patients in pain, for physicians who must balance pain control with risks of causing severe adverse events, and for healthcare organizations that bear the costs of managing the
	consequences of undertreated pain and drug-related adverse events. We believe that CR845, with its novel mechanism of action, will be attractive to patients and physicians, as well as hospitals and payers, as a treatment for moderate-to-severe pain
	because of its ability to provide pain relief without opioid-related adverse events or abuse and addiction issues associated with currently approved mu opioid analgesics.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pruritus, or itch, is defined as an unpleasant sensation that provokes the desire to scratch. Certain systemic diseases have been known to
	cause pruritus that ranges in intensity from a mild annoyance to an intractable, disabling condition. The sensation of pruritus is transmitted through slow-conducting unmyelinated C-polymodal and possibly type A delta nociceptive neurons with free
	nerve endings located near the dermoepidermal junction or in the epidermis. These neurons appear to be located more superficially and are more sensitive to pruritogenic substances than pain receptors. Activators of these nerves include histamine,
	neuropeptide substance P, serotonin, bradykinin, proteases (e.g., mast cell tryptase), and endothelin (which stimulates the release of nitric oxide). Impulses are transmitted from the dorsal root ganglion to the spinothalamic tract. Additionally,
	opioids are known to modulate the sensation of pruritus, both peripherally and centrally. Stimulation of mu opioid receptors accentuates pruritus, while stimulation of kappa receptors suppress pruritus.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pruritus may be classified into the following categories on the basis of the underlying causative disease: renal or uremic pruritus,
	cholestatic pruritus, hematologic pruritus, endocrine pruritus, pruritus related to malignancy, dermatological pruritus and idiopathic generalized pruritus. According to a study Cara conducted with IMS Health utilizing medical claims data from 2013,
	nearly 45&nbsp;million patients have been diagnosed with diseases known to trigger pruritus in the United States alone. Of those patients, nearly half (47%)&nbsp;or 21&nbsp;million received a prescription for an anti-pruritic agent such as
	corticosteroids, antihistamines, select antidepressants, counterirritants, bile acid sequestrants, rifampin, narcotic antagonists and partial agonists, topical immunomodulators (Elidel, Protopic) or gabapentin.

	Our most advanced product candidate, I.V. CR845, is an injectable version of our first-in-class, peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonist,
	which is intended for the treatment of acute pain in an acute care setting. I.V. CR845 is designed to provide pain relief without stimulating mu opioid receptors and therefore without mu opioid-related side effects, such as nausea, vomiting,
	respiratory depression and euphoria.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	I.V. CR845 has been well tolerated and demonstrated consistent efficacy in three randomized,
	double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials. Two of these trials were in patients undergoing a laparoscopic hysterectomy, a soft tissue surgical procedure, and a third trial was in patients undergoing a bunionectomy, a hard tissue
	surgical procedure. I.V. CR845 administration resulted in statistically significant reductions in pain intensity, as measured by the sum of pain intensity difference, or SPID, the FDA-recommended endpoint. In addition, in both surgical models, I.V.
	CR845 exhibited an ability to decrease the opioid-related adverse events, or AEs, of nausea and vomiting associated with current therapies with no evidence of drug-related respiratory depression. According to research conducted at Duke University,
	post-operative AEs associated with currently approved opioids, such as nausea and vomiting, increase the length of time that a patient spends in the hospital and increases the cost of caring for those patients. Therefore, we believe that I.V. CR845
	has the potential to significantly reduce the length of hospital stays, thereby reducing overall healthcare costs.

	The safety profile of
	I.V. CR845 has been documented in nine clinical trials, including six Phase 1 and three Phase 2 studies. In these trials, CR845 was administered to approximately 500 human subjects at single or repeat doses ranging from 1mcg/kg to 40 mcg/kg up to a
	1 week period, in the form of I.V. infusion or I.V. bolus injection. I.V. CR845 was considered to be generally safe and well tolerated in all of these clinical trials. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, across evaluated
	populations were transient facial tingling or numbness, dizziness and fatigue. In addition, a transient increase in urine output in the absence of electrolyte loss, otherwise known as aquaresis, was also observed, which in some subjects was
	accompanied by asymptomatic elevations in plasma sodium that were generally considered to be clinically unimportant. No clinically significant changes in electrocardiogram characteristics have been observed in any of these studies. Importantly,
	there appeared to be no cases of the characteristic CNS-related adverse events, such as acute psychiatric side effects, typically observed with prior-generation CNS-active kappa agonists.

	to or greater than 150 mmol/L (mild-to-moderate hypernatremia). All four patients were asymptomatic and sodium levels resolved to normal levels (less than 146 mmol/L) within 24 hours post-dosing with standard fluid management. No patients in the

	&gt;4 on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale, or NRS, at baseline. Patients discontinued current pain medications five days prior to baseline measurements. Four tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 5.0 mg) were administered twice a day over
	a two-week treatment period in a total of 80 OA patients enrolled at five sites in the U.S. (Figure 1). In addition to safety and PK observations, CR845&#146;s effectiveness was assessed by: change from baseline in joint pain using the NRS, which
	was measured daily, change from baseline in the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index, or WOMAC, which was measured at the end of Weeks 1 and 2 of treatment, change from baseline in rescue medication use, measured daily, and Patient
	Global Assessment, or PGA, which was measured on the last day of the study. Acetaminophen was the only allowable rescue medication. PK analyses indicated dose-proportional exposure of CR845 after oral administration, with the 5.0 mg dose group

	or &#147;much improved&#148; as indicated by patient global assessment (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, p=0.02, 2-sided). In this trial, all four tablet strengths were observed to be safe and well tolerated. The Phase 2a trial establishes therapeutic

	In addition to our CR845 family of peripheral kappa agonists, we have discovered and are developing lead molecules that selectively modulate
	peripheral cannabinoid receptors. Studies on the effects of cannabis have led to the discovery of an endogenous system of ligands in humans involved in a number of physiological processes, including pain and inflammation. The main naturally
	occurring ligands for this system, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), activate a number of cannabinoid receptors, including CB1 and CB2 receptors. Like opioid receptors, CB1 and CB2 receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor
	superfamily. CB1 receptors and associated ligands are mainly localized in the brain, whereas CB2 receptors are found mainly in peripheral tissues, particularly immune cells such as leukocytes and mast cells, which have been shown to be involved in
	pain and inflammatory responses. We are developing lead molecules that selectively modulate peripheral CB receptors without targeting CNS cannabinoid receptors. Our most advanced CB compound, CR701, is a peripherally-restricted, mixed-CB1/CB2
	receptor agonist that selectively interacts with these cannabinoid receptor subtypes, with no off-target activities. The compound is orally bioavailable, active in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and does not produce the
	side effects characteristic of centrally-active cannabinoids, such as sedation and hypothermia. Accordingly, CR701 would be expected to have substantially less abuse potential than centrally-active cannabinoids, but retain activity against
	therapeutically valuable peripheral targets, similar in principle to CR845.

	reported positive top-line dose-ranging PK and safety data from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of I.V. CR845 for the treatment of uremic pruritus. In July 2015, we reported positive top-line efficacy results from this trial, in which we observed

	In the

	cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States
	jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. Although we

	The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis

	There are a large number of companies developing or marketing pain therapies for the indications that we
	are pursuing. Many of our competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates,
	obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller
	number of competitors. Small or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We also compete with these companies in recruiting and

	We believe
	the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and
	reimbursement from government and third party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more
	convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors
	establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic
	products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates
	achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.

	among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Manufacture of drug substance, drug product and the labeling and distribution of clinical supplies must all comply with cGMP standards. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is
	submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case,
	the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

</B>
	Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the
	supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are
	conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol
	amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must
	continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their
	ClinicalTrials.gov website.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
	In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial
	indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted
	diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough
	data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious
	adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various
	grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in
	accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

	Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed
	labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the
	Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application.

	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess
	the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its
	own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.

	The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days
	after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application
	must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA
	reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s continued safety, quality

	The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of
	independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of
	an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

	Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically
	will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with
	cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to
	complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely
	basis, or at all.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and
	inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions
	that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may
	decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of
	the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required.

	Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or

	programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the
	product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications,
	manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

	Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA
	approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse
	experiences with the product, and compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization. After approval, most
	changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which
	such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to
	register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are
	strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any
	third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

	The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I
	substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk

	Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The

	The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security
	requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through
	measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II
	controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying,
	soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or
	service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements
	between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Practices
	that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a
	particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative

	Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was also amended by the

	false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal
	government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#147;any request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to
	the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use
	of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug&#146;s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services

	person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal
	statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the

	Coverage and Reimbursement Generally

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in
	part on the extent to which governmental payer programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our
	product candidates. In the United States, private health insurers and other third party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid
	programs for such products and services. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate
	the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in
	the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of
	operations. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient
	programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare
	reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Patients who are prescribed treatments for their
	conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. In addition, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for
	certain surgeries and other treatment therapies they perform, or a predetermined rate for all hospital inpatient care provided as payment in full. Because this amount may not be based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs, hospitals may choose
	to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our product candidates. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by
	health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers.
	Third-party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products, including pharmaceuticals. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered
	prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an
	approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Additionally, third-party payers are increasingly

	expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary
	or cost-effective. Moreover, a payer&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved, and one payer&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure
	that other payers will also provide coverage. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative proposals to
	reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that
	healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape with respect to healthcare continues to evolve. There have been
	a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting
	changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly
	affected by major legislative initiatives.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For example, the Health Care Reform Law was passed in March 2010 and includes provisions that
	have substantially changed healthcare financing by both governmental and private insurers. Among other provisions that could have an impact on our business, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, revised the methodology by which rebates
	owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,
	extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals&nbsp;enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided
	incentives to programs that increase the federal government&#146;s comparative effectiveness research. Additionally, the Health Care Reform Law implemented a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to
	offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D. The Health Care Reform
	Law&#146;s full impact on our business is unclear as many of its reforms require the promulgation of additional detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet completely occurred. Further, there have been judicial and
	Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments in the future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. In August 2011, the
	President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit
	Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions
	to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year starting in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect until 2025, unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013,
	President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to
	providers from three to five years. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare payments and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We
	expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the
	prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our product candidates once they are approved.

	In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other

	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.
	For the last several years, we have focused our efforts primarily on developing I.V. and Oral CR845 with the goal of achieving regulatory approval. We are presently on IND clinical hold for I.V. CR845. Since inception, we have incurred significant
	operating and net losses available to common stockholders. Our net losses available to common stockholders were $24.7 million, $17.7 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31,
	2013, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $104.9 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating and net losses over the next several years, as we continue to develop I.V. and Oral
	CR845 and our other product candidates. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, the receipt of additional milestone payments, if any, under our collaborations with Maruishi and

	To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This
	will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, discovering additional product candidates, potentially entering into collaboration and
	license agreements, obtaining regulatory approval for product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may

	We currently

	We initiated the first pivotal clinical trial for I.V. CR845 in acute pain in the third quarter of 2015. As described elsewhere in this
	report, in February 2016, the FDA placed the trial on IND clinical hold pending a safety review following the triggering of a stopping rule in the trial protocol. In addition to this clinical development, I.V. CR845 will require regulatory approval,
	commercial manufacturing arrangements, establishment of a commercial organization, significant marketing efforts and further investment before we generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product
	candidates, including I.V. CR845, before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. If we do not receive FDA approval
	for, and successfully commercialize, I.V. CR845, we will not be able to generate revenue from I.V. CR845 in the United States in the foreseeable future, or at all. Any significant delays in obtaining approval for and commercializing I.V. CR845 will

	I.V. CR845 has completed three Phase 2 clinical trials and has begun its Phase 3 clinical trial program, it is, nonetheless, susceptible to the risks of failure inherent at any stage of product development, including the appearance of unexpected
	adverse events or failure to achieve its primary endpoints in subsequent clinical trials, including our planned Phase 3 clinical trials. Further, our product candidates, including I.V. CR845, may not receive regulatory approval even if they are

	The
	development of product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonists is an emerging field, and the scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop product candidates that work through this mechanism
	are relatively recent. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing differentiated product candidates based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. We believe that we are amongst a relatively small group of
	companies that are pursuing the development of product candidates based on peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonists. In addition, we believe that companies that previously explored the development of kappa opioid receptor agonists
	abandoned these efforts because those prior generation kappa agonists, which were centrally active, resulted in psychiatric side effects. Although CR845 is a peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonist and these side effects have not been
	observed in any of our clinical trials to date, it is possible that we could observe similar side effects, or other unacceptable adverse events. As a result, our approach to developing product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor
	agonists may not be successful and may never lead to marketable products.

	Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on developing product candidates for specific indications that we identify

	approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory
	authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate&#146;s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have
	not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates, including I.V. CR845 and Oral CR845, or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future, will ever obtain

	Undesirable side effects caused by our product
	candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to limit dosage in development or interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable
	foreign authorities. For example, in February 2016, the FDA placed our adaptive pivotal trial of I.V. CR845 for postoperative pain on IND clinical hold pending a safety review. The clinical hold was based on a stopping rule related to elevated serum
	sodium levels of greater than 150 mmol/L. There can be no guarantee that the FDA will remove this clinical hold promptly or at all. If other concerns are raised regarding the safety of a new drug as a result of undesirable side effects identified

	making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the drug. The number of such requests for additional data or information issued by the FDA in recent years has increased, and resulted in substantial delays in the approval of several new
	drugs. Undesirable side effects caused by I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates could also result in denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or the inclusion of
	unfavorable information in our product labeling, and in turn prevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale of I.V. CR845 or any other product candidate.

	To date, the side effects observed in the completed I.V. CR845 clinical trials include dizziness, transient facial tingling, a state of
	near-sleep, or somnolence, and hypernatremia, an electrolyte disturbance that is defined by an elevated sodium level in the blood, which we believe is secondary, at least in part, to another side effect, aquaresis, that is defined as
	electrolyte-free urination. As described above, the observation of mild to moderate hypernatremia in our ongoing adaptive pivotal trial for postoperative pain triggered a stopping rule in the trial protocol and led the FDA to institute an IND
	clinical hold related to the trial, pending a safety review. Prolonged aquaresis can result in a negative fluid balance if the excreted water is not replaced by oral or intravenous fluids, and although we recommend steps to control fluid balance, we
	cannot be certain that such instructions will be followed by healthcare providers and/or patients, and failure to follow such instructions may be accompanied by adverse events associated with negative fluid balance, including disability and death.
	We believe that one such adverse event, which has been observed, postural tachycardia, an elevation of heart rate upon standing up, is a physiological reflex that can be triggered as a result of decreased intravascular volume caused by a negative
	fluid balance. We have observed transient prolactin elevations, which are brief increases in the concentration of the hormone prolactin in the bloodstream, in response to I.V. CR845, which we have measured as a nonselective opioid biomarker since
	both kappa and mu opioids elicit this effect. We cannot be certain that such elevations in prolactin will be transient, safe, and well tolerated in all patients. In addition, kappa opioid agonists, the class of drugs that I.V. CR845 belongs to, have
	been associated with poorly tolerated psychiatric side effects, such as a feeling of emotional and mental discomfort, or dysphoria, and hallucinations, at high doses,

	In addition, currently approved mu opioids with which CR845-based products may compete are controlled substances, which are subject to state,
	federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution. Controlled substances are regulated under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and regulations of the DEA.
	The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as
	Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.

	Various states also independently

	commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our collaborators may also be requested to obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and

	Regulations associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement

	Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and

	hospital, or formulary list.&nbsp;In evaluating drugs for inclusion on the formulary list, hospitals evaluate a variety of factors, including cost.&nbsp;The frequency with which hospitals add and remove drugs from their formulary lists varies from
	hospital to hospital, and hospitals often require additional information prior to adding new drugs to their formulary, which may result in substantial delays in our receiving formulary approval for I.V. CR845.&nbsp;Since most hospitals are members

	Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant

	and may be slow to adopt it as an accepted treatment of pain. It is unlikely that any labeling approved by the FDA will contain claims that one of our product candidates is safer or more effective than competitive products or will permit us to
	promote such product candidate as being superior to competing products. Further, the availability of inexpensive generic forms of pain management products for acute pain and over-the-counter alternatives for chronic pain may also limit acceptance of

	may not generate meaningful revenues from I.V. CR845, or such other product candidate, and we may not become profitable.

	We rely on third-party CROs
	to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials for all of our product candidates, and do not plan to independently conduct clinical trials of any other potential product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs,
	clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. These agreements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third
	parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that would delay our product development activities and adversely affect our business.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our reliance on these third parties for development activities will reduce our control over these activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible
	for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will
	remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical trials are conducted in accordance with GLP, as
	appropriate. Moreover, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to
	assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors,
	clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us
	to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP
	regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.
	We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse
	publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.

	Our CROs may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our
	competitors. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, non-clinical
	and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated
	protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be

	We do not manufacture any of our product candidates, and we do not currently plan to develop any capacity to do so. We do not yet have
	agreements established regarding commercial supply of our product candidates and may not be able to establish or maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms for I.V. CR845, if approved, or any of our other product
	candidates, for which we obtain approval in the future. Any problems or delays we experience in preparing for commercial-scale manufacturing of a product candidate may result in a delay in FDA approval of the product candidate or may impair our
	ability to manufacture commercial quantities, which would adversely affect our business. For example, our manufacturers will need to produce specific batches of our product candidates to demonstrate acceptable stability under various conditions and
	for commercially viable lengths of time. We and our contract manufacturers will need to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory authorities this acceptable stability data for our product candidates, as well as validate methods and manufacturing
	processes, in order to receive regulatory approval to commercialize I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates. Furthermore, if our commercial manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of bulk drug substance or finished
	product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues.

	We only have one contract manufacturer for each of I.V. CR845 and Oral CR845 for use in our clinical trials; Polypeptide for I.V. CR845 and
	Enteris for Oral CR845. In addition, we do not have any long-term commitments from our suppliers of clinical trial material or guaranteed prices for our product candidates. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise
	and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production. These
	problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal,
	state and foreign regulations. Our manufacturers may not perform as agreed. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide product candidates to patients in our clinical trials would be jeopardized.

	Further, we may rely on proprietary technology developed by our contract manufacturers for purposes of manufacturing certain of our product
	candidates and our failure to negotiate the long term use of any such proprietary technology may lead to delays or interruptions in the regulatory approval or commercialization process, as well as increased costs. For example, we have developed a
	formulation of Oral CR845 based on proprietary technology of Enteris. Under our agreement with Enteris, it is providing to us clinical supplies for an oral tablet formulation of CR845 on a fee for service basis. Under the agreed scope of work for
	this agreement, Enteris is using its proprietary formulation technology for oral delivery of peptides to provide a tablet formulation of CR845 with suitable characteristics to use in clinical testing. We have not yet negotiated terms related to our
	use of such technology for commercial manufacturing of Oral CR845 and we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to enter into an agreement to use such proprietary technology, we may be forced to reformulate
	Oral CR845 which could result in significantly delaying commercializing Oral CR845 and require us to incur additional costs in connection with such reformulation and potentially needed to seek additional approvals from the FDA.

	In addition, all manufacturers of our product candidates must comply with cGMP requirements

	Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe
	harbors available under these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies continue to be prosecuted under the federal false
	claims laws for numerous activities, including those related to research, sales, marketing and promotional programs. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law among other
	things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain other criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in
	order to commit a violation. Moreover, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent
	claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. To the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of
	the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or
	state health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business
	and our financial results. Although an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even
	if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#146;s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state
	privacy, security, transparency and fraud and abuse laws may prove costly. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with
	applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including but not limited to, exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business.

	If the government or other third-party payers fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement and payment rates for I.V. CR845 or

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our future products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from
	third-party payers. Such third-party payers include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards
	that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate. In
	particular, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for certain surgeries and other treatment therapies they perform, or a predetermined rate for all hospital inpatient care provided as payment in full. Because this
	amount may not be based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs, hospitals may choose to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our product candidates. Accordingly, I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates, if approved,
	will face competition from other therapies and drugs for these limited hospital financial resources. We may need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to the satisfaction of
	hospitals, other target customers and their third-party payers. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective.
	Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Third-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of
	controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from
	payer to payer. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products or product
	candidates for which we receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

	We expect that the Health Care Reform Law, as well as
	other federal and state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in
	reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. In addition, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among
	other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. The implementation of cost containment measures or

	product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product.&nbsp;The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by
	manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically.&nbsp;Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers&#146; products are appropriately licensed.&nbsp;Further, under this new legislation,
	manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen,&nbsp;and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of

	In international markets, reimbursement and health care payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have
	instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing
	negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial
	that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be
	available or that the third-party payers&#146; reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at
	unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.

	Our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates depends upon our ability to avoid
	infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and our commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies
	without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which
	are owned by third parties, exist in the general field of pain management and cover the use of numerous compounds and formulations in our targeted markets. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents
	that may be granted in the future. Because of the uncertainty inherent in any patent or other litigation involving proprietary rights, we and our licensors may not be successful in defending intellectual property claims by third parties, which could
	have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation, defending the litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management. In addition, because patent applications can take many
	years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that I.V. CR845 or our other product candidates may infringe. There could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that
	I.V. CR845 or our other product candidates may inadvertently infringe.

	interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be
	commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.

	If I.V. CR845 is approved by the FDA, one or more third parties may challenge
	the patents covering this product candidate, which could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims. For example, if a third party files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, for a
	generic drug product containing CR845, and relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by or for us, the third party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1)&nbsp;there is no patent information listed in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book
	with respect to our NDA for I.V. CR845; (2)&nbsp;the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (3)&nbsp;the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4)&nbsp;the
	listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the third-party&#146;s generic drug product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the Orange Book-listed patents for CR845, or that such patents
	are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification. If the third party submits a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third-party&#146;s ANDA is accepted for filing by
	the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45&nbsp;days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the third-party&#146;s
	ANDA until the earliest of 30&nbsp;months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third party. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit
	within the required 45-day period, the third-party&#146;s ANDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend&nbsp;intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive
	and time-consuming, may divert our management&#146;s attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely impact our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our products.

	loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2026 for federal purposes and 2027 for state purposes if we have not used them prior to that time, and our federal tax credits will begin expiring in 2025 unless previously used. To the extent we have not
	exchanged our Connecticut research tax credits for a tax refund, those tax credits carryforward indefinitely. Additionally, our ability to use any net operating loss and credit carryforwards to offset taxable income or tax, respectively, in the
	future will be limited under Internal Revenue Code Sections&nbsp;382 and 383, respectively, if we have a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% within a three-year period. The completion of our initial public offering in 2014 and our
	follow-on public offering in 2015, together with private placements and other transactions that have occurred, may trigger, or may have already triggered such an ownership change. In addition, since we will need to raise substantial additional

	net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income or tax, respectively. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the net operating loss
	carryforwards and research tax credits before they expire. In addition, certain states have suspended use of net operating loss carryforwards for certain taxable years, and other states are considering similar measures. As a result, we may incur
	higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, continued suspension of our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards in states in which we are subject to income tax could have an adverse impact on our

	On
	January&nbsp;30, 2014, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No 333-192230) was declared effective for our initial public offering, pursuant to which we registered the offering and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value
	per share (including 750,000 shares issued upon the underwriters&#146; exercise of an option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $11.00 per share for an aggregate public offering price of $63.3 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of the initial public offering, we received net proceeds on February&nbsp;5, 2014 of approximately $58.8 million from the sale of
	5,750,000 shares of common stock, after deducting approximately $4.4 million of underwriting discounts and commissions but before giving effect to any offering expenses borne by us. In addition, we have paid approximately an additional $2.5 million
	of offering expenses in connection with our IPO. None of such payments were direct or indirect payments to any of (i)&nbsp;our directors or officers or their associates, (ii)&nbsp;persons owning 10 percent or more of our common stock, or
	(iii)&nbsp;our affiliates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering from that
	described in the final prospectus related to the offering, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February&nbsp;3, 2014. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have used $24.8 million of the proceeds from our initial public offering
	for clinical trials and payments to research and development consultants.

	Introduction
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a
	clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain and pruritus by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. We are developing a novel and proprietary class of
	product candidates that target the body&#146;s peripheral nervous system.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our most advanced product candidate, I.V. CR845, demonstrated
	significant pain relief and a favorable safety and tolerability profile in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with acute postoperative pain without inducing many of the undesirable side effects
	typically associated with currently available pain therapeutics. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we successfully completed a Human Abuse Liability, or HAL, trial of I.V. CR845 in which I.V. CR845 met the primary endpoint of demonstrating
	statistically significant lower &#147;drug liking&#148; scores as compared to the approved schedule IV opioid, pentazocine. We believe that the totality of results from the HAL trial are supportive of the potential for CR845 to be the first
	non-scheduled or low scheduled (Schedule V) peripheral opioid for acute pain.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April 2015, we completed an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with
	the FDA, to discuss the design of our pivotal trials for our I.V. CR845 product candidate in acute pain. In September 2015, we initiated our Phase 3 clinical trial program for I.V. CR845 in postoperative pain with the dosing of the first subjects in
	an adaptive pivotal trial in patients undergoing a range of abdominal surgeries. This trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group adaptive design trial with repeated doses of I.V. CR845 or placebo
	administered both prior to and following abdominal surgery in male and female patients. The trial will enroll up to 600 patients undergoing either hysterectomy, prostatectomy, hemi-colectomy or ventral hernia, all of which are associated with
	moderate-to-severe postoperative visceral pain, at approximately 30 clinical sites within the United States. Three dose levels of I.V. CR845 (1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 ug/kg I.V.) will be compared to placebo, with an interim conditional power assessment to
	identify optimal doses that will be used to complete the enrollment of this study. The primary efficacy measure is the Change in Pain Intensity over the 24-hour postoperative period, or AUC-24, using the patient-reported Numeric Rating Scale, or
	NRS, score collected at pre-specified time points through 24 hours. Postoperative nausea and vomiting, or PONV, will be evaluated as a secondary efficacy measure. The impact of I.V. CR845 treatment on inflammatory biomarkers will also be explored.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2016, the FDA advised us that our adaptive pivotal trial of I.V. CR845 for postoperative pain had been placed on IND clinical
	hold pending a safety review. The clinical hold was based on a stopping rule related to elevated serum sodium levels of greater than 150 mmol/L that was included in the clinical trial protocol. Four patients out of 90 total patients dosed to date,
	all of whom were in the highest I.V. CR845 dose group (5 ug/kg), exhibited transient serum sodium levels equal to or greater than 150 mmol/L. All four patients were asymptomatic and sodium levels resolved to normal levels (less than 146 mmol/L)
	within 24 hours post-dosing with standard fluid management. No patients in the other two dose groups (2 ug/kg and 1 ug/kg) exhibited serum sodium levels greater than 150 mmol/L. A review of unblinded safety data has been undertaken by both us and
	the Independent Data Monitoring Committee in accordance with the clinical trial protocol.

	The most common adverse events (&gt; 5%) reported across treatment groups and placebo so far were
	nausea, hypernatremia, abdominal distension and procedural hypotension. All cases of abdominal distension and procedural hypotension were attributed to the surgical procedure and not to study drug. There were no cases of respiratory depression, no
	adverse events greater than Grade 1, and no CR845-associated serious adverse events have been reported. We anticipate continuing the trial following FDA review of the patient safety data and removal of the clinical hold.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on previous guidance from the FDA, we believe we will require 1,500 total exposures to I.V. CR845, including all Phase&nbsp;1, Phase 2
	and Phase 3 trials, prior to submitting a new drug application, or NDA. We believe our planned clinical trials and our clinical trials completed to date will result in a sufficient number of drug exposures to support an NDA.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also developing an oral version of CR845, or Oral CR845, for acute and chronic pain. In August 2015, we advanced our tablet formulation
	of Oral CR845 into a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with osteoarthritis, or OA of the knee or hip. The Phase 2a trial was a single-blind, randomized, multiple ascending dose trial designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and
	effectiveness of oral CR845 tablets dosed over a two-week treatment period in OA patients experiencing moderate-to-severe pain, defined as &gt;4 on an 11-point NRS at baseline. Patients discontinued current pain medications five days prior to
	baseline measurements. Four tablet strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 5.0 mg) were administered twice a day over a two-week treatment period in a total of 80 OA patients enrolled at five sites in the United States. In addition to safety and PK
	observations, CR845&#146;s effectiveness was assessed by: change from baseline in joint pain using the Numeric Rating Scale, or NRS, which was measured daily, change from baseline in the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index, or WOMAC,
	which was measured at the end of Weeks 1 and 2 of treatment, change from baseline in rescue medication use, measured daily, and Patient Global Assessment, or PGA, which was measured on the last day of the study. Acetaminophen was the only allowable
	rescue medication. PK analyses indicated dose-proportional exposure of CR845 after oral administration, with the 5.0 mg dose group exhibiting an approximately five-fold increased mean AUC value compared to the 1.0 mg dose group.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2015, we announced positive top-line results from this Phase 2a trial. The results show a dose-related reduction in mean baseline
	pain score up to 34% after two weeks, with statistically significant reduction in mean rescue medication for the top 5.0 mg dose group of approximately 80 percent (ANOVA: p= 0.02, for 5.0 mg vs lower dose groups). The effectiveness of the 5.0 mg
	dose was further supported by statistically significant, dose-related increases in the proportion of patients whose OA was &#147;very much improved&#148; or &#147;much improved&#148; as indicated by patient global assessment (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel
	test, p=0.02, 2-sided). In this trial, all four tablet strengths were observed to be safe and well tolerated. The Phase 2a trial establishes therapeutic doses and a dosing regimen for a larger double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial, which
	we plan to conduct during the second half of 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CR845 has exhibited anti-pruritic, or anti-itch, potency in standard preclinical
	models. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported positive top-line dose-ranging PK and safety data from a Phase 1b clinical trial, which was part A of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, of I.V. CR845 for the treatment of uremic pruritus, a systemic
	condition with high prevalence in dialysis patients, for which there are no approved therapeutics in the United States. In July 2015, we reported positive top-line efficacy results from Part B of this Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, in which we
	observed that I.V. CR845 demonstrated statistically significant results on the primary endpoint of reducing worst itch intensity as well as the secondary endpoint of quality of life improvements
<B>
	.
</B>
	We also observed I.V. CR845 to have a
	favorable safety and tolerability profile in the trial.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on the results of this trial, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we
	completed a guidance meeting with the FDA, the outcome of which will guide the overall design of our Phase 3 clinical trial program for I.V. CR845 for the treatment of uremic pruritus. Subject to the feedback from the FDA, we intend to initiate a
	first Phase 2/3 adaptive pivotal trial in uremic pruritus in the first half of 2016.

	Under the terms of the Maruishi Agreement, we received a non-refundable and non-creditable
	upfront license fee of $15.0 million and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $6.0 million in clinical development milestones and $4.5 million in regulatory milestones. In August 2014, we received a clinical development milestone payment of
	$0.5 million upon completion by Maruishi of a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan related to CR845 in acute post-operative pain. In October 2015, we received a $1.7 million milestone payment (net of contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments of
	$0.3 million) related to the initiation by Maruishi of a Phase 2 clinical trial of CR845 in Japan for uremic pruritus. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties, with percentages ranging from the low double digits to the low twenties, based
	on net sales of products containing CR845 in Japan, if any, and share in any sub-license fees. In addition, in connection with the Maruishi Agreement, Maruishi purchased 2,105,263 shares of our Junior A Preferred Stock for $3.80 per share, for an

	CKD in consideration for $0.4&nbsp;million, which shares were automatically converted into 69,444 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering. During 2012, we received $0.6 million, net of foreign taxes, from CKD upon the

	I.V. CR845 in uremic pruritus and Oral CR845 in OA. However, it is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, or if, when or to

	For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, the net increase
	in direct preclinical studies and clinical trial costs and related consultant costs primarily resulted from increases totaling $5.4 million for the I.V. CR845 Phase 2/3 adaptive study and the Phase 2a Oral CR845 study in patients with OA and a net
	increase of $1.4 million of CR845 drug manufacturing costs. Those costs were partially offset by decreases totaling $4.0 million in clinical trial costs in connection with the I.V. CR845 HAL trial and the Oral CR845 Phase 1a/1b trials. There was
	also a net increase of $0.6 million of preclinical costs. The increase in stock-based compensation expense mostly reflects additional grants to more employees. The increase in other R&amp;D operating expenses was primarily the result of an increase
	in payroll and related costs associated with R&amp;D personnel, recruiting costs and the cost of meetings and travel.

	For the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the net increase in direct preclinical studies and clinical trial costs and related consultant costs primarily resulted from increases totaling $5.2 million for the Phase 1
	Oral CR845 trial, the Phase 2 I.V. CR845 uremic pruritus trial and the I.V. CR845 HAL trial and a net increase of $2.6 million of CR845 drug manufacturing costs. Those increases in costs were partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in
	clinical trial costs in connection with the Phase 2 I.V. CR845 bunionectomy trial and the Phase 1 I.V. CR845 renal impairment trial. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects the granting of stock options in 2014, whereas there were
	no such grants in 2013. The increase in other R&amp;D operating expenses was primarily the result of increases in payroll and related costs associated with R&amp;D personnel and the cost of clinical compound sold to Maruishi as Maruishi increased
	its clinical trial activity in Japan.

	For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, the increase in
	professional fees and public/investor relations costs primarily included increases in public/investor relations costs, in legal fees and in accounting and auditing fees. Those increases were partially offset by decreases in consultant fees and
	patent costs. The increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects additional grants to more employees and members of our Board of Directors than in the same period in 2014. The increase in other G&amp;A operating expenses included
	increases in payroll and related costs, in connection with increased headcount, and in insurance costs.

	For the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the increase in professional fees and public/investor relations costs included increases in directors&#146; fees as a result of our becoming a public company. Those increases
	were partially offset by decreases in consultant costs, primarily related to the success fee we incurred in connection with entering into the Maruishi Agreement in 2013, and decreased accounting and auditing fees, which were higher in 2013 in
	preparation for our initial public offering. Stock-based compensation expense increased due to the granting of stock options in 2014 in connection with the IPO. The increase in other G&amp;A operating expenses included increases in payroll and
	related costs and directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance costs, both as a result of our becoming a public company.

	December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had $106.7 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities, which we expect will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements

	In order to fund future operations, including our planned clinical trials, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File

	debt securities, warrants or any combination thereof. On August&nbsp;4, 2015, we completed a follow-on public offering of 4,327,956 shares of our common stock, including 564,516 shares sold pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their
	option to buy additional shares, pursuant to this shelf registration statement and a related prospectus supplement dated July&nbsp;29, 2015, filed with the SEC on July&nbsp;30, 2015. We received gross proceeds from the offering of approximately
	$80.5 million, or net proceeds of $75.2 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us. We may offer additional securities under this shelf registration statement from time to time in response to

	Based on timing

	pain; and (3) advancing our CR845 uremic pruritus program through a Phase 2/3 adaptive pivotal trial, we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities as of December 31, 2015 will be sufficient for
	us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the end of the first quarter of 2018, without giving effect to any potential milestone payments we may receive under our collaboration agreements with Maruishi and CKD.
	Because the process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain, it is possible that the assumptions upon which we have based this estimate may prove to be wrong, and we could
	use our capital resources sooner than we presently expect.

	Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which
	have been prepared in accordance with Generally-Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical
	experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We
	periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.

	We have
	entered into license agreements to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple elements, including licenses and research and development services. Payments to us under these
	agreements may include non-refundable upfront license fees, payments for research activities, payments based upon the achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales. There are
	no performance, cancellation, termination or refund provisions in any of the arrangements that contain material financial consequences to us.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

<I>

</I>
	. In order to account for these agreements, we identify the deliverables included within an arrangement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on whether certain
	criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the counterparty. The consideration received is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on each unit&#146;s relative selling price. The
	identification of individual elements in a multiple-element arrangement and the estimation of the selling price of each element involves significant judgment, including consideration as to whether each delivered element has standalone value.

	We determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling
	price, if available, or third party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or our best estimate of selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires
	significant judgment. Because we do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we typically uses our best estimate of a selling price to estimate the selling prices for
	licenses to our proprietary technology. In making these estimates, we consider market conditions and entity-specific factors, including those contemplated in

	needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our best estimate of selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine our best estimate of selling price will have a significant
	effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between deliverables. We recognize consideration allocated to an individual element when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element.

	Arrangement consideration allocated to license deliverables that represent separate units of accounting are recognized as revenue at the

	In connection with arrangement consideration allocated to research and development
	services, our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress and results of our research and development activities. Due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop
	a drug product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and
	could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. In addition, our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays or we decide to expand or contract our clinical plans
	for a drug candidate.

	Our license agreements include contingent milestone payments related to specified clinical development milestones
	and regulatory milestones. Development milestones are payable when a product candidate initiates or advances into different clinical trial phases. Regulatory milestones are payable upon submission for marketing approval with the FDA or other
	countries&#146; regulatory authorities or on receipt of actual marketing approvals for the compound or for additional indications. At the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each such payment is a
	milestone payment as defined by ASC 605-28,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition&nbsp;&#150; Milestone Method
</I>
	, because achievement requires performance by us and, at inception of the arrangement, there is substantive uncertainty that the event will be

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the payment
	meets the criteria of a milestone payment, we evaluate whether such milestone is considered to be substantive. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the entity&#146;s
	performance to achieve the milestone, or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the consideration relates
	solely to past performance and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be
	overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We recognize substantive milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria
	are met. If any milestone payment is considered not to be a substantive milestone or if considered to be a contingent payment, we initially defer the milestone payment, allocate it to the deliverables based on relative selling price in the same
	proportion as at inception of the agreement, immediately recognize revenue to the extent of any delivered elements and recognize the portion attributable to any undelivered elements over the remaining term of our performance obligations. If no such
	performance obligations exist, milestones that are considered not to be substantive or are considered to be contingent payments are generally recognized as revenue upon achievement, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

	Expected volatility is

	The expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently
	anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. Risk-free interest rates are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options&#146; expected lives. A higher volatility input to the Black-Scholes option

	Stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the time of grant of each award, of the number of awards that are
	expected to be forfeited. This estimate is based upon historical experience of the occurrence of forfeitures of prior awards that we have granted. We revise this estimate, if necessary, in subsequent periods as each award vests, if actual
	forfeitures differ from those estimates. To the extent that the actual forfeiture rate for an award is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, additional compensation expense is recorded in the period that the award vests.

	re-measurement of each award, income or expense is recognized during its vesting term. For all share-based payments granted to employees and non-employees, compensation cost relating to awards with service-based graded vesting schedules is

	value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market
	participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risks.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We invest a majority
	of our cash reserves in a variety of available-for-sale marketable securities, including money market funds and investment-grade debt instruments, principally corporate notes, commercial paper and direct obligations of the U.S. government and
	government-sponsored entities, and in cash equivalents. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have invested $91.6 million of our cash reserves in such marketable securities. Those marketable securities include $49.7 million of investment grade debt
	instruments with an average interest rate of approximately 0.53% and maturities through September 2016 and $41.9 million of money market funds with an average interest rate of 0.26%. As of December 31, 2014, we had $52.7 million of interest-bearing
	money market accounts, classified as cash equivalents. We maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy, which includes guidelines on acceptable investment securities, minimum credit quality, maturity parameters, and
	concentration and diversification. The primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity and to meet operating needs. Our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if
	market interest rates increase. However, due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration, interest rate risk is mitigated and we do not believe a change in interest rates would have a material impact on our financial
	statements. We do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although our investments are subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits
	the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment. Nonetheless, deterioration of the credit quality of an investment security subsequent to purchase may subject us to the risk of not being able to recover the full
	principal value of the security.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Management of Cara Therapeutics, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
	defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
	of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Management utilized the criteria established in the Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of
	Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Based on the assessment, management has concluded that, as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

	This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an

	rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management&#146;s report in this annual report for so long as we remain an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.

	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Cara Therapeutics, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of
	comprehensive loss, convertible preferred stock and stockholders&#146; (deficit) equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s
	management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the
	standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were
	not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
	evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
	audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
	the financial position of Cara Therapeutics, Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally

	Cara Therapeutics, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical corporation formed on July&nbsp;2,
	2004. The Company is focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain and pruritus by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. The Company&#146;s primary activities to date have been organizing and
	staffing the Company, developing its product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of CR845-based product candidates and raising capital.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $204,800 from several rounds of equity financing,
	including its initial public offering, or IPO, which closed in February 2014 and its follow-on offering, which closed in August 2015 (see Note 12,
<I>
	Stockholders&#146; Equity
</I>
	), and the issuance of debt. In addition, the Company earned
	approximately $32,500 under its license agreements for CR845, primarily with Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (&#147;Maruishi&#148;) and Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corp. (&#147;CKD&#148;), and for an earlier product candidate for which
	development efforts ceased in 2007.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the license of rights to CR845 in Japan to Maruishi and as part of the earnings
	described above, in April 2013, the Company received an upfront payment of $15,000, and in August 2014 and September 2015, the Company received an additional $480 and $1,725 (net of contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments), respectively,
	in milestone payments. In connection with the license of rights to CR845 in South Korea to CKD and as part of the earnings described above, in 2012, the Company received aggregate upfront and milestone payments of $1,190, and in August 2015 and
	October 2015, the Company received an additional $209 and $417 (net of South Korean withholding taxes), respectively, in milestone payments.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $106,740 and an accumulated
	deficit of $104,891. The Company has incurred substantial net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities in nearly every fiscal period since inception and expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. The Company
	recognized a net loss of $24,690 and had net cash used in operating activities of $21,478 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The Company expects that cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at December&nbsp;31, 2015 will be
	sufficient to fund its operations beyond one year.

	The Company is subject to risks common to other life science companies including, but
	not limited to, uncertainty of product development and commercialization, lack of marketing and sales history, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, market acceptance of products, product
	liability, protection of proprietary technology, ability to raise additional financing, and compliance with Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) and other government regulations. If the Company does not successfully commercialize any of
	its product candidates, it will be unable to generate recurring product revenue or achieve profitability.

	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally-accepted accounting principles in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;)
	requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of
	revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from the Company&#146;s estimates and assumptions. Significant estimates include the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as level 2 of the
	fair value hierarchy, useful lives of fixed assets, the periods over which certain revenues will be recognized, including licensing and collaborative revenue recognized from non-refundable up-front and milestone payments, the determination of
	prepaid research and development clinical costs and accrued research projects, the amount of non-cash compensation costs related to share-based payments to employees and non-employees and the periods over which those costs are expensed and the
	likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets.

	Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents

	liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements, maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions. The Company&#146;s investment policy includes guidelines
	on acceptable investment securities, limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by the U.S. government and institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on
	maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. The Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held by a few major financial institutions. In accordance with the Company&#146;s policies, the Company monitors exposure
	with its counterparties. The Company also maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes that the Company is
	not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held.

	The Company deems certain of its investments to be marketable securities if the investment, or in the case of money market funds, the
	securities underlying the money market fund, meet the definition of a debt security in Accounting Standards Codification section 320-10-20. The Company considers its marketable securities to be available-for-sale and, accordingly, these investments
	are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses generally recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (&#147;AOCI&#148;) as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. Marketable securities are reported in Marketable
	Securities in the Balance Sheets. Other income (expense), net, includes interest, realized gains and losses on sales of securities and other-than-temporary impairment (&#147;OTTI&#148;) declines in the fair value of securities, if any. The cost of
	securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company reviews its available-for-sale marketable securities for OTTI
	declines in fair value below its cost basis each quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the cost basis of an asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time
	and the extent to which the fair value has been below its cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the security, including any changes to the credit rating of the security, and the intent to sell, or whether the Company will more
	likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company&#146;s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in
	assumptions related to any particular security.

	If a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale marketable debt security in the
	Company&#146;s investment portfolio is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the security to its current fair value. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be forced to
	sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost of the security, the loss is recognized in net income. Otherwise, the loss is separated into a portion representing a credit loss, which is recorded in net income, and the remainder is recorded
	in Other Comprehensive Income (&#147;OCI&#148;), net of taxes. See Note 3, M

	The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
	financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When
	determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the market-based risk measurements or
	assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risks.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale marketable securities, restricted cash,
	accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
	Marketable securities are reported on the Company&#146;s Balance Sheets at their fair values, based upon pricing of securities with the same or similar investment characteristics as provided by pricing services, as described below.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Current accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards
	Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) section 820, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. The valuation techniques included in the guidance are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily
	obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company&#146;s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information
	available in the circumstances.

	The Company records revenue related to these agreements in accordance with ASC 605-25,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements
</I>
	. In order to account for these agreements, the Company identifies the deliverables included within an arrangement and evaluates which deliverables represent separate units of accounting based
	on whether certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the counterparty. The consideration received is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on each unit&#146;s relative selling
	price. The identification of individual elements in a multiple-element arrangement and the estimation of the selling price of each element involves significant judgment, including evaluation as to whether each delivered element has standalone value.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company determines the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor specific objective evidence
	(&#147;VSOE&#148;) of selling price, if available, or third party evidence (&#147;TPE&#148;) of selling price if VSOE is not available, or the Company&#146;s best estimate of selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best
	estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. Because the Company does not have VSOE or third party evidence of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to its proprietary technology, it
	typically uses its best estimate of a selling price to estimate the selling prices for licenses to its proprietary technology. In making these estimates, the Company considers market conditions and entity-specific factors, including those
	contemplated in negotiating the agreements, as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product
	candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its best estimate of selling price, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation
	of arrangement consideration between deliverables. The Company recognizes consideration allocated to an individual element when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element.

	that its license deliverables represent separate units of accounting because the counterparty has the right to sublicense and manufacture in its territory, as defined.

	The Company&#146;s license agreements include contingent milestone

	submission for marketing approval with the FDA or other countries&#146; regulatory authorities or on receipt of actual marketing approvals for the compound or for additional indications. At the inception of each agreement that includes milestone
	payments, the Company evaluates whether each such payment is a milestone payment as defined by ASC 605-28,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition&nbsp;&#150; Milestone Method
</I>
	, because achievement requires performance by the Company and, at inception of the
	arrangement, there is substantive uncertainty that the event will be achieved, or whether the payment is a contingent payment, because achievement requires performance by the counterparty.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the payment meets the criteria of a milestone payment, the Company evaluates whether such milestone is considered to be substantive. This
	evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a
	specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms
	within the arrangement. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective
	milestone in making this assessment.

	the Company takes possession of the property. Rent expense includes the base amounts stated in the lease agreement as well as the effect of reduced or free rent and rent escalations. At lease inception, the Company determines the lease term by
	assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured because of the significant economic penalty that exists for not exercising those options. The exercise of renewal options is at the Company&#146;s sole discretion. The
	expected lease term is one of the factors used to determine whether a lease is classified operating or capital and is used to calculate the straight-line rent expense. The difference between the cash paid to the landlord and the amount recognized as
	rent expense on a straight-line basis is included in deferred rent and classified within long-term liabilities. Cash reimbursements received from landlords for leasehold improvements and other cash payments received from landlords as lease
	incentives are recorded as deferred rent and classified as long-term liabilities. Deferred rent related to landlord incentives is amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term as an offset to rent expense. Penalties paid to landlords
	to terminate a lease before the contractual end date of the lease are recognized on an undiscounted basis in the Statements of Comprehensive Loss.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company held a total of 15 positions that were in an unrealized loss
	position, none of which had been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater. Based on the Company&#146;s review of these securities, the Company believes that the cost basis of its available-for-sale marketable securities is recoverable
	and that, therefore, it had no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The Company does not intend to sell these debt securities and the Company believes it is not more likely than not that it will be
	required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.

	marketable securities, the Company&#146;s only component of AOCI, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, all of the Company&#146;s funds were held in money
	market savings and checking accounts that were classified as cash equivalents and not as available-for-sale marketable securities. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, there were no reclassifications from AOCI since there were no sales of

	9. Convertible Promissory Notes
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December&nbsp;2012 and February&nbsp;2013, the Company issued an aggregate of $4,000 principal amount of Convertible
	Promissory Notes (&#147;Notes&#148;) due August&nbsp;28, 2013 (&#147;Maturity Date&#148;). The sale was consummated through two closings. The initial closing was on December&nbsp;28, 2012 for $2,538 principal amount. The final closing was on
	February&nbsp;28, 2013 for $1,462 principal amount. All of the Notes were purchased by current stockholders, all of whom were given the opportunity to buy their pro rata share of the Notes. The holders of preferred stock who did not participate in
	the Note financing had their shares of preferred stock converted into common stock at their respective then applicable conversion rates. As a result, as of February 2013, 2,246,743 shares of preferred stock were converted into 959,545 shares of
	common stock.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because the original terms of the preferred stock were modified to reflect this mandatory conversion, the Company
	determined that the preferred stock had been extinguished. Accordingly, the conversion date difference between the carrying value of the preferred stock converted ($4,466) and the fair value of the common stock issued ($3,575) has been recorded as a
	gain ($891) within accumulated deficit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Notes bore interest at 8%&nbsp;per annum and had a Maturity Date of August&nbsp;28, 2013. The
	Notes were not eligible to be repaid prior to the maturity date without the consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes included an optional conversion feature and a
	mandatory conversion feature.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The optional conversion feature allowed the Note holder, any time prior to the Maturity Date, to elect to
	convert the balance of the note plus accrued interest into Series D convertible preferred stock at a conversion price of $1.444244 per share. In accordance with ASC 470-20,
<I>
	Debt with Conversion and Other Options
</I>
	, the Company determined that
	the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature embedded in the Notes issued in the initial closing was $2,050, based on the estimated fair value of the Series D convertible preferred stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 of $2.61 per share,
	and this intrinsic value was recorded as a debt discount, to be accreted to interest expense over the term of the Notes. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, the Company amortized $25 of debt discount to interest expense. As of February&nbsp;28, 2013, the
	final closing of the Note financing, the Company determined that the intrinsic

	value of the beneficial conversion feature of the Notes issued in the final closing was $1,382 and recorded this amount as an additional debt discount. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013,
	the Company amortized $3,407 of debt discount to interest expense.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The mandatory conversion of the Notes would have occurred in the event
	the Company issued or sold equity securities on or before August&nbsp;28, 2013 of not less than $10,000. In this event, the Notes plus all accrued interest would have automatically converted into the issued class of equity securities at a price per
	share equal to 90% of the cash price paid by the investors in the new equity securities. In accordance with ASC 815-15,
<I>
	Derivatives and Hedging
</I>
	, the Company was required to record the embedded mandatory conversion feature as a free-standing
	financial instrument, as the conversion feature was a substantial contingent call option. The Company recorded $41 as the fair value of the contingent call option liability related to the Notes issued in the initial closing of the Note financing as
	of December&nbsp;31, 2012, with a corresponding amount recorded as additional debt discount, with the debt discount to be accreted to interest expense over the life of the Notes. Any increases or decreases to the fair value of the contingent call
	option would be recorded in operations through the life of the Notes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent call option
	by estimating the accreted value of the Notes upon conversion, with consideration provided for the 10% price discount and the probability of the Company closing an equity offering in excess of $10,000 before August&nbsp;28, 2013. The Company
	classified the liability within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the probability factor is an unobservable input and significant to the valuation model. Increases in the probability of an equity offering closing before August&nbsp;28, 2013 in
	excess of $10,000 would increase the fair value of the liability. In April 2013, the estimated fair value of the contingent call option of $41 was reduced to zero with an equal reduction in interest expense, since the Company estimated the
	probability of closing a $10,000 equity offering before August&nbsp;28, 2013 as zero, following the receipt of $23,000 in connection with the Maruishi transaction in April 2013, which removed the need for a $10,000 financing prior to August&nbsp;28,
	2013.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Prior to the Maturity Date, the Company received notice from Note holders to convert Notes in the aggregate amount of $3,888 in
	principal plus accrued interest, into 2,692,291 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock, and the remaining Notes, in the aggregate amount of $311 in principal and accrued interest, were repaid during October 2013.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Deferred financing costs related to the convertible promissory notes were amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective
	interest method. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, deferred financing cost of $117 was amortized and included in interest expense, within other income (expense), net.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In September&nbsp;2007, the Company entered into a $4,000 term loan (&#147;Loan&#148;) with Connecticut Innovations Inc.
	(&#147;CII&#148;). The Loan carried a 7% interest rate and was payable in monthly installments over five years. The Loan was collateralized by property and equipment which was owned by the Company that was located in Shelton, Connecticut. The CII
	Loan contained certain non-financial covenants, including the requirement that the Company maintain its principal place of business and conduct the majority of its operations in Connecticut. If the Company failed to maintain its Connecticut
	presence, all amounts due under the Loan would be immediately due and payable with the cumulative interest rate increasing to 25%.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On
	September&nbsp;4, 2012, the Company and CII amended the Loan to defer all payments due between July&nbsp;1, 2012 and December&nbsp;31, 2012 until January&nbsp;2, 2013 and to increase the interest rate to 8.5%. The Company repaid the remaining
	principal balance of $307 plus accrued interest outstanding under the Loan in April&nbsp;2013.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the Loan, the Company
	issued to CII a warrant to purchase 19,851 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.08. The fair value of such warrant at the date of issuance was determined not to be material. The warrant also incorporated the non-financial covenants of
	the Loan described above. If the Company failed to maintain its Connecticut presence, it would be required to pay CII the excess of the market price of the common stock over the warrant exercise price for all unexercised shares represented by the
	warrant and/or the exercise price paid plus the market price on any shares acquired through a previous exercise of the warrants. On July&nbsp;31, 2014, CII exercised its outstanding warrant in a cashless exercise, resulting in the issuance of 6,383
	shares of the Company&#146;s common stock.

	In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, including a deemed liquidation event, as
	defined in the Company&#146;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the following liquidation preferences as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 were payable to the holders of Preferred Stock: Series D Preferred Stock, aggregate liquidation

	a maximum of an additional $4.332732 per share for the holders of Series D Preferred Stock. As a result, the Series D Preferred Stock&#146;s total liquidation preference could have been up to $70,000, exclusive of any declared, but unpaid dividends.

	In April, 2012, the Company entered into a license agreement with CKD (the &#147;CKD Agreement&#148;) that provides CKD with the exclusive
	rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing CR845 in South Korea. Under the CKD Agreement, the Company received a non-refundable and non-creditable amount of $1,000 and is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling
	$3,750, relating to pre-defined clinical development ($2,250) and regulatory events ($1,500), as well as royalties on sales of any marketed products containing CR845. The Company has accounted for the milestones under ASC 605
<I>
	Revenue Recognition
	&#150; Milestone Method
</I>
	. At the time of execution of the CKD Agreement, there was significant uncertainty as to whether the stated milestones would be achieved. In conjunction with this uncertainty, the Company has determined that the milestones
	are substantive in nature as they are commensurate with the enhancement of value of the delivered license because they relate to clinical success and advancement within the FDA drug development platform. The milestones also relate solely to past
	performance and monetary investment of the Company to achieve the clinical advancement.

	estimated fair value as of the transaction date. The remaining proceeds of $646 were recorded as license revenue as the license was the only deliverable within the agreement that had stand-alone value and was determined to be a separate unit of

	In September 2015, the Company met the milestone criteria, as set forth in the CKD Agreement, for completion of a Phase 2 trial of CR845 in uremic pruritus patients in the United States. As a result, in October 2015, the Company received a milestone
	payment of $417 (net of South Korean withholding tax of $83) from CKD. Both milestones were considered to be substantive and the full amount of the milestone payments was recognized as milestone revenue when the milestones were achieved.

	In April 2013, the Company entered into a license agreement with Maruishi (the &#147;Maruishi Agreement&#148;) under which the Company granted
	Maruishi an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize drug products containing CR845 for acute pain and uremic pruritus in Japan. Under the Maruishi Agreement, the Company and Maruishi are required to use commercially reasonable
	efforts, at their own expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize CR845 in the United States and Japan, respectively. In addition, the Company provided Maruishi specific clinical development services for CR845 used in
	Maruishi&#146;s field of use.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received an upfront non-refundable, non-creditable license
	fee of $15,000. As indicated in Note 2,

</I>
	, the Company accounts for arrangements of this type under ASC 605-25,

</I>
	The Company has identified two deliverables under this guidance: (1)&nbsp;the license; and (2)&nbsp;the R&amp;D services specific to the uremic pruritus field of use. The Company has determined that the license has standalone value because Maruishi
	has the right to sublicense and manufacture CR845 in Japan. The second deliverable is the R&amp;D services, which also have standalone value as similar services are sold separately by other vendors. Since both license and R&amp;D services
	separability criteria have been met, they are being accounted for as separate units of accounting at the outset of the arrangement.

	As a result, the total value of the arrangement of $15,337 (consisting of the $15,000 upfront
	payment, plus the additional amount assigned to these deliverables as a result of the Junior A Preferred Stock premium, see below) was allocated between the two units of accounting. The Company used its best estimate of the selling price of these
	units of accounting, since, as described in Note 2
<I>
	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#150; Revenue Recognition
</I>
	, neither VSOE nor TPE was available. To determine these estimates, the Company used a discounted cash flow method that
	forecasted and analyzed CR845 in the Japanese market, the phase of clinical development as well as considering recent similar license arrangements within the same phase of clinical development, therapeutic area, type of agreement, etc. As a result,
	at inception of this license agreement, the management of the Company determined that the license and the R&amp;D services had estimated selling prices of $10,200 and $6,200, respectively. The resulting percentage allocations were applied to the
	$15,337 of total consideration, which resulted in $9,637 being assigned to the license unit of accounting, which was recognized immediately as license revenue, while $5,700 was assigned to the R&amp;D services unit of accounting. The amount assigned
	to the R&amp;D services unit of accounting was initially recorded as deferred revenue and was recognized as collaborative revenue as the services were provided through July 2015. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $0 and $1,452,
	respectively, of deferred revenue pursuant to the R&amp;D services deliverable under the Maruishi Agreement.

	Under the terms of the

	Maruishi Agreement, there was significant uncertainty as to whether the stated milestones would be achieved. In conjunction with this uncertainty, the Company has determined that the milestones achieved in the United States are substantive in nature
	as they are commensurate with the enhancement of value of the delivered license as they relate to clinical success and advancement within the FDA drug development platform. The Company accounts for those milestone payments under ASC 605-28

	achievement of one of the milestones specified in the license agreement and was considered not to be substantive. Accordingly, the Company allocated the non-refundable payment of $480, net of a contractual foreign currency exchange adjustment, to
	the two deliverables in the same proportion as the initial upfront payment had been allocated. The portion of the payment allocated to the previously delivered license deliverable ($302) was recognized as license revenue entirely at the time of
	achievement of the milestone. A portion of the payment allocated to the R&amp;D services deliverable ($88) was recognized as collaborative revenue at the time of achievement of the milestone to the extent of R&amp;D services provided through that
	date&nbsp;and the remainder ($90) was deferred and was recognized as collaborative revenue through July 2015, which was the period during which the Company provided R&amp;D services to Maruishi.

	In September 2015, Maruishi initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of CR845 in Japan for uremic pruritus, which triggered a $1,725 milestone
	payment (net of contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments of $275) to the Company. At the time of achievement of the milestone, the Company had delivered all deliverables under the Maruishi Agreement. Since the milestone was achieved in
	Japan, it was deemed not to be substantive. Accordingly, the Company recognized $1,084 as milestone revenue and $641 as collaborative revenue in connection with achievement of this milestone.

	The next potential milestone that the Company could be entitled to receive under the Maruishi Agreement will be a clinical development
	milestone for the completion of the first Phase 3 pivotal trial of CR845 in acute pain in the United States. If achieved, this milestone will result in a payment of $1,000, before contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments, being due to the

	Once the Company had title to the CR845 and had delivered it to Maruishi, prepaid expense related to that CR845 was reduced with an offset to

	years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized clinical compound revenue of $0, $674 and $102, respectively. Deposits received from Maruishi prior to delivery of CR845 were recorded as deferred revenue.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Effective April&nbsp;2005, the Company entered into a semi-exclusive worldwide royalty-free license agreement (the
	&#147;Glasgow License Agreement&#148;) for a certain G protein-coupled receptor (&#147;GPCR&#148;) assay technology with the University of Glasgow (&#147;Glasgow&#148;). The Company issued 200,000 shares of its common stock to Glasgow as
	compensation for this license.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon an exit event, including an IPO or as otherwise defined in the Glasgow License Agreement, Glasgow had
	the option to require the Company to guarantee a return of $1,000 on its 200,000 shares of common stock. If the proceeds from the exit event resulted in a return of less than $1,000, the Company was required to make an additional license payment by
	giving Glasgow cash or through the issuance of additional shares (at the Company&#146;s option), as specified in the Glasgow License Agreement. In accordance with ASC 480,
<I>
	Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
</I>
	, the Company initially recorded
	the fair value of this option as both a long-term liability and research and development expense. The Company estimated the fair value of the option using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with consideration given to the probability of an
	exit event occurring below the guaranteed amount. The fair value of the liability was estimated at each subsequent balance sheet date, with any increases or decreases to the fair value recorded as increases or decreases to research and development
	expense and the related liability. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the estimated fair value of the liability was reduced to zero based on the Company&#146;s estimated fair value of common stock after the Maruishi transaction (see Note 11,
<I>
	Collaborations
</I>
	). The Company classified the liability within Level 3 as the probability factor is an unobservable input and significant to the valuation model. The Company used a probability factor of 10% in all periods from 2005 to 2013. The
	probability rate was based on the successful progress of the Company&#146;s product candidates containing CR845 and the Company&#146;s expectation of an exit event value below the guaranteed amount. An increase in the probability rate would have
	resulted in a higher liability while an increase in the stock price would have reduced the liability. The decrease in the value of the liability of $35 in 2013 was the result of changes in the observable inputs (i.e. stock value, interest rates and
	volatility) and was recorded in research and development expense. The closing of the Company&#146;s IPO on February&nbsp;5, 2014 constituted an exit event under the Glasgow License Agreement. Since the public offering price in the IPO was $11.00 per
	share, the aggregate exit event value was greater than the guaranteed amount. Consequently, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company no longer had a liability under the Glasgow License Agreement.
