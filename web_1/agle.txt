	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:4PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	We are a biotechnology company committed to
	developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism that we believe will transform the lives of patients with inborn errors of metabolism and cancer. Our engineered human enzymes are designed to degrade specific amino acids in
	the blood. In inborn errors of metabolism, or IEM, a subset of rare genetic metabolic diseases, we are seeking to reduce toxic levels of amino acids in patients. In oncology, we are seeking to reduce amino acid blood levels below the normal range,
	where we believe we will be able to exploit the dependence of certain cancers on specific amino acids.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Our lead product candidate, AEB1102, is
	engineered to degrade the amino acid arginine and is being developed to treat two extremes of arginine metabolism, including arginine excess in patients with Arginase I deficiency, an IEM, as well as some cancers which have been shown to have a
	metabolic dependence on arginine. Arginine is an amino acid involved in many biochemical functions in the body. AEB1102 has demonstrated the ability to reduce blood arginine levels in clinical and nonclinical studies, supporting its potential use as
	a treatment of both Arginase I deficiency and cancer. We have an effective investigational new drug application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for AEB1102 for the treatment of solid tumors. In October 2015, we initiated
	enrollment for this dose escalation trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. We have since treated our first two cohorts of seven patients total, and a temporary reduction of blood arginine was observed, providing initial human proof of
	mechanism for AEB1102. We have an effective IND and plan to initiate a Phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with hematological malignancies in the first half of 2016. We plan to initiate expansion trials in patients with solid tumors and an
	additional Phase 1 trial in combination with the standard of care in one or more solid tumor types in 2017. We have an effective IND for a Phase 1 dose escalation study in adult Arginase&nbsp;I deficiency patients and anticipate starting enrollment
	in the first half of 2016. We anticipate submitting a clinical trial application, or CTA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the second half of 2016 for a Phase 2 trial in Arginase I deficiency patients and expect to initiate that trial in
	the first half of 2017. We are also building a pipeline of additional product candidates targeting key amino acids formed in or necessary for metabolism, or metabolites. These targets include the amino acid homocystine, a target for another IEM, as
	well as the amino acids cysteine/cystine and the amino acid methionine in oncology. Our current product candidates have been in-licensed from the University of Texas at Austin or assigned to us from one of our founders. We retain global
	commercialization rights for all of our product candidates.

	Enzymatic
	defects in metabolic processes contribute to a class of genetic diseases known as IEM. We focus on those IEM that are characterized by excess levels of amino acids and other metabolites that become toxic to patients. In these circumstances, we
	expect patients to benefit from reduced levels of the target amino acid or metabolite to a normal concentration range. We believe this can be successfully achieved through our enzyme replacement therapy.

	Enzyme-based therapies that degrade amino acids
	have shown clinical benefit in the treatment of cancer. However, some microbial-derived enzymes, derived from microorganisms like bacteria, may have limited clinical utility due to the patients&#146; immunological reaction to these agents. We expect
	that our enzyme product candidates, which are engineered from human proteins, will be less likely to elicit an immune response, a defense function of the body to protect against invading pathogens or foreign tissues, as compared to microbial enzymes
	and should provide greater flexibility with respect to the target amino acids that can be addressed to treat disease.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:4PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	We apply our cellular metabolism
	expertise to build a portfolio of engineered human enzyme therapeutics that target distinct metabolites and provide additional therapeutic options for IEM and cancer. We identify new targets for enzyme therapeutics by leveraging scientific and
	medical literature and available clinical precedents. We use protein engineering techniques to create enzymes displaying the requisite catalytic and pharmacological properties that can degrade these targets and effectively address the metabolic
	defects observed in IEM or the dependence of certain cancers on amino acids or other metabolites. Certain metabolites require modified enzymes to properly control their levels in a therapeutic setting. We engineer human proteins as scaffolds to
	develop therapeutic products and to help avoid the immunogenicity problems, or the likelihood to cause an immune response, seen with non-human protein-based drugs. Our goal is to create engineered human enzymes with the appropriate properties to be
	developed into effective and well-tolerated therapeutics.

	Arginase I deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the Arginase I gene, ARG1, which leads to the inability to degrade arginine.
	Patients with this disease are predisposed to neurologic symptoms, including cognitive deficits and seizures, and frequently suffer from spasticity, loss of ambulation and severe intellectual disability. There is no approved therapeutic agent that

	We are planning to target the dependence of some cancers on the amino acid arginine using AEB1102. Arginine is considered a semi-essential amino acid

	Many types of cancers lose the ability to synthesize intracellular arginine, principally due to deficiency in the expression of any one or more of the
	following enzymes&#151;ornithine transcarbamoylase, or OTC, argininosuccinate synthase, or ASS, and argininosuccinate lyase, or ASL. As a result, these cancers depend on extracellular arginine uptake. When deprived of this tumor-essential nutrient,
	cancer cells die, establishing a correlation between their inability to synthesize arginine and vulnerability to arginine deprivation. As documented in scientific and medical literature and from our own nonclinical research, the lack of expression
	of any one or more of the enzymes OTC, ASS or ASL in tumor cells has been shown to be a predictive biomarker for arginine dependent cancer cells.

	cannot guarantee that any product candidate, including AEB1102, will behave similarly in all tumor types, and we will be required to obtain separate regulatory approvals for each tumor type we intend a product candidate to treat. If any of our

	In developing a product candidate, we expect that if we use a biomarker-based test to identify and only enroll
	patients in clinical trials with tumors that express the biomarker, the FDA will require the development and regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic assay as a condition to approval of the product candidate. We do not have experience or
	capabilities in developing or commercializing these companion diagnostics and plan to rely in large part on third parties to perform these functions. Companion diagnostic assays are subject to regulation by the FDA as medical devices and require
	separate regulatory approval prior to the use of such diagnostic assays with a therapeutic product candidate. If we, or any third parties that we engage to assist us, are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostic assays for use with our
	product candidates, or experience delays in development, we may be unable to identify patients with the specific profile targeted by our product candidates for enrollment in our clinical trials. Accordingly, further investment may be required to
	further develop or obtain the required regulatory approval for the relevant companion diagnostic assay, which would delay or substantially impact our ability to conduct further clinical trials or obtain regulatory approval. In addition, if a
	companion diagnostic is necessary for any of our product candidates, the delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic would delay or prevent the approval of the therapeutic product candidate. EMA, MHRA or comparable
	foreign regulatory authorities may also require the development and regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic assay as a condition to approval of the product candidate.

	We have only recently initiated a clinical trial of our lead product candidate AEB1102 in patients with solid tumors, and the risk of failure for all of
	our product candidates is high. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete nonclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and
	efficacy of our product candidates in humans for the respective target indications. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at
	any time during the clinical trial process, and we have yet to commence any clinical trial for any of our product candidates, other than AEB1102 in oncology. Further, the results of nonclinical studies and future early clinical trials of our product
	candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials that will likely differ in design and size from early-stage clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. For
	example, for AEB1102 for oncology, we have only recently treated our first two cohorts of seven patients total, and while we have observed a temporary reduction in blood arginine, this data may not necessarily be predictive of the final results of
	all patients intended to be enrolled in this Phase 1 trial or in future trials. Moreover, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates
	performed satisfactorily in nonclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans
	or will receive regulatory approval.

	We have only very recently initiated enrollment for our clinical trial for AEB1102
	for the treatment of solid tumors and treated our first two cohorts of seven patients total. Given the nature of the patient population enrolled in this trial, we expect to and have observed serious adverse events in some of these patients,
	including death. Six serious adverse events were reported in a total of four patients. These included hypercalcemia, bacteremia, pericardial effusion, respiratory failure and worsening of the patients&#146; underlying cancer, none of which were
	assessed as trial therapy-related. All patients recovered except for one who died after discontinuing the trial due to worsening of the underlying cancer. To date, we do not consider any of these serious adverse events to be drug-related and are
	proceeding with the dosing schedule. We have not dosed any of our other product candidates in humans. Subjects in our ongoing and planned clinical trials may suffer significant serious adverse events, including those that are drug-related, or other
	side effects not observed in our nonclinical studies, including, but not limited to, immune responses, organ toxicities such as liver, heart or kidney or other tolerability issues.

	Testing in animals, such as our primate studies in AEB1102, may not uncover all side effects in humans or any observed side effects in animals may be
	more severe in humans. For example, it is possible that patients&#146; immune systems may recognize our engineered human enzymes as foreign and trigger an immune response. This risk is heightened in patients who lack the target enzyme, as is the
	case with patients with Arginase I deficiency we will be treating in our planned Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 trials for this IEM. In addition, our product candidates such as AEB1102 break down target amino acids such as arginine, thereby
	releasing metabolites such as ornithine into the bloodstream. Some patients may be sensitive to these metabolites, increasing the risk of an adverse reaction due to treatment, which risk may not be able to be mitigated through dosing. Finally,
	although our engineered human enzyme product candidates such as AEB1102 are engineered from the human genome, AEB1102 is produced in
<I>
	E. coli
</I>
	. This manufacturing process could lead AEB1102 to be more likely to trigger an immune response than
	we expect.

	recruiting patients to the clinical trial, patients may drop out of our trial, or we may be required to abandon the trial or our development efforts of that product candidate altogether. Some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology
	industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in early-stage studies have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Even if the side effects do not preclude the drug from obtaining or maintaining marketing
	approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability versus other therapies. Any of these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.

	We may not be able to initiate or continue our planned clinical trials if we are unable to locate and enroll a
	sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA, EMA, MHRA or comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States. More specifically, many of our product candidates, including AEB1102, initially
	target indications that may be characterized as orphan&nbsp;markets, which can prolong the clinical trial&nbsp;timeline for the regulatory process if sufficient patients cannot be enrolled in a timely manner. Arginase I deficiency, for example, is
	the least common of the urea cycle disorders, with a reported incidence of 1:350,000 to 1:1,000,000 live births. Urea cycle disorders are the IEM found in the enzymes of the urea cycle, the process by which the human body detoxifies ammonia, a
	natural byproduct of protein metabolism. We believe that approximately 500-600 individuals in the United States and Europe suffer from Arginase I deficiency. While there is currently a neonatal blood test to screen for Arginase I deficiency, it has
	only been in broad use in the United States since 2006 and is not commonly used in Europe. We plan initially to treat patients who are 18 and older in the United States and 12 and older in Europe, and many in these age categories have not been
	screened for Arginase I deficiency, which may make it more difficult to enroll patients in our initial clinical trials for this indication. One urea cycle disorder physician consortium and one urea cycle disorder patient group have together
	identified an aggregate of approximately 20 patients with Arginase I deficiency in the United States and approximately 16 in Europe. Because neonatal blood testing for this disorder did not become common in the United States until 2006, we believe
	that approximately half of those identified in the United States are younger than 18, and thus would not be eligible for inclusion in our proposed Phase&nbsp;1 trial in the United States.

	patients two years of age and older in the United States in future clinical trials. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to enroll sufficient patients in our clinical trials or that the MHRA or FDA will permit us to enroll additional

	In addition, some patients with Arginase I deficiency suffer from heightened levels of ammonia, or
	hyperammonemia. Hyperion Therapeutics, Inc., which has been acquired by Horizon Pharma plc, has gained approval for its product RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate) to treat patients with urea cycle disorders suffering from hyperammonemia. Some
	patients who may be eligible for our planned clinical trials may instead pursue treatment for this effect of their condition by taking RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate) or through dietary protein restriction. Our inability to enroll a sufficient
	number of patients for any of our clinical trials could result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our
	product candidates and in delays to commercially launching our product candidates, if approved, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.

	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United
	States and Europe, may designate drugs or biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease
	or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Generally, if a product
	with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from approving
	another marketing application for the same drug for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the
	criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially
	defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	On March&nbsp;16, 2015, we obtained orphan drug designation in the United States for AEB1102 for the treatment of patients with hyperargininemia, also
	known as Arginase I deficiency. A company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years. This orphan drug
	exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to market a drug containing the same active moiety, or principal molecular structure, for the same orphan indication, except in very
	limited circumstances, including when the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a
	use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Even though we have received orphan drug designation for AEB1102
	for the treatment of Arginase I deficiency, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical product candidates. Further, even if we obtain
	orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition or a drug with the same active moiety can
	be approved for a different indication. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, even if we intend
	to seek orphan drug designation for other product candidates, we may never receive such designations or obtain orphan drug exclusivity.

	If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval,
	it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. For example, current cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation
	therapy are well established in the medical community, and physicians may continue to rely on these treatments instead of adopting the use of AEB1102 for the treatment of patients with arginine dependent cancers. In addition, many new drugs have
	been recently approved and many more are in the pipeline to treat patients with cancer. Additionally, current treatments for Arginase I deficiency include dietary protein restriction and, in some instances, ammonia-scavenging drugs such as RAVICTI
	(glycerol phenylbutyrate). If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may never generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if

	arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we intend to establish an internal sales or marketing team with technical expertise and
	supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and time consuming and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. Any failure or delay in the development of our

	We face intense competition from companies developing products to address urea cycle disorders. For
	example, Hyperion Therapeutics, Inc., which has been acquired by Horizon Pharma plc, has gained approval for its drug RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate), which is used to treat patients with urea cycle disorders suffering from hyperammonemia, which
	may sometimes include patients suffering from Arginase I deficiency. Patients with Arginase I deficiency may also benefit from taking RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate). We also face intense competition from companies developing products and

	The

	both in the United States and internationally, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government
	health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates.

	There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, the principal
	decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services since CMS decides whether and to what extent a new
	product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel products such as ours since there is no body of
	established practices and precedents for these new products. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. For example, a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the United States and have not been
	approved for reimbursement in certain European countries.

	Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price
	controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as our product
	candidates. In many countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In these countries, pricing negotiations with
	governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the
	cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. In general, the prices of products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for products,
	but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the
	reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and internationally, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may
	cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection
	with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general,
	particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the healthcare market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	In addition to CMS and private payors, professional organizations such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical
	Oncology can influence decisions about reimbursement for new products by determining standards for care. In addition, many private payors contract with commercial vendors who sell software that provide guidelines that attempt to limit utilization
	of, and therefore reimbursement for, certain products deemed to provide limited benefit to existing alternatives. Such organizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of our product candidates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Furthermore, some of our target indications, including for Arginase I deficiency for AEB1102, are orphan indications where patient populations are
	small. In order for therapeutics that are designed to treat smaller patient populations to be commercially viable, the reimbursement for such therapeutics must be higher, on a relative basis, to account for the lack of volume. Accordingly, we will
	need to implement a coverage and reimbursement strategy for any approved product candidate that accounts for the smaller potential market size. If we are unable to establish or sustain coverage and adequate reimbursement for any future product
	candidates from third-party payors, the adoption of those products and sales revenue will be adversely affected, which, in turn, could adversely affect the ability to market or sell those product candidates, if approved.

	With the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the
	approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as
	interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a BLA. On
	March&nbsp;6, 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA. However, the law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to
	uncertainty. While it is uncertain when the processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.

	Additionally, this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be
	substituted for any one of our reference products that may be approved in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that

	We do not currently have Fast Track Designation for any of our product candidates but intend to seek such designation for some or all of our product

	for FDA Fast Track Designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation. Even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it.
	Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no

	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA,
	changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for

	Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs
	surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a
	number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The U.S. PTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern
	administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear
	what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the
	enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations
	governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. In addition, there may be patent law reforms in foreign
	jurisdictions that could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents in those foreign jurisdictions.

	Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. PTO or patent offices in foreign jurisdictions, or become
	involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or
	litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or
	commercialize product candidates without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with
	us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.

	Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents,
	they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed

	to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and product candidates, or limit the
	duration of the patent protection of our technology and product candidates. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or
	shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to ours.

	addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent&#146;s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue
	on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We may also elect to enter into
	license agreements in order to settle patent infringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation, and any such license agreements may require us to pay royalties and other fees that could be significant. Furthermore, because of the

	Presently we have rights to intellectual property to develop our product candidates, including patents and patent applications we exclusively licensed

	discovery capabilities. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates. The
	licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider
	attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be
	unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain

	We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus. In particular, in this prospectus, we have not included all of the executive
	compensation related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot&nbsp;predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common
	stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended
	transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected
	not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

	As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we
	will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global
	Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management
	and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and
	costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain
	qualified members of our board of directors.

	We are evaluating these rules and regulations, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional
	costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new
	guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.

	reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm as required by Section&nbsp;404(b). To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal

	$17.00&nbsp;per share, the mid-point of the price range reflected on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately

	We are a biotechnology company committed to
	developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism that we believe will transform the lives of patients with inborn errors of metabolism and cancer. Our engineered human enzymes are designed to reduce the level of specific
	amino acids in the blood. In inborn errors of metabolism, or IEM, a subset of rare genetic metabolic diseases, we are seeking to reduce the toxic levels of amino acids in patients. In oncology, we are seeking to reduce amino acid blood levels below
	the normal range where we believe we will be able to exploit the dependence of certain cancers on specific amino acids.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Our lead product candidate,
	AEB1102, is engineered to degrade the amino acid arginine and is being developed to treat two extremes of arginine metabolism, including arginine excess in patients with Arginase I deficiency, an IEM, as well as some cancers which have shown to have
	a metabolic dependence on arginine. AEB1102 has demonstrated the ability to reduce blood arginine levels in nonclinical and clinical studies supporting its use as a potential treatment of both Arginase I deficiency and cancer.

	We were formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware in December 2013 and converted to a Delaware corporation in March
	2015. In connection with our conversion to a Delaware corporation, each of our outstanding shares of the members of the limited liability company was converted into shares of capital stock. On the date of conversion, the following conversions of
	limited liability shares took place: (i)&nbsp;each Series A convertible preferred share converted into one share of Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share; (ii)&nbsp;each Common A share converted into one share of common
	stock, par value $0.0001 per share; (iii)&nbsp;each Common A-1 share converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share; (iv)&nbsp;each Common B share with a threshold amount of $12.2 million converted into 0.7576&nbsp;shares of
	common stock and a grant of 0.2424 options to acquire one share of common stock; and (v)&nbsp;each Common&nbsp;B share with a threshold amount of $22.1&nbsp;million converted into 0.4242 shares of common stock and a grant of 0.5758 options to
	acquire one share of common stock. The threshold amount represents the amount which any distribution must cumulatively exceed before holders of the Common B shares participate pro rata with the holders of the Series A convertible preferred shares
	and Common&nbsp;A-1 and A shares in such distribution; however, holders of the Series A convertible preferred shares and Common&nbsp;A-1 and A shares are entitled to receive their distribution priority before the holders of the Common B shares would
	receive proceeds from any distribution.

	Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to identifying and
	developing product candidates, conducting nonclinical studies and initiating clinical trials, recruiting personnel and raising capital. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of convertible preferred and
	common equity securities and the collection of a research grant. We have no recorded revenue from product sales and all of our revenue to date has been grant revenue. Since our inception, and through December 31, 2015, we have raised an aggregate of
	$54.7 million to fund our operations through sale and issuance of convertible preferred and common equity securities and collection of $4.4 million in grant proceeds.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	We have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $1.9 million, $10.3 million and $11.3 million for the period from December
	16, 2013 (inception) through December 31, 2013 and the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from
	general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2015 totaled $33.1 million.

	To date, we have recognized revenue solely from a research grant and have not generated any product revenue. Our ability to generate product revenues,
	which we do not expect will occur for several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and eventual commercialization of our product candidates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	In June 2015, we entered into a grant agreement with the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, or CPRIT, for $19.8 million covering a three
	year period from June&nbsp;1, 2014 through May&nbsp;31, 2017. The grant allows us to receive funds in advance of costs and allowable expenses being incurred. We record the revenue as qualifying costs are incurred and there is reasonable assurance
	that the conditions of the award have been met for collection. Proceeds received prior to the costs being incurred are recognized as deferred revenue until the services are performed.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	On a quarterly basis, we are required to submit a financial reporting package outlining the nature and extent of reimbursable costs paid and requesting
	reimbursement under the grant. At the end of each period, expenses paid prior to reimbursement result in the recognition of a grant receivable.

	clinical research to obtain FDA and other regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development
	projects are discussed more fully in the section of this prospectus titled &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our
	research and development projects, or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval

	At inception, we acquired in-process research and development assets, consisting of patents and know-how
	used in connection with the development, manufacture, and commercialization of technology and future products incorporating the assigned intellectual property rights, from one of our founders in an asset acquisition. The in-process research and
	development assets were expensed immediately as research and development costs. As consideration for the assets, we issued 165,000 Common A-1 shares with a fair value of $277,000 and 200,714 Common A shares with a fair value of $232,000, and
	reimbursed prior intellectual property expenses of $237,000. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, we had an outstanding liability to or on behalf of the founder of $253,000, $0 and $0, respectively.

	The financing arrangement in connection with the sale and issuance of our Series A convertible preferred shares included a second closing in July 2014,
	which, for financial reporting purposes, resulted in a contract for the forward sale of an additional 837,594 Series A convertible preferred shares at a price of $5.25 per share, contingent upon certain milestones being met. This freestanding

	Since inception in December 2013,
	through March&nbsp;10, 2015, we were a Delaware LLC and elected to file as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes for the period from December&nbsp;16 (inception) through December&nbsp;31, 2013 and for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014. Our taxable losses from inception through December&nbsp;31, 2014 were allocated to the members in accordance with the LLC operating agreement. Accordingly, income taxes have not been provided for the period from December 16
	(inception) through December&nbsp;31, 2013 and the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, as the losses are included in the members&#146; federal income tax returns. On March&nbsp;10, 2015, we converted from a Delaware LLC to a Delaware corporation, and
	will file a corporate income tax return for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. For tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a corporation under Subchapter&nbsp;C of Chapter 1 of the United States Internal Revenue Code, effective January 1,
	2015. We therefore, are subject to federal and state tax expense beginning January 1, 2015.

	December&nbsp;31, 2015, we and our seven wholly-owned subsidiaries will file a consolidated corporate federal income tax return. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
	liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets to reduce
	their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Due to our lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.

	the technical merits, as the largest amount of benefits that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
	expense. To date, there have been no interest or penalties charged in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits.

	Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly
	because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and
	the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. We have the ability to hold our marketable securities until maturity, and
	therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments.

	Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been
	prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on
	various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically
	review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in our consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.

	pursuant to agreement established with CROs, CMOs and other outside service providers. These estimates are typically based on contracted amounts applied to the proportion of work performed and determined through analysis with internal personnel and
	external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services. We make significant judgements and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period. We record advance payments to CROs, CMOs or outside
	service providers as prepaid assets which are expensed as the contracted services are performed. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accruals. Inputs, such as the services performed, the number of patients enrolled, or the study duration,
	may vary from our estimates, resulting in adjustments to research and development expense in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to our accruals could materially affect our results of operations.

	In March 2015, upon conversion from a Delaware LLC to a Delaware corporation, we terminated the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and adopted the 2015 Equity
	Incentive Plan. The outstanding Common&nbsp;B shares were converted into restricted common stock and options to purchase common stock with no changes to the vesting provisions. The 355,156 awards outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, less

	&#150; Since we are privately held and do not have any trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded
	biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. When selecting comparable publicly traded biotechnology companies on which it has based its expected stock price volatility, we selected companies with
	comparable characteristics to us, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The historical volatility data was
	computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical
	information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.

	Historically, for all
	periods prior to this initial public offering, the fair values of our Common&nbsp;B awards and the common stock underlying our stock awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our
	Common B awards and common stock, our board of directors considered, among other things, the contemporaneous valuations of our Common B shares and common stock prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance
	provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide,&nbsp;
<I>
	Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation
</I>
	. Given the absence of a public trading market for our shares, our board of
	directors exercised substantial judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the estimated fair value of our shares, including our stage of development; progress of our research and development efforts; the
	rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred shares relative to those of our common shares; and the lack of marketability of our common shares.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	For the periods presented, the fair value of our Common B shares and common stock and other classes of shares were estimated using a market approach.
	There are multiple variations of the market approach. Our board of directors and the third-party valuation specialist utilized the Backsolve method, under which we and they considered the sales price of the convertible preferred shares to
	third-party investors and back-solved for our enterprise value.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	For valuations of our shares prior to our conversion to a Delaware corporation we
	utilized the option pricing method, or OPM, an accepted valuation method under the AICPA Practice Guide, to allocate the enterprise value determined under the market approach to each element of our capital structure, including our common shares. The
	OPM values each equity class by creating a series of call options on the equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences, participation rights and other rights.&nbsp;The OPM method requires significant assumptions; in
	particular, the time until investors in our company would experience an exit event and the volatility of our common shares. In addition, we applied a discount to the valuations due to the lack of marketability of the shares. The more significant
	inputs and assumptions we used in the models were our estimated equity value, the expected time until investors in our company would experience an exit event (three years), a risk-free interest rate (from 0.8% to 1.0%), the expected volatility (79%
	to 85%) and a discount for lack of marketability (35%).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	For valuations of our common stock following our conversion to a Delaware corporation, we
	utilized a hybrid approach of the probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM, and the OPM, an accepted valuation method under the AICPA Practice Guide, to allocate the enterprise value determined under the market approach to each element
	of our capital structure, including our common shares. The hybrid approach uses the PWERM to estimate the enterprise value under the market approach based on estimating a future value under multiple exit scenarios, going public at a high future
	equity value (with an early and late expected time to an exit event), going public at a low equity value (with an early and late expected time to an exit event), and remaining private with a later expected time to a liquidity event. The estimated
	enterprise value is then allocated to each class of equity, including common shares using the OPM or the PWERM. The PWERM was utilized in the going public scenarios and the OPM was utilized in the remaining private with a later liquidity scenario.
	The hybrid approach requires significant assumptions, in particular, the range of likely outcomes and their relative probability, the time until investors in our company would experience an exit event and the volatility of our common shares. In
	addition, we applied a discount to the valuations due to the lack of marketability of the shares.

	We are a biotechnology company committed to
	developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism that we believe will transform the lives of patients with inborn errors of metabolism and cancer. Our engineered human enzymes are designed to degrade specific amino acids in
	the blood. In inborn errors of metabolism, or IEM, a subset of rare genetic metabolic diseases, we are seeking to reduce the toxic levels of amino acids in patients. In oncology, we are seeking to reduce amino acid blood levels below the normal
	range where we believe we will be able to exploit the dependence of certain cancers on specific amino acids.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Our lead product candidate, AEB1102,
	is engineered to degrade the amino acid arginine and is being developed to treat two extremes of arginine metabolism, including arginine excess in patients with Arginase&nbsp;I deficiency, an IEM, as well as some cancers which have been shown to
	have a metabolic dependence on arginine. AEB1102 has demonstrated the ability to reduce blood arginine levels in clinical and nonclinical studies, supporting its potential use as a treatment of both Arginase I deficiency and cancer. We have an
	accepted investigational new drug application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for AEB1102 for the treatment of solid tumors. In October 2015, we initiated enrollment for this dose escalation trial in patients with
	advanced solid tumors. We have since treated our first two cohorts of seven patients total, and a temporary reduction of blood arginine was observed, providing initial human proof of mechanism for AEB1102. We have an effective IND and plan to
	initiate a Phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with hematological malignancies in the first half of 2016. We plan to initiate expansion trials in patients with solid tumors and an additional Phase&nbsp;1 trial in combination with the standard
	of care in one or more solid tumor types in 2017. In June 2015, we submitted an IND with the FDA for AEB1102 for Arginase&nbsp;I deficiency. We have an effective IND for a Phase 1 dose escalation study in adult Arginase I deficiency patients and
	anticipate starting enrollment in the first half of 2016. We anticipate submitting a clinical trial application, or CTA, to the EMA in the second half of 2016 for a Phase 2 trial in Arginase I deficiency patients and expect to initiate that trial in
	the first half of 2017. We are also building a pipeline of additional product candidates targeting key amino acids and other metabolites, including homocystine, a target for another IEM as well as cysteine/cystine and methionine in oncology.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	We believe amino acid metabolism is a largely unexploited area of pharmaceutical development. Amino acids are key components of metabolic processes that
	produce energy and enable cellular division and growth. Amino acids are also the building blocks of proteins which are critical to structural and functional elements of cells. Our goal is to engineer clinically meaningful human enzymes that act
	systemically on amino acids in the blood. Unlike microbial enzymes, we believe our engineered human enzymes will not be recognized as foreign by the body and will be less likely to elicit an immune response. The mechanism of action of our product
	candidates allows us to directly measure their activity by analyzing blood samples. We believe this approach will translate into a higher probability of clinical success for our product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	We are exploring the promise of this approach through the advancement of our arginine degrading human enzyme, AEB1102. In primate studies, we have
	observed a substantial reduction in arginine levels after dosing with AEB1102. In our first two cohorts of seven patients total in our Phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, we observed a temporary reduction in blood
	arginine, providing initial human proof of mechanism. The target of AEB1102, arginine, provides (i)&nbsp;proof of mechanism for the product candidate, (ii)&nbsp;a direct measure of target engagement for optimization of dose and schedule, and
	(iii)&nbsp;a direct mechanistic link to efficacy in nonclinical studies. We believe AEB1102 can be applied to address both the rare IEM genetic disease, Arginase I deficiency, as well as solid tumors and hematological malignancies that depend on
	circulating arginine for growth and survival. AEB1102 is covered by an issued composition of matter patent that expires in 2030.

	In addition to AEB1102, we have identified several other target amino acids that we believe will have
	clinical relevance in the treatment of IEM and cancer. Our pipeline of engineered human enzyme product candidates in nonclinical development includes: AEB3103, an enzyme that degrades the amino acids cysteine/cystine to target a widely recognized,
	but previously unexploited vulnerability of cancer to oxidative stress; AEB2109, an enzyme that degrades the amino acid methionine to target methionine dependent cancers and AEB4104, an engineered human enzyme to treat another IEM by degrading the
	amino acid homocystine. We plan to continue nonclinical development of AEB4104, AEB3103, AEB2109 and related variants of these candidates with the aim of submitting an IND for one or more of these development candidates in late 2017. Our current
	product candidates have been

	An integral part of our product development programs is a precision medicine strategy designed to identify patients that will benefit most from amino
	acid depletion therapy. For Arginase I deficiency and classical homocystinuria, widely adopted diagnostic tests are already incorporated into routine care in the form of a neonatal blood test. For oncology patients, researchers and clinical
	oncologists now often incorporate genetic and biomarker assessments into clinical trials and routine care with the hope of directing patients to therapies which may have a greater chance of success in treating their cancers. For AEB1102, biomarkers
	of tumor arginine dependence have shown value as a predictor of sensitivity to arginine depletion, and if appropriate, we plan to use those biomarkers to help us select the specific cancers to pursue in later clinical trials. We also have ongoing
	efforts for the identification of predictive biomarkers for the rest of the oncology pipeline. When warranted, we intend to develop companion diagnostics with the help of technology partners to aid in identifying patients whose tumors may be
	susceptible to amino acid depletion therapy.

	We are a patient-focused organization conscious of the fact that IEM and oncology patients have
	limited treatment options, and we recognize that their lives and well-being are highly dependent upon our efforts and the efforts of others to develop improved therapies. For this reason, we are passionate about discovering and developing
	therapeutics to address IEM and oncology indications where there is a significant unmet medical need. Our goal is to create a world class company committed to efficiently developing a portfolio of product candidates to treat these diseases.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:4PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Our company was founded to develop therapeutics for diseases characterized by abnormal amino acid metabolism. Metabolism refers to fundamental chemical
	reactions that are critical to life-sustaining processes. Metabolism follows specific pathways that are comprised of various biochemical reactions generally catalyzed by proteins known as enzymes. Enzymes accelerate complex reactions and serve as
	key regulators of metabolic pathways by responding to changes in the cell&#146;s environment or signals from other cells.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	An in-depth understanding
	of abnormal metabolic pathways is crucial to developing therapies that may address various disease states, including IEM and cancer. Our core capability of exploiting the metabolic pathways of IEM diseases has allowed us to develop engineered human
	enzyme therapies with the potential to reduce toxic levels of amino acids that may lead to novel, disease-modifying treatments for these rare diseases. In addition, with our focus on the innovative field of cancer cell metabolism, we strive to
	leverage our engineered human enzyme product candidates to degrade the key nutrients that promote cancer cell survival and proliferation.

	Enzymatic defects in metabolic processes contribute to a class of genetic diseases known as IEM. These are a
	broad group of more than hundreds of rare metabolic genetic diseases where the defect in a single metabolic enzyme disrupts the normal functioning of a metabolic pathway. These defects lead either to abnormal accumulation of upstream metabolites
	that may be toxic or interfere with normal function, or to a reduced ability to synthesize essential downstream metabolites.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Most of these diseases
	often have severe or life-threatening characteristics. The incidence of a single IEM often occurs in fewer than one per 100,000 live births. Many IEM are likely to be under-diagnosed. Current treatment options for many of these disorders are
	limited. Diet modification or nutrient supplementation can be beneficial in some IEM. Several of these disorders have been treated successfully with enzyme therapy. Some examples of this type of therapy for an IEM include Naglazyme (galsulfase) as a
	treatment for MPS 6 (mucopolysaccharidosis VI), or Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) as an enzyme replacement therapy for patients with Fabry disease (alpha-galactosidase A deficiency).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Our focus is on those IEM that are characterized by excess levels of amino acids and other metabolites that become toxic to patients. In these
	circumstances, we expect patients to benefit from reduced levels of the target amino acid or metabolite to a normal concentration range. We believe this can be successfully achieved through our enzyme replacement therapy. We are targeting a urea
	cycle disorder, Arginase I deficiency, for our lead product candidate, AEB1102. This cycle has the principle function of detoxifying ammonia, a normal byproduct of amino acid metabolism. Arginase I reduces arginine levels, and is the final step of
	the urea cycle, releasing urea for secretion by the kidney.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	We are developing AEB1102 to serve as an effective enzyme replacement therapy for
	patients with Arginase I deficiency, which leads to elevated levels of arginine in blood. While a protein restricted diet is part of the treatment regimen for Arginase I deficiency, it is not effective in normalizing blood arginine due to the
	body&#146;s continued production and processing of ammonia that results in continued production of arginine. Symptoms resulting from defects in the urea cycle metabolic pathway, such as increased levels of ammonia, have been the successful target of
	other drug development efforts including RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate) and BUPHENYL (sodium benzoate) which help to remove ammonia. Despite the acceptance of these drugs, they do not treat the underlying cause of the disease. We believe that
	AEB1102 represents a potential therapeutic candidate to treat the excess levels of arginine resulting from Arginase I deficiency.

	Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2015 there will be approximately
	1.7&nbsp;million new cases and approximately 589,000 deaths from cancer in the United States. Cancer originates from defects in the cell&#146;s genetic code, or DNA, that disrupt the mechanisms that normally prevent uncontrolled cell growth.

	The most common methods of treating patients with cancer include surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including biological products. A cancer patient
	often receives treatment with a combination of these modalities. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective in patients in whom the disease is localized. Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations in which the
	cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The goal of drug therapy is to damage and kill cancer cells or to interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the development, growth and
	survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has evolved from relatively non-specific chemotherapeutic drugs that kill both
	healthy and cancerous cells, to targeted therapies more specific to molecular pathways involved in the cancer.

	Beyond chemotherapeutics and targeted drug therapies, several new approaches to the development of novel cancer treatments are underway. These approaches
	include, but are not limited to treatment with drugs or other methods that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells, antibody drug conjugates that carry a powerful chemotherapy payload that is only released into targeted cancer cells,
	drugs that target the changes in gene activity that occur in cancer cells and drugs that target oncogenic drivers in patients with tumor types that harbor genetically similar alterations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	We believe that the altered metabolism of cancer cells&#151;the atypical uptake and break down of nutrients&#151;also provides an opportunity to develop
	important new cancer treatments. Cancer cells rapidly change how they take-up and utilize nutrients. These adaptations fuel tumor growth and protect cancer cells from the damage caused by reactive oxygen species, or ROS, and various immune system
	responses. However, while cancer cell metabolic abnormalities fuel tumor growth, they also expose vulnerabilities that can be targeted to selectively destroy tumor cells. It is our belief that depriving cancer cells of key amino acids that are
	essential for cell survival and tumor growth will provide an effective treatment for some cancers. While the dependence of different cancers on specific amino acids has been known for many years, it has not been widely exploited in the clinical
	setting.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Enzyme-based therapies that degrade amino acids have shown clinical benefit in the treatment of cancer. However, some microbial-derived
	enzymes present limitations. For example, Oncaspar (pegaspargase) and Erwinaze (Erwinia chrysanthemi) were approved as part of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Degrading the
	amino acid asparagine with an
<I>
	E. coli
</I>
	-derived enzyme, Oncaspar (pegaspargase) in combination with chemotherapy generates much improved remission rates as compared to chemotherapy alone. As reported in the scientific and clinical research
	literature, Oncaspar (pegaspargase) alone achieved complete remission rates of up to 60%; however the duration of remission is relatively short. In combination with chemotherapy, overall survival rates approach 90%. However, in some patients this
	regimen is poorly tolerated. In addition, tumor arginine dependence has been reported in the scientific and medical literature to result in responses to a microbial-derived arginine-degrading enzyme in patients in trials with acute myelogenous
	leukemia, mesothelioma, hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma. However, despite the reported clinical impact, the microbial arginine degrading enzyme elicited an immune response that neutralizes the activity of the drug and therefore may have
	limited clinical utility.

	seeking additional product candidates with the potential for efficient biomarker assisted development programs similar to our approach for AEB1102, and have ongoing efforts towards the identification of predictive biomarkers for our oncology

	There is no approved therapeutic agent that addresses the cause of Arginase I deficiency, although the medical
	literature suggests that disease progression can be slowed with strict adherence to dietary protein restriction. Dietary modification, which requires the use of specially formulated supplements, can reduce plasma arginine levels. This therapy is
	inadequate for treating the majority of patients with Arginase I deficiency, is difficult to manage, is poorly tolerated and is expensive. Therapy with the ammonia scavenging drugs RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate) or BUPHENYL (sodium benzoate) can
	be used to reduce elevated ammonia levels but does not appear to affect circulating arginine. Liver transplantation has been reported to be effective in patients to achieve normalization of arginine levels, but despite these successes, this
	intervention is available to only a small fraction of patients and carries a significant risk of mortality and morbidity.

	AEB1102 is intended to replace the function of Arginase I in patients, and return the elevated arginine levels to the normal physiological range.
	Normalization of arginine levels is anticipated to slow or halt the progression of disease in these patients. In two mouse genetic models of neonatal and adult Arginase&nbsp;I deficiency, AEB1102 was shown to be effective in lowering blood arginine.
	Also, as illustrated in the figure below, we conducted a nonclinical study in rats in which hyperargininemia was induced, whereby we observed decreases in blood arginine to normal levels for approximately 48 to 72 hours following dosing.

	We have obtained orphan drug designation in the United States for AEB1102 for the treatment of patients
	with Arginase&nbsp;I deficiency. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation for drugs or biologics designed to treat disorders affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. In October of 2015, we met with the FDA and the MHRA to discuss a
	potential Phase&nbsp;1 dose-escalation trial and Phase&nbsp;2 trial, respectively. We have an effective IND and, in the first half of 2016, we plan to initiate an open-label Phase&nbsp;1 dose-escalation trial in the United States in patients 18
	years of age and older to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in up to six patients with Arginase&nbsp;I deficiency. If the data from the Phase&nbsp;1 trial are supportive, we may seek to accelerate our development plan for AEB1102 by
	requesting to use established regulatory pathways, such as Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations. For our planned Phase&nbsp;2 trial in Europe, based on discussions with the MHRA, to support dosing patients ages two and older with AEB1102
	for the full duration of the Phase 2 trial in Europe, we will submit a total of six months of nonclinical toxicology data. We plan to initiate this Phase&nbsp;2 trial in Europe in the first half of 2017 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose and
	efficacy of intravenous administration of AEB1102 in up to ten patients with Arginase I deficiency, starting enrollment initially at age 12 and older. This Phase&nbsp;2 trial is intended to begin with a four-week observation period, followed by a
	dose escalation for approximately 12 weeks, or until arginine is normalized. We also intend to measure signs and symptoms of the disorder, including a quality-of-life assessment and neurocognitive measurements. If the data are favorable, patients in
	the Phase 2 trial will be eligible for a long-term extension study. We expect to complete enrollment of this trial in 2018. If the results from the trial are supportive, we anticipate initiating a randomized Phase&nbsp;3 trial enrolling

	We have met with the FDA on two occasions regarding the pathway for potential approval of AEB1102 for the treatment of Arginase I deficiency. Although
	the FDA recommended in our 2014 Pre-IND meeting that we measure age appropriate neurocognitive outcomes in our trials for marketing approval under the regular approval pathway, the FDA has agreed that the primary endpoint of our Phase&nbsp;2 and
	Phase 3 trials could be the normalization of blood arginine levels; provided that we can provide adequate justification that normalization of plasma arginine in the target population is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. To do this, we
	believe the FDA expects some evidence of consistent trends in the stabilization or improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of Arginase&nbsp;I deficiency to be observed in the Phase&nbsp;3 trial to support the primary endpoint. The FDA has
	suggested that we investigate multiple endpoints that can show a clinically meaningful benefit, such as neurocognitive outcomes and quality-of-life measurements, and not necessarily focus on achieving a statistically significant result (usually
	measured by a statistical value that indicates the likelihood that the result is not due to chance) on a single clinical endpoint, given the small number of patients expected to be enrolled in this trial. The FDA stated that the Phase&nbsp;3 trial
	length and design will need to be adequate to assess safety in the target population, stated that it is not clear that the time needed to show an effect on a biomarker will be an adequate duration to characterize safety and recommended that we reach
	agreement with the FDA on the duration of such a trial if we decide to pursue an accelerated approval development plan. Finally, if we obtain accelerated approval, we will be required to conduct a post-approval controlled trial that verifies
	clinical benefit in neurocognitive outcomes, and the FDA has stated that it expects the verification study to be underway at the time of accelerated approval. With respect to Arginase I&nbsp;deficiency, we do not expect to need FDA regulatory
	approval of any diagnostic test prior to obtaining approval, if any, of AEB1102 for that indication. A diagnostic test for Arginase I&nbsp;deficiency already exists in the form of a widely adopted neonatal blood test that is a part of mandatory
	newborn screening in 49 U.S. states and incorporated into routine care for diagnosis and treatment of patients with Arginase&nbsp;I&nbsp;deficiency.

	We are planning to target the dependence of some cancers on the amino acid arginine using AEB1102. Arginine is considered a semi-essential amino acid
	since in some circumstances cells cannot make sufficient amounts of arginine. These circumstances include conditions of enhanced proliferation, tissue injury or stress. The role of arginine and its metabolites in cancer has been studied extensively
	in nonclinical models with demonstrated effects, including enhancement of tumor growth and cellular proliferation. Conversely, restriction of dietary arginine attenuates tumor growth and metastasis in experimental tumor models.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Many types of cancers lose the ability to synthesize intracellular arginine, principally due to deficiency in the expression of any one or more of the
	following enzymes&#151;ornithine transcarbamoylase, or OTC, argininosuccinate synthase, or ASS and argininosuccinate lyase, or ASL. As a result, these cancers depend on extracellular arginine uptake. When deprived of this tumor-essential nutrient,
	cancer cells die, establishing a correlation between their inability to synthesize arginine and vulnerability to arginine deprivation. As set forth in the figure below, based on data from our nonclinical studies and the published scientific and
	medical literature, Arginase I degrades arginine to ornithine and urea. Ornithine cannot be used to make arginine by any cancer cells that lack expression of OTC, ASS or ASL.

	any one or more of the enzymes OTC, ASS or ASL in tumor cells has been shown to be a predictive biomarker for arginine dependent cancer cells. The chart below summarizes data from human tumor sample studies from published scientific and medical
	literature. Each solid bar identifies the tumor type and the percent of tumors that were found to have one or more of the biomarkers predicting arginine dependence. The number of different patient tumor samples tested is displayed in the column on

	With an effective IND for AEB1102 for the treatment of solid tumors we initiated enrollment and treated our first two cohorts of seven patients total in
	a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with two stages: dose escalation and expansion. The primary objectives of the dose escalation stage are to determine the optimal biological dose, which will be based on changes in the target, blood arginine, as well
	as to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of AEB1102. The inclusion criteria include patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed standard treatment for their disease. This includes adult patients with tumors that
	are locally advanced or metastatic that have progressed, have been nonresponsive to available therapies or for which no standard or available therapy exists. We expect that between 24-48 patients will be enrolled in the dose-escalation portion of
	the trial, depending on the number of dose levels studied and the adverse effects observed. We have an effective IND and intend to initiate an additional Phase&nbsp;1 trial for hematological malignancies in the first half of 2016. We expect that up
	to 48 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation portion of this trial and an additional ten patients will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose level to further evaluate safety at this dose level. At the end of our Phase 1 dose escalation
	in solid tumors, we intend to initiate expansion arms in different tumor types, which we have yet to determine. We anticipate up to 60-75 patients may be enrolled in these three expansion arms. The primary objective of the expansion phase is to
	assess safety and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity across multiple tumor types. An additional Phase&nbsp;1 expansion trial will evaluate AEB1102 in combination with a standard of care in one or more solid tumor types.

	Reactive oxygen species, or ROS, have been widely reported in the scientific and clinical research literature to have enhanced production in tumors
	creating oxidative stress, resulting in damage to lipids, membranes, structural and functional proteins and DNA. Major sources of oxidative stress in cancer include: metabolic activities due to aberrant growth-promoting pathways, infiltrating
	inflammatory cells, as well as standards of care such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Glutathione is a key natural protector of ROS-mediated damage and has an enhanced role in protecting tumor cells from high levels of ROS. To survive in this
	hostile environment, cancer cells produce high levels of glutathione which preferentially reacts with and neutralizes the otherwise damaging ROS. Glutathione cannot be transported into cells from outside the cell, and must be synthesized in each
	cell. In order to satisfy the tumor&#146;s demand for glutathione, an adequate supply of cysteine/cystine is required. Reducing available cysteine/cystine from outside the cell decreases the levels of glutathione, increasing ROS-related damage to
	cancer cells and triggering cancer cell death.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	The production of ROS is both an initiator as well as a promoter of cancer, requiring increased
	production of glutathione for cancer survival. However, many cancer treatments are also cytotoxic through the production of ROS. This apparent paradox is receiving increased attention as a potential tumor vulnerability, and underlies the mechanistic
	rationale for selective tumor killing by using a therapeutic enzyme to reduce available cysteine/cystine in the blood. While chemotherapy and radiation therapies are often highly efficient at eliminating the bulk of cancer cells, treatment resistant
	cancer stem cells are highly resistant to ROS mediated damage and survive anti-cancer therapy. These cancer stem cells are thought to be a cause of patient relapse.

	an extensive body of evidence from the scientific and clinical research literature, we believe targeting the glutathione dependence of cancer will not only have direct anti-tumor activity but may also show synergy in combination with standards of
	care, depleting the cancer stem cells to provide a prolonged benefit to patients.

	the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and
	third-party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent

	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as

	After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of
	the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#146;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of
	preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,374,000 for U.S. Government Fiscal Year 2016, and the applicant under an approved BLA is
	also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment for U.S. Government Fiscal Year 2016. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its
	receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA
	begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologic products are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the BLA; most applications for
	priority review biologics are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the BLA. Priority review can be applied to a biologic that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved,
	would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted
	information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.

	The FDA may also refer applications for novel
	biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee&#151;typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts&#151;for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to
	whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to
	assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is
	satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the indication studied.

	After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response

	satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial
	marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic
	outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare

	In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct
	measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance
	requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will
	allow the FDA to withdraw the biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

	It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device&#146;s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other
	things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and
	adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces
	reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer&#146;s facilities for compliance with the Quality System
	Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.

	PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not
	approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the
	PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant&#146;s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in
	order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can
	include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.

	After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and

	comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and

	return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include
	anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions
	and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or
	recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal

	Significant
	uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for
	commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs,
	private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for
	establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a
	particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy.
	We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be
	considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a
	product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in
	product development.

	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things,
	clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of
	clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human
	clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country&#146;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial
	application is approved in accordance with a country&#146;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:4PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Our 2015 Equity Incentive
	Plan was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on March&nbsp;10, 2015. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock options, which qualify for favorable tax treatment to their recipients
	under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, and nonstatutory stock options, as well as for the issuance of shares of restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units. We may grant incentive stock options only to our employees,
	including officers and directors who are also employees. We may grant nonstatutory stock options to our employees, officers, directors and consultants. The exercise price of each stock option must be at least equal to the fair market value of our
	common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted to 10% stockholders must be at least equal to 110% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum permitted term of options
	granted under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is ten years, except that the maximum permitted term of incentive stock options granted to 10% stockholders is five years. In the event of our merger or consolidation, the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan
	provides that awards may be assumed, converted or replaced by the successor or acquiring entity. Unless as otherwise approved by our board of directors or required by the terms of any option agreement governing such options, all unexercised options
	shall terminate upon the consummation of the merger or consolidation if they are not assumed or substituted.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	As of December 31, 2015, we had
	reserved 1,228,714 shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2015, options to purchase 4,580 of these shares had been exercised, options to purchase 629,848 of these shares remained outstanding
	and 594,286 of these shares remained available for future grant. The options outstanding as of December 31, 2015 had a weighted-average exercise price of $4.55 per share. We will cease issuing awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan upon the
	implementation of our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. We will not grant any additional options under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan following the date of this prospectus, and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will terminate at that time. However, any
	outstanding options granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will remain outstanding, subject to the terms of our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and stock option agreements, until such outstanding options are exercised or until they terminate or
	expire by their terms. As of December 31, 2015, no restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights or restricted stock units have been granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan but should any such awards be granted, they will have terms
	similar to those described below with respect to such awards to be granted under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan.

	Our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws that will become effective in connection
	with the closing of this offering require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law and allow us to indemnify other employees and agents as set forth in the Delaware
	General Corporation Law. Subject to certain limitations, our restated bylaws also require us to advance expenses incurred by our directors and officers for the defense of any action for which indemnification is required or permitted.

	We have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into separate indemnification agreements with our directors, officers and certain of our key
	employees, in addition to the indemnification provided for in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify our directors, officers and key employees for certain
	expenses, including attorneys&#146; fees, judgments, penalties, fines and settlement amounts actually incurred by these individuals in any action or proceeding arising out of their service to us or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or
	enterprise to which these individuals provide services at our request. Subject to certain limitations, our indemnification agreements also require us to advance expenses incurred by our directors, officers and key employees for the defense of any

	The limitation

	reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder&#146;s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that
	we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions.

	The policy provides that any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, nominee for election as a director, beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock or with any of their immediate family members or
	affiliates in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 will be presented to our audit committee for review, consideration and approval. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our audit committee will consider the relevant facts and

	when evaluating the transaction and in determining whether such transaction was fair to the company and in the best interest of all of our stockholders.

	Any dividend paid to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock that is not effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder&#146;s

	States and the non-U.S. holder&#146;s country of residence. You should consult your tax advisors regarding your entitlement to benefits under a relevant income tax treaty. Generally, in order for us or our paying agent to withhold tax at a lower
	treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must certify its entitlement to treaty benefits. A non-U.S. holder generally can meet this certification requirement by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or any successor of such forms) or appropriate
	substitute form to us or our paying agent. If the non-U.S. holder holds the stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on the holder&#146;s behalf, the holder will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent. The
	holder&#146;s agent will then be required to provide certification to us or our paying agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. If you are eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax under an income tax treaty, you may
	obtain a refund or credit of any excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS in a timely manner.

	The Code and the Treasury regulations require those who make specified payments to report the payments to the IRS. Among the specified payments are
	dividends and proceeds paid by brokers to their customers. The required information returns enable the IRS to determine whether the recipient properly included the payments in income. This reporting regime is reinforced by &#147;backup
	withholding&#148; rules. These rules require the payors to withhold tax from payments subject to information reporting if the recipient fails to cooperate with the reporting regime by failing to provide his taxpayer identification number to the
	payor, furnishing an incorrect identification number, or failing to report interest or dividends on his returns. The backup withholding tax rate is currently 28%. The backup withholding rules do not apply to payments to corporations, whether

	status as a non-U.S. holder (and we or our paying agent do not have actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a U.S. person or that the conditions of any other exemption are not, in fact, satisfied) or otherwise establishes an exemption. The

	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to close
	out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared with the price at which they may purchase shares through exercise of their option. If the
	underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by exercise of their option and, therefore, have a naked short position, the position can be closed out only by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created
	if the underwriters are concerned that after pricing there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

	In our

	fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in
	the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an
	opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
	perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	Aeglea
	BioTherapeutics, Inc. (&#147;Aeglea&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing enzyme-based therapeutics in the field of amino acid metabolism that it believes will transform the lives of
	patients with cancer and inborn errors of metabolism, a subset of rare genetic metabolic diseases. The Company operates in one segment and has its principal offices in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	The Company, founded as Aeglea BioTherapeutics Holdings, LLC (&#147;Aeglea LLC&#148;), was formed as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) in Delaware on
	December&nbsp;16, 2013 and was converted from a Delaware LLC to a Delaware corporation (the &#147;LLC Conversion&#148;) on March&nbsp;10, 2015. Except where the context otherwise requires or as otherwise indicated, references to the Company prior to
	the conversion refer to Aeglea LLC. The LLC Conversion was effective January 1, 2015 for tax purposes and as such, the Company will file a consolidated tax return for the full year ended December 31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	In connection with the LLC Conversion, all of the equity interests in Aeglea LLC, which consisted of Series A convertible preferred shares,
	Class&nbsp;A-1 common shares, Class&nbsp;A common shares and Class&nbsp;B common shares, were converted into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock or shares of common stock in the Company. Each Series A convertible preferred share was
	converted into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at a ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. Each Class&nbsp;A-1 common share and Class&nbsp;A common share was converted into shares of common stock at a ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. Class&nbsp;B common shares
	were converted at various ratios depending upon the issuance date of the relevant shares. Vested and unvested Class B common shares of 353,682 were converted into 253,232 shares of vested and unvested restricted common stock and 100,446 vested and
	unvested options to acquire common stock (see Note 6 and 9).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	Since inception, the Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flow
	from operations and has no product revenue to date. The Company expects to incur significant expenses, increasing operating losses, and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. The Company expects its expenses to increase in
	connection with conducting additional non-clinical studies, conducting clinical trials of its product candidates, seeking regulatory approval for its product candidates and commercializing its product candidates, if approved. The Company may never
	achieve profitability and, as such, will need to raise additional cash. Accordingly, it will seek to fund its operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as research grants. The Company recorded net losses
	of $10.3 million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $12.3 million and $23.6 million, and net working capital of $1.7 million and $35.8 million as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The Company has funded its operations primarily through the sale and issuance of convertible preferred shares/stock and common shares/stock and the collection of a research grant. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, the Company had capital resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $2.6 million and $33.1 million, respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
	liabilities in the normal course of business. In March 2015, the Company issued 4.9 million shares of Series B convertible preferred stock for $44.0 million in gross proceeds (see Note&nbsp;6). The Company intends on raising additional capital
	through the issuance of additional equity and potentially through strategic alliances with partner companies. The Company believes that it has sufficient resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:4PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such management estimates include those related to accruals of research and development related costs, fair values of preferred and common shares and preferred and
	common stock, a forward sale contract, share-based compensation, and certain company subsidiary income tax related items. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	The Company utilized significant estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of its Common Stock, Common A-1 shares, Common A
	shares, and Common B shares, and the forward sale contract for Series A Convertible Preferred Shares. The board of directors determined the estimated fair value of each class of common shares and the common stock based on a number of objective and
	subjective factors, including external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector, the price at which the Company sold shares of convertible preferred shares, the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to each of the
	Company&#146;s common shares classes, and the marketability at the time. The Company utilized either a hybrid of the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (&#147;PWERM&#148;) and the Option Pricing Method (&#147;OPM&#148;) or the OPM; both
	valuation methodologies are based on the Backsolve Method, a form of the market approach, in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
<I>
	Audit and Accounting Practice Aid Series: Valuation of Privately Held Company
	Securities Issued as Compensation
</I>
	, to estimate the fair value of each class of common shares and common stock. The hybrid valuation methodology applied the PWERM utilizing the probability of going public scenarios and a liquidation scenario. The
	OPM valuation methodology included estimates and assumptions that require the Company&#146;s judgment and considers the respective rights of each class of common shares and common stock. Significant changes to the key assumptions used in the
	valuations could result in different fair values of Common Stock, Common A-1, Common A, and Common B shares as of the valuation date (See Notes&nbsp;6, 7, 9, and 10).

	The product candidates being
	developed by the Company require approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or foreign regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales. There can be no assurance that the Company&#146;s product candidates will receive the necessary
	approvals. If the Company is denied regulatory approval of its product candidates, or if approval is delayed, it may have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s business, results of operations and its financial position.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, risks related to the successful
	discovery and development of drug candidates, raising additional capital, development of competing drugs and therapies, protection of proprietary technology and market acceptance of the Company&#146;s products. As a result of these and other factors
	and the related uncertainties, there can be no assurance of the Company&#146;s future success.

	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. There were no realized gains or losses on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. Interest on marketable securities is included in interest

	restrictions on maturities. The Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash are held by financial institutions in the United States that management believes are of high credit quality. Amounts on deposit may at
	times exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents and its accounts are monitored by management to mitigate risk. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of
	default by the financial institutions holding its cash and cash equivalents and bond issuers to the extent recorded in the balance sheets.

	manufacturing organizations (&#147;CMOs&#148;), and other outside service providers for which payment flows do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to the Company. Accruals are recorded based on estimates of services
	received and efforts expended pursuant to agreements established with CROs, CMOs, and other outside service providers. These estimates are typically based on contracted amounts applied to the proportion of work performed and determined through
	analysis with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services. The Company makes significant judgements and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period. In the
	event advance payments are made to a CRO, CMO, or outside service provider, the payments will be recorded as a prepaid asset which will be amortized as the contracted services are performed. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its
	accruals. Inputs, such as the services performed, the number of patients enrolled, or the study duration, may vary from the Company&#146;s estimates, resulting in adjustments to research and development expense in future periods. Changes in these

	The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities and to determine
	fair value disclosures. The accounting standards define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and require disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an
	asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the principal or most
	advantageous market in which the Company would transact are considered along with assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	The accounting standard for fair value establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, the first two of which are considered
	observable and the last unobservable, that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument&#146;s categorization within the fair value
	hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

	As of December 31, 2015, the Company held five debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position for less than one year. The aggregate fair value
	of debt securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2015 was $2.5 million with no individual securities in a significant unrealized loss position. The Company evaluated its securities for other-than-temporary impairment and considered
	the decline in market value for the securities to be primarily attributable to current economic and market conditions. It is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities, and the Company does not intend to do so
	prior to the recovery of the amortized cost basis. Based on this analysis, these marketable securities were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2015.

	On December&nbsp;24, 2013, the Company raised $5.1 million through the issuance of 971,928 Series&nbsp;A convertible preferred shares at $5.25 per share.
	The financing arrangement included a contract for the forward sale of an additional 837,594 Series A convertible preferred shares at a price of $5.25 per share, contingent upon certain milestones being met. This freestanding financial instrument was
	classified as a liability because the underlying preferred shares are contingently redeemable. The fair value of the forward sale contract at issuance was $440,000. The fair value of the forward sale contract at settlement on July&nbsp;15, 2014 was
	$1.9 million.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">

	On March&nbsp;10, 2015, the Company converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a
	Delaware corporation and changed the Company&#146;s name from Aeglea BioTherapeutics Holdings, LLC to Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. In connection with the LLC Conversion, all of the Company&#146;s outstanding common shares and convertible preferred
	shares were converted into shares of common stock and convertible preferred stock. Further, the outstanding Common B share awards were converted into a combination of vested and unvested restricted common stock and vested and unvested stock options
	with no changes to the vesting provisions (see Note 9). Upon the LLC Conversion, each then-outstanding Series A convertible preferred share was converted into one share of Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The
	Company determined that the LLC Conversion resulted in a deemed dividend from stockholders of common stock to stockholders of Series A convertible preferred stock of $0.11 per share of Series A convertible preferred stock. The Company recorded
	$228,000 as an increase in the carrying amount of the Series A convertible preferred stock and as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Such dividend was determined by comparing the fair value of the Series A convertible preferred shares
	immediately prior to the conversion to the fair value of the Series A convertible preferred stock issued in the conversion.

	As discussed in Note 6, in connection with the LLC Conversion on March&nbsp;10, 2015, the 355,156 Common B share awards outstanding as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014, less subsequent forfeitures of 1,474 shares, were converted into a combination of 253,232 vested and unvested shares of restricted common stock and 100,446 vested and unvested options to purchase common stock (collectively
	&#147;the Replacement Awards&#148;) with no changes to the vesting provisions. The modification affected 7 employees.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	In accordance with ASC
	718, the Company determined the fair value of the Common B share awards held by employees and nonemployees immediately before the Replacement Awards were issued and compared that amount to the then fair value of the Replacement Awards. Given there
	was no incremental fair value in connection with the issuance of the Replacement Awards, the Company continues to recognize the compensation expense originally estimated for the Common B shares at the date of grant. The original Common B share
	values were allocated to stock options and restricted stock awards based on proportionate conversion date fair values.

	Since the Company is privately held and does not have any trading history for its common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the
	average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. When selecting comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies on which it has based its
	expected stock price volatility, the Company selected companies with comparable characteristics to it, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the
	expected life of the stock-based awards. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. The
	Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available.

	The Company utilized either a hybrid of the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (&#147;PWERM&#148;) and the Option Pricing Method
	(&#147;OPM&#148;) or the OPM, both valuation methodologies are based on the Backsolve Method, a form of the market approach, to estimate the fair value of each class of common shares, preferred shares, and common stock. The hybrid valuation
	methodology applied the PWERM utilizing the probability of going public scenarios and a liquidation scenario. The OPM valuation methodology included estimates and assumptions that require the Company&#146;s judgment. Inputs used to determine
	estimated fair value of the shares include the equity value of the Company, probabilities of going public by term (from 12.5% to 80% with terms from 0.55 to 0.13 years), risk-adjusted discount rate (30%), discount for lack of marketability (from 30%
	to 7.5%), expected timing of the liquidity event (from 2.8 to 3.0 years), a risk-free interest rate (from 0.8% to 1.1%) and the expected volatility (70%). Generally, increases or decreases in these unobservable inputs would result in a directionally
	similar impact to the fair value measurement of the Company&#146;s shares.

	The fair value of the forward sale contract for Series A convertible
	preferred shares was measured using a probability-weighted discount approach. Inputs used to determine estimated fair value of the forward sale contract include the estimated present and future fair values of the Series A convertible preferred
	shares, the estimated probability of the milestone being achieved (initially 90%), the discount rate (20%), and an estimated time to the milestone event (initially estimated to be ten months). Increases or decreases in the discount rate generally
	would result in a directionally opposite impact to the fair value measurement of this forward sale contract. Changes in the estimated fair value of the Series A convertible preferred shares generally would result in a directionally similar impact on
	the fair value measurement of the forward sale contract.

	The Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset due to uncertainties regarding the
	realization of the deferred tax asset based on the Company&#146;s lack of earnings history. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $3.0 million and $3.9 million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, respectively,
	primarily due to continuing loss from operations.

	The Company has not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether
	there have been multiple ownership changes since the Company&#146;s formation due to the complexity and cost associated with such a study, and the fact that there may be additional such ownership changes in the future. If the Company has experienced
	an ownership change at any time since its formation, utilization of the NOL or R&amp;D credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 or 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, which is determined by first multiplying
	the value of the Company&#146;s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term, tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. Additionally, the separate return limitation year
	(&#147;SRLY&#148;) rules may apply to losses of the Company&#146;s seven wholly-owned subsidiary corporations. The SRLY rules limit the consolidated group&#146;s use of a subsidiary corporation&#146;s net operating losses to the amount of income
	generated by the subsidiary corporation after it becomes a member of the group. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL or R&amp;D credit carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any
	limitation known, no amounts are being considered as an uncertain tax position or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. Additionally, the Company does not expect any unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months.
	Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, future changes in the Company&#146;s unrecognized tax benefits will not impact its effective tax rate. Any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be
	removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance.

	The Company computes net loss allocable per common shareholder and stockholder using the two-class method required for participating securities. The
	Company considers convertible preferred shares/stock to be participating securities. In the event that the Company paid out distributions, holders of convertible preferred shares/stock would participate in the distribution.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:3%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL">
	The two-class method is an earnings (loss) allocation method under which earnings (loss) per share is calculated for each class of common share, common
	stock, and participating security considering a participating security&#146;s rights to undistributed earnings (loss) as if all such earnings (loss) had been distributed during the period. The convertible preferred shares/stock do not have an
	obligation to fund losses and are therefore excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share. Starting in the first quarter of 2015 in connection with the LLC Conversion, the Company&#146;s Series&nbsp;A and B convertible preferred stock
	are entitled to receive noncumulative dividends and in preference to any dividends on shares of the Company&#146;s common stock.

	Basic and diluted
	net loss per share allocable to common shareholders and stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to the applicable class of common share and common stock by the weighted-average number of that class of common share and common stock
	outstanding during the period. For net loss per share allocable to common stockholders for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the effect of the LLC Conversion is presented prospectively from January&nbsp;1, 2015 as none of the losses for the
	year ended December 31, 2015 will be allocated to the members of Aeglea LLC. For periods in which the Company generated a net loss, the Company does not include the potential impact of dilutive securities in diluted net loss per share, as the impact
	of these items is anti-dilutive. Additionally, the convertible preferred stock dividend is included in the loss allocable to common stockholders.

	forth in the Registrant&#146;s restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections. There is no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director or executive officer of the Registrant for

	. Subject to Sections 2.6 and 21 and any other applicable provisions hereof, the total number of
	Shares reserved and available for grant and issuance pursuant to this Plan as of the date of adoption of the Plan by the Board, is 1,100,000, plus that number of reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the Company&#146;s

	Shares subject to Awards, and Shares issued under the Plan under any Award, will again be available for grant and issuance in connection with subsequent Awards under this Plan to the extent such Shares: (a)&nbsp;are subject to issuance upon exercise
	of an Option or SAR granted under this Plan but which cease to be subject to the Option or SAR for any reason other than exercise of the Option or SAR; (b)&nbsp;are subject to Awards granted under this Plan that are forfeited or are repurchased by
	the Company at the original issue price; (c)&nbsp;are subject to Awards granted under this Plan that otherwise terminate without such Shares being issued; or (d)&nbsp;are surrendered pursuant to an Exchange Program. To the extent an Award under the
	Plan is paid out in cash or other property rather than Shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an Award or withheld to satisfy the tax
	withholding obligations related to an Award will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, Shares that otherwise become available for grant and issuance because of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.2
	shall not include Shares subject to Awards that initially became available because of the substitution clause in Section&nbsp;21.2 hereof.

	Method of Exercise
</U>
	. Any Option granted hereunder will be vested and exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option
	may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (a)&nbsp;notice of exercise (in such form as the Committee may specify from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise the Option,
	and (b)&nbsp;full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (together with applicable withholding taxes). Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Committee and permitted by the
	Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer
	agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly
	after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section&nbsp;2.6 of the Plan. Exercising an Option in any manner will
	decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.

	assumption will be permissible if the holder of the substituted or assumed award would have been eligible to be granted an Award under this Plan if the other company had applied the rules of this Plan to such grant. In the event the Company assumes
	an award granted by another company, the terms and conditions of such award will remain unchanged (

</U>
	that the Purchase Price or the Exercise Price, as the case may be, and the number and nature of Shares issuable upon exercise or
	settlement of any such Award will be adjusted appropriately pursuant to Section&nbsp;424(a) of the Code). In the event the Company elects to grant a new Option in substitution rather than assuming an existing option, such new Option may be granted
	with a similarly adjusted Exercise Price. Substitute Awards shall not be credited toward the number of Shares authorized for grant under the Plan or authorized for grant to a Participant in a calendar year.

	Prior to the settlement of your RSUs, you shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company

	2. ESTABLISHMENT OF PLAN.
</B>
	The Company proposes to grant rights to

	The Plan will be administered by the Committee. Subject to the provisions of this Plan and the limitations of
	Section&nbsp;423 of the Code or any successor provision in the Code, all questions of interpretation or application of this Plan shall be determined by the Committee and its decisions shall be final and binding upon all eligible employees and
	Participants. The Committee will have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret and apply the terms of this Plan, to determine eligibility, to designate the Participating Corporations, to determine whether Participating
	Corporations shall participate in the Section&nbsp;423 Component or Non-Section&nbsp;423 Component and to decide upon any and all claims filed under the Plan. Every finding, decision and determination made by the Committee will, to the full extent
	permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan, the Committee may adopt rules, sub-plans, and/or procedures relating to the operation and administration of this Plan designed to
	comply with local laws, regulations or customs or to achieve tax, securities law or other objectives for eligible employees outside of the United States. The Committee will have the authority to determine the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock
	(which determination shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes) in accordance with Section&nbsp;8 below and to interpret Section&nbsp;8 of this Plan in connection with circumstances that impact the Fair Market Value. Members of the
	Committee shall receive no compensation for their services in connection with the administration of this Plan, other than standard fees as established from time to time by the Board for services rendered by Board members serving on Board committees.
	All expenses incurred in connection with the administration of this Plan shall be paid by the Company. For purposes of this Plan, the Committee may designate separate offerings under the Plan (the terms of which need not be identical) in which
	eligible employees of one or more Participating Corporations will participate, even if the dates of the applicable Offering Periods of each such offering are identical.
