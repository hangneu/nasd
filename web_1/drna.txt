	We are an RNA

	Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1).

	We are developing DCR-PH1 for the treatment of PH1 by targeting the gene encoding the liver enzyme glycolate oxidase. PH1 is known to afflict an estimated one to three people
	per million of population, and may afflict as many as six to eight people per million of population, and causes severe renal disease and early mortality. In pre-clinical studies, we have shown that, by using our RNAi technology to inactivate the
	gene encoding glycolate oxidase, we can significantly reduce oxalate levels, the key pathology of PH1. In December 2015, we initiated dosing in our first PH1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers, and we expect to begin our first Phase 1 study
	of DCR-PH1 in patients with PH1 in the first half of 2016. In January 2016, we enrolled our first patient in an international, multicenter, observational study designed to measure biomarkers implicated in PH1. Although the observational study will
	not include investigational drugs or other interventions, its participants may be considered for enrollment in planned clinical trials of DCR-PH1. We are using our DsiRNA-EX Conjugate technology to develop a subcutaneously injected treatment for PH1
	and intend to declare a clinical candidate in the first half of 2016.

	the MYC gene with DCR-MYC has shown strong anti-tumor effects in animal models of human cancers. In the second quarter of 2014, we initiated a multi-center, dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical study
	of DCR-MYC to assess the safety and tolerability of DCR-MYC in patients with solid tumors, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma who are refractory or unresponsive to standard therapies. In the second quarter of 2015, we announced interim data from this
	trial, including signs of clinical and metabolic response and tumor shrinkage in two PNET patients. Based on these observations, we announced our intention to expand this on-going phase 1 trial to include a cohort of patients with PNETs. In
	addition, once the optimal dose of DCR-MYC has been determined, we plan to initiate enrollment of a cohort of patients who will undergo pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies. Molecular analysis of the MYC gene transcript in these biopsies will
	allow direct observation of the RNAi-mechanism of action of DCR-MYC. We expect to announce data from the PNET and biopsy cohorts in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated a global Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of DCR-MYC in patients with
	advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dose escalation will continue until determination of the MTD, at which point we will initiate an expansion cohort at MTD that includes pre- and post-treatment biopsies, as well as the Phase 2 portion of the
	study. Molecular analysis of the MYC gene transcript in tumor biopsies will allow direct observation of the RNAi-mechanism of action of DCR-MYC in HCC. We expect to report proof-of-concept data for DCR-MYC in the second half of 2016 based on
	anticipated results from our two ongoing trials.

	Our drug discovery and development efforts are based on the therapeutic modality of RNAi, a highly potent and specific mechanism for silencing
	the activity of a targeted gene. In this naturally occurring biological process, double-stranded RNA molecules induce the enzymatic destruction of the messenger RNA (mRNA) of a target gene that contains sequences that are complementary to one strand
	of the therapeutic double-stranded RNA molecule. Our approach is to design proprietary double-stranded RNA molecules that have the potential to engage the enzyme Dicer and initiate an RNAi process to silence a specific target gene. We refer to these
	proprietary molecules generally as Dicer substrate short interfering RNAs (DsiRNAs), or as DsiRNA or DsiRNA-EX molecules, depending on the specific structure.

	RNAi therapeutics represent a novel advance in drug development. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry has developed small molecules or
	antibodies to inhibit the activity of disease-causing proteins. This approach is effective for many diseases; nevertheless, many proteins cannot be inhibited by either small molecules or antibodies. Some proteins lack the binding pockets small
	molecules require for interaction. Other proteins are solely intracellular and therefore inaccessible to antibody-based therapeutics which are limited to cell surface and extracellular proteins.

	We believe that our DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules have distinct properties in
	triggering the RNAi pathway to silence disease-related genes, thereby providing advantages for triggering RNA interference compared to other types of double-stranded RNAs used to induce RNAi. Our DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules are structured to be
	optimal for processing by the Dicer enzyme. We believe that other RNAi-inducing molecules currently in development mimic the output of a Dicer enzyme processing event, and thus act at a later point in the RNAi pathway. By contrast, DsiRNA and
	DsiRNA-EX molecules enter the RNAi pathway through being presented to Dicer itself, the pathway&#146;s natural initiation point. By entering the RNAi pathway at that point, we believe that DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules are able to maximize the
	efficacy of the RNAi mechanism, making DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules inherently more potent than traditional RNAi-inducing molecules. This potency advantage derives from the structure of the DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules and how they interact with
	the Dicer enzyme. Specifically, the structure of the DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecule is able to indicate to the Dicer enzyme which of the two RNA strands should be used to guide the selective destruction of disease gene target mRNAs by the RNAi
	machinery. We have found in animal tests that this benefit both increases the potency of our DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules relative to other RNAi-inducing molecules and enables many more sequences to be used to generate our potent DsiRNAs compared
	to other RNAi-inducing molecules. We therefore believe that the nature of the interaction of our DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules with the RNAi pathway intervention facilitates the discovery of new DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX therapeutic candidates and
	further strengthens our intellectual property position.

	potential for chemical modification. Notably, the extensions enable the development of subcutaneously delivered molecules that are conjugated to targeting ligands and possess enhanced biological stability, and that can be administered subcutaneously
	or intravenously without LNPs. These and other favorable features are introduced into the DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules while maintaining high RNAi activity. Due to how the Dicer enzyme processes a DsiRNA or DsiRNA-EX molecule, we can use stable
	covalent non-cleavable linkers for conjugation instead of less stable cleavable linkers that other RNAi molecules may require.

	For therapeutic use in humans, our DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules are optimized both with respect
	to base sequence and chemical modifications to increase stability and mask them from mechanisms that recognize foreign RNAs, inducing immune system stimulation. Our optimization process begins with the screening of 300&nbsp;to 600 RNA sequences
	predicted to have good activity based on a proprietary DsiRNA prediction algorithm. Through optimization and chemical modification we identify the most active RNAi molecules while engineering in enhanced stability and engineering out
	immunostimulatory activity. Our DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules routinely achieve high potencies, with IC50 values (the amount of material required to silence a target gene by 50&nbsp;percent) typically in the 0.1 to 3.0 picomolar range in

	From the initial discovery of the RNAi pathway in mammals through more recent attempts at creating RNAi-based therapeutics, drug delivery has
	been a profound challenge. Most nucleic acids, including our DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules, are unable to enter cells on their own, but cell entry is required to access the RNAi machinery in the cytoplasm and thus to silence the targeted genes. An
	effective drug delivery technology is required to ferry the DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules into cells, through the cell internalization pathway and ultimately release the DsiRNA and DsiRNA-EX molecules into the cell cytoplasm. We believe that our
	drug delivery technologies overcome these challenges. Effective RNAi drug delivery requires the following three steps: Step 1. Accumulation in the target tissue, Step 2. Binding to and internalization by the target tissue cells, Step 3. Release from
	the internalization compartment into the cytoplasm.

	PH1 is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism in the liver that usually results in severe damage to the kidneys. PH1 is
	caused by the failure of the liver to metabolize a precursor of oxalate, a highly insoluble metabolic end-product in humans, resulting in excess oxalate and high levels of oxalate in the urine. This oxalate is formed during the metabolic breakdown
	of hydroxyproline, a naturally occurring component of collagen. In individuals with PH1, crystals of calcium oxalate form in the renal tubules, leading to chronic and painful cases of kidney stones and subsequent fibrosis, known as nephrocalcinosis.
	Despite the typical interventions of a large daily intake of water to dilute the oxalate and other interventions, many patients eventually enter kidney failure (end-stage renal disease, or ESRD) and become eligible for transplant. While in ESRD,
	besides having to endure frequent dialysis, patients are afflicted with a build-up of oxalate in the bone, skin, heart and retina with concomitant debilitating complications, a condition known as systemic oxalosis. Some patients show partial disease
	amelioration with oral pyridoxine supplementation, although disease progression usually continues. Supportive care treatments are available, generally with only minor or no effect on disease progression. Currently, aside from dual liver and kidney
	organ transplantation, there are no highly efficacious therapeutic options for most patients with PH1. Dual liver and kidney transplantation presents a challenge in identifying a donor and is associated with high co-morbidity rates. Even in those
	U.S. patients treated with dual liver and kidney transplant, five-year post-transplant survival is 64 percent. For patients treated with kidney transplant alone, five-year survival is 45 percent.

	While the true prevalence of PH1 is unknown, according to estimates recently published by the New England Journal of Medicine the prevalence
	of PH1 is at least one to three per million of population. Based on the frequency of occurrence of disease mutations in the population derived from genome sequence databases, the estimated genetic incidence is six and half per million of population,
	which we believe suggests that PH1 is under-diagnosed. Roughly consistent with the genetic incidence estimate, the disease is thought to have an incidence of one per 120,000 live births a year in Europe. Certain populations, for example in the
	Canary Islands (Spain) or Kuwait, have higher incidences due to founder effects or consanguinity. We believe approximately 800 patients total are currently in two distinct disease registries in North America and Europe, although these registries do
	not capture all afflicted

	We believe that there is a strong rationale for focusing our RNAi technology on the development of product
	candidates for the treatment of PH1. The hydroxyproline breakdown metabolic pathway that is disrupted in PH1 consists of a number of enzymes. The gene encoding the final enzyme in the pathway, alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 (AGT1), is mutated
	in patients with PH1. Under normal circumstances, AGT1 metabolizes oxalate precursors into the harmless amino acid glycine, which is then used by the body or excreted. But when AGT1 function is disrupted due to mutation, oxalate begins to build up,
	resulting in progressive loss of kidney function and, ultimately, kidney failure. Approximately 50 percent of PH1 patients have kidney failure by age 30 to 35.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Animal studies have shown that intervening one step earlier in the metabolic pathway can reduce or eliminate the abnormally high oxalate
	production caused by the absence of AGT1 enzyme activity. These studies employ mice in which the gene encoding AGT1 has been genetically deleted to create an animal model of PH1. Similar to human patients, these mice have elevated levels of oxalate
	in their urine. When the enzyme one step earlier in the metabolic pathway than AGT1 is eliminated by genetic deletion in this animal model of PH1, oxalate levels in the urine are substantially reduced. These studies demonstrate that genetic deletion
	of the enzyme prior to AGT1 in the pathway prevents the formation of the oxalate precursor and the buildup of oxalate. The enzyme upstream of AGT1 is known as glycolate oxidase (GO) and is encoded by the gene HAO1. In normal animals and humans HAO1
	is expressed exclusively or nearly exclusively in the liver.

	We have demonstrated the efficacy of DCR-PH1 in both

	dosing. At a much later time, 28 and 29 days after dosing, the target gene expression was still significantly reduced by an average of 54% in mice and 68% in monkeys. These data are supportive of an infrequent clinical dosing regimen.

	There is abundant evidence that the MYC

	eliminates elevated MYC activity has the potential to generate therapeutic benefits for patients with various tumor types that include MYC amplifications or other elevations of MYC activity. Inhibition of MYC activity has generated strong anti-tumor
	responses in a variety of animal models of cancer, which we have also observed in our own labs. Genetic techniques in mice which reduce MYC expression or inhibit MYC protein activity have been shown to prevent tumor formation or cause substantial
	tumor shrinkage, depending on the mouse genetic model of cancer employed in the experiment. These results have been obtained from mouse tumor models where MYC is not responsible for tumor initiation. We believe that this animal model data is
	supportive of the use of MYC-targeted therapy to treat cancer in humans.

	The frequently observed mutations in the MYC gene usually result in the duplication or higher-order
	amplification of the MYC oncogene within the tumor cell DNA, resulting in elevated levels of MYC activity. Other types of mutations have also been shown to cause elevated levels of MYC activity, such as chromosomal translocations that result in the
	activation of the MYC oncogene. In addition, human genetic variants known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the MYC gene have been identified that are believed to predispose humans to various cancers. Based on these genetic data in humans, we
	believe that a therapy that reduces or eliminates elevated MYC activity has the potential to generate therapeutic benefits for patients with various tumor types that include MYC amplifications or other elevations of MYC activity.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Recent molecular work demonstrates that MYC over-expression drives the cancer process by selectively amplifying expression of genes typically
	expressed by a cell type. Based on this property, MYC is sometimes described as a &#147;universal amplifier,&#148; which can boost the activity of other cancer-related genes and push a cell to abnormal levels of growth. This model for MYC function
	suggests that an intervention that could bring down the expression of MYC to normal levels could have therapeutic benefit for cancer patients.

	Despite its obvious attractiveness as a therapeutic target, MYC has not been successfully targeted by conventional small molecule drugs and is
	not amenable to antibody therapeutics. Others have attempted to develop small molecules that inhibit MYC but to date these have not been sufficiently potent and specific to be viable product candidates. We believe that the reason for this is likely
	due to the absence of a good binding pocket on the MYC protein. MYC is a member of a protein family known as transcription factors, and these proteins generally lack good binding pockets for small molecules. MYC is not amenable to treatment with
	antibodies; MYC is only found inside the cell and antibodies are limited to extracellular and cell surface targets.

	The &szlig;-catenin/Wnt pathway is consistently activated in human tumors, including ~50% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and ~90% of
	colorectal cancers (CRC).&nbsp;This is often caused directly by tumorigenic mutations in the APC or &szlig;-catenin /CTNNB1 gene. Robust preclinical and genetic evidence strongly suggests that inhibiting &szlig;-catenin function would yield broad
	therapeutic benefit in oncology, but efforts to target it using conventional drug modalities have been unsuccessful to-date.&nbsp;DCR-BCAT, our product that contains DsiRNA-EX targeting human &szlig;-catenin formulated in EnCore lipid nanoparticles
	(LNP) of novel composition, effectively delivered the payload to multiple tumor types including the more clinically relevant CRC liver metastases and caused up to 80% tumor growth inhibition in multiple Wnt/&szlig;-catenin activated colorectal tumor
	models, and near-complete regression in a model of spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, there was no growth inhibition observed when &szlig;-catenin was downregulated in APC/&szlig;-catenin wild type CRC tumors suggests that the
	&szlig;-catenin DsiRNA efficiently and specifically inhibits the Wnt/&szlig;-catenin pathway. In addition, we also found that the dual targeting of Wnt pathway and MEK using DCR-BCAT and an FDA approved Trametinib resulted in robust anti-tumor
	activity compared to either of the single agent treatment in preclinical models of CRC with RAS mutations.

	Globally, HCC is responsible for over 250,000 deaths annually, and is thus the third most common cause of cancer
	death with over 500,000 new cases diagnosed per year. Although surgery is the most effective treatment for HCC, tumor recurrence is very high, and the 5-year survival rate remains at only 10%. Because majority of the patients are diagnosed at
	advanced stage, chemotherapies are frequently ineffective. Targeted therapy, Sorafenib prolonged the overall survival of the HCC patients only by 2-3 months. Thus there is an urgent need for a tolerable, life extending strategies in the management
	of HCC patients. A promising approach will be to define novel targets for therapeutic strategies based on the identification of molecular pathways responsible for initiating and sustaining HCC. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is one such
	signaling mechanism that is frequently activated in this disease and is clearly implicated in tumorigenesis

	With 940,000 recorded cases
	worldwide per year, CRC is the third most common malignancy in the world. Despite efforts to improve early detection and improved therapy, nearly 500,000 patients die from CRC each year worldwide. It has become evident that the main problem in the
	treatment of CRC is not so much eradication of the primary tumor, but rather the formation of incurable metastases. Its high mortality rates are particularly associated with the occurrence of metastases in the liver. Even when metastatic disease
	remains limited to the liver, the majority of these are unresectable and the reported rates of successful resection have been found to be less than 20%, and conventional chemotherapy is only marginally effective.

	confirmed the lack of benefit of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy in patients with KRAS/BRAF mutations, limiting treatment options to standard chemotherapeutics with or
	without VEGF pathway targeted agents. The anti-VEGF therapy is efficacious in mCRCs when combined with chemotherapy, but the overall survival benefit is still very modest. Clinical data also suggest that the VEGF blockade upregulates inflammatory
	pathways and promote metastasis in the face of VEGF blockade. Improving the outcome in CRC will require overcoming the resistance mechanisms that thwart the anti-VEGF therapy. The CRC patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type may be able to derive some
	benefit from anti-EGFR therapy, but it still remains unclear if these patients will definitely respond. MEK inhibitors are being tested in CRC patients too, as MEK is central to the pathogenesis of CRC as a downstream effector of mutant KRAS and
	BRAF, however the single agent efficacy has been very limited to date. All these suggest that targeting resistance pathways through rational combination strategies may lead to greater efficacy. Several studies have identified the aberrant activation
	of Wnt signaling as the primary cause of CRCs and as a resistance mechanism in RAS mutant CRCs. Despite this knowledge, none of the therapeutic agents specifically targeting the Wnt pathway has yet been approved to date. Since Wnt pathway is
	activated in majority of the CRCs (~90%) and HCCs (~50%), we believe that our potent and specific Wnt inhibitor (DCR-BCAT) would reach and treat the liver metastases of CRCs and HCCs effectively. More importantly, we also strongly believe that the
	rational combination of our DCR-BCAT together with MEK inhibitor would be an effective therapeutic strategy for RAS mutant CRC patients with liver metastases.

	scientific knowledge and expertise in RNAi-based therapies provide us with competitive advantages over the various companies and other entities that are attempting to develop similar treatments. However, we face competition at the technology
	platform and therapeutic indication levels from both large and small biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial
	resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and
	retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

	Among these, Alnylam, in

	to complete enrollment in its APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran in ATTR patients with Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy (FAP) in January 2016, Enrollment in its ENDEAVOUR Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of revusiran in ATTR
	patients with Familial Amyloidotic Cardiomyopathy (FAC) continues and data are expected to be reported from this study in 2018. Alnylam is also developing ALN-TTRsc02 for all forms of ATTR amyloidosis and expects to initiate a Phase 1 study in
	mid-2016. Alnylam is also developing RNAi-based therapies for other indications, including PH1, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) hemophilia, porphyria, hypercholesterolemia, hemoglobinopathies, and
	alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency hepatocyte inclusions, among others. In addition, Alnylam expects to initiate a Phase 1 study for ALN-HBV in mid-2016 and announced its intention to seek strategic partnerships for its Hepatic Infectious Disease

	There are limited treatments for HCC in the U.S. and abroad. If diagnosed as early-stage HCC, the disease is generally treated with surgical
	resection of the liver and has the potential to be curative. The majority of patients diagnosed with HCC, however, are in the advanced stages, for which chemotherapies have demonstrated poor efficacy. There is no FDA-approved chemotherapeutic
	regimen. Nexavar is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of advanced or unresectable HCC in our belief. Given the high unmet medical need and the commercial success of Nexavar, numerous targeted therapies for the treatment of hepatocellular

	The current standard of care for treating PH1 is dual-organ transplant, namely a kidney and liver transplant in patients with PH1,
	which is often difficult to perform due to lack of donors and the threat of organ rejection. Other treatments include pyridoxine regimens and intensive dialysis, as well as treatments generally used in kidney stone disorders such as high-volume

	During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with
	the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share
	information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the
	pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of an NDA. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment

	Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the
	chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently
	producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the safety, identity, strength, purity, and quality of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested
	and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is
	manufactured and tested and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations and GCPs.

	The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical
	tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver
	of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than
	accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things,
	whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA typically requires that an NDA include data from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, but approval may be based upon a
	single adequate and well-controlled clinical trial in certain circumstances. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are
	submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what
	conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.

	If a
	product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may
	require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may condition approval on the completion of post approval studies. Such studies may involve clinical trials designed to further
	assess a product&#146;s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. If FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug,
	FDA may also condition approval on the implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution
	methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.

	The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, breakthrough, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or
	simplify the process for reviewing product candidates. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that
	offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. A sponsor can request application of these programs either alone or in combination with each other, depending on the circumstances. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these
	programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. None of the expedited approval programs change the NDA approval

	New drugs are eligible for Fast Track status if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening
	disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track status entitles such a drug to expedited review and frequent contact with the FDA review division. Unlike other expedited
	review programs, Fast Track designation allows FDA to accept for review individual sections of the NDA on a rolling basis. The FDA may also grant a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment
	where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months from filing of an NDA, rather than the standard review of ten months from filing under current PDUFA guidelines. Most products
	that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.

	Drug products

	account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA typically requires that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval conduct
	post-approval clinical trials. As an additional condition of approval, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of all promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

	life-threatening disease or condition for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment
	effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, FDA must take
	actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to the sponsor regarding the
	development of the drug to ensure that the development program is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; and taking steps to ensure that the

	provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new
	chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate
	substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or
	have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing
	exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the
	application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving
	ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a

	In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most product candidates and

	each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons,
	including a finding that the product candidate or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After
	April 2013, the FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. PREA does not apply to any drug for an

	diseases or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health, provides for the grant of a single marketing
	authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an
	application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment reports, each member state must decide whether to recognize the approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the
	disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.

	Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as
	government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has
	become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs,
	including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing
	controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under
	their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.

	The
	Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription
	drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans.
	Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will
	cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used
	by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval.
	However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private
	payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

	The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different
	treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of
	the research and related expenditures will be made to the U.S. Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any,
	the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a
	competitor&#146;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under
	their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.

	In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully
	marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance
	systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability
	of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for
	any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.

	We are a clinical

	We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history, focused on the discovery and
	development of treatments based on the emerging therapeutic modality RNA interference (RNAi), a biological process in which ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules inhibit gene expression. Since our inception in October 2006, we have devoted our resources
	to the development of Dicer substrate RNA (DsiRNA) molecules and delivery technologies. We have had significant operating losses since our inception. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $196.2 million. For the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our net loss was $62.8 million, $47.9 million and $18.5 million, respectively. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research programs and from general and
	administrative costs associated with our operations. Our technologies and product candidates are in early stages of development, and we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on novel
	technologies.

	To date, we have generated revenue primarily from the receipt of upfront research funding, license and option exercise fees
	and preclinical payments under our research collaboration and license agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK). We have not generated, and do not expect to generate, any revenue from product sales for the foreseeable future, and we expect to
	continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the cost of research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for product candidates. The amount of future losses is
	uncertain. Our ability to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on, among other things, us or our existing collaborators, or any future collaborators, successfully developing product candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals to market and
	commercialize product candidates, manufacturing any approved products on commercially reasonable terms, establishing a sales and marketing organization or suitable third party alternatives for any approved product and raising sufficient funds to
	finance business activities. If we or our existing collaborators, or any future collaborators, are unable to develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates or if sales revenue from any product candidate that receives approval is
	insufficient, we will not achieve profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

	If
	we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, reduce or terminate our research and development programs and preclinical studies or clinical trials, if any, limit strategic opportunities or undergo
	reductions in our workforce or other corporate restructuring activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product
	candidates that we would otherwise pursue on our own. We do not expect to realize revenue from product sales, milestone payments or royalties in the foreseeable future, if at all. Our revenue sources are, and will remain, extremely limited unless
	and until our product candidates are clinically tested, approved for commercialization and successfully marketed. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of securities, debt financings, credit and loan facilities and
	payments received under our collaboration and license agreement with KHK. We will be required to seek additional funding in the future and intend to do so through either collaborations, equity offerings or debt financings, credit or loan facilities
	or a combination of one or more of these funding sources. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable
	terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. In addition, as a condition to providing additional
	funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in conducting future business activities, and,

	Relatively few product candidates based on RNAi have been tested in animals or humans, and a
	number of clinical trials conducted by other companies using RNAi technologies have not been successful. We may discover that DsiRNA does not possess certain properties required for a drug to be effective, such as the ability to remain stable in the
	human body for the period of time required for the drug to reach the target tissue or the ability to cross the cell wall and enter into cells within the target tissue for effective delivery. We currently have only limited data, and no conclusive
	evidence, to suggest that we can introduce these necessary drug-like properties into DsiRNA. We may spend substantial funds attempting to introduce these properties and may never succeed in doing so. In addition, product candidates based on DsiRNA
	may demonstrate different chemical and pharmacological properties in patients than they do in laboratory studies. Even if product candidates, such as DCR-PH1 and DCR-MYC, have successful results in animal studies, they may not demonstrate the same
	chemical and pharmacological properties in humans and may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. As a result, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product, we may not become profitable and the

	Further, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has relatively limited experience with RNAi
	and DsiRNA based therapeutics. No regulatory authority has granted approval to any person or entity, including us, to market and commercialize therapeutics using RNAi or DsiRNA, which may increase the complexity, uncertainty and length of the
	regulatory approval process for our product candidates. We and our current collaborators, or any future collaborators, may never receive approval to market and commercialize any product candidate. Even if we or a collaborator obtain regulatory
	approval, the approval may be for disease indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings. We or a collaborator
	may be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or be subject to post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If our technologies based on DsiRNA prove to be ineffective, unsafe or

	With our focus on the emerging therapeutic modality RNAi, these risks may increase to the extent the space becomes more competitive or less
	favored in the commercial marketplace. Additional risks apply in relation to any disease indications we pursue which are classified as rare diseases and allow for orphan drug designation by regulatory agencies in major commercial markets, such as
	the U.S., the European Union and Japan. For instance, we are in the preliminary stages of developing a treatment for the rare genetic disorder Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1) with the gene encoding the liver metabolic enzyme glycolate oxidase as
	our target. Because of the small patient population for a rare disease, if pricing is not approved or accepted in the market at an appropriate level for an approved product with orphan drug designation, such drug may not generate enough revenue to
	offset costs of development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization despite any benefits received from the orphan drug designation, such as market exclusivity, assistance in clinical trial design or a reduction in user fees or tax credits
	related to development expense. Market size is also a variable in disease indications not classified as rare. Our estimates regarding potential market size for any indication may be materially different from what we discover to exist at the time we
	commence commercialization, if any, for a product, which could result in significant changes in our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

	If a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such
	designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for
	seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product candidate as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is
	determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product candidate for the same indication or disease.

	collaboration, we worked together with KHK to optimize KHK&#146;s lipid nanoparticles for tumor delivery and to identify DsiRNAs optimized against oncology and KRAS targets. Based on the results of this research, KHK exercised options to advance two
	separate DsiRNAs into the development stage, including one with a KRAS target. For each product candidate under the research collaboration and license agreement, we have the potential to receive clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestone
	payments of up to $110.0 million and royalties on net sales of such product candidate. The success of our collaboration programs with KHK depends entirely upon the efforts of KHK. Except for certain co-promotion and profit sharing rights we retain
	with respect to the KRAS product candidate if it is approved for marketing and commercialization in the U.S., KHK has sole discretion in determining and directing the efforts and resources, including the ability to discontinue all efforts and
	resources, it applies to the development and, if approval is obtained, commercialization and marketing of the product candidates covered by the collaboration. KHK may not be effective in obtaining approvals for the product candidates developed under
	the collaboration arrangement or in marketing, or arranging for necessary supply, manufacturing or distribution relationships for, any approved products. Under the research collaboration and license agreement, KHK may change its strategic focus or
	pursue alternative technologies in a manner that results in reduced, delayed or no revenue to us. KHK has a variety of marketed products and product candidates under collaboration with other companies, including some of our competitors, and its own
	corporate objectives may not be consistent with our best interests. If KHK fails to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or ultimately commercialize any product candidate under our collaboration or if KHK terminates our collaboration, our

	Competitive therapeutic treatments include those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments that enter the market. We are aware of multiple companies that are working in the field of RNAi

	We also compete with companies working to develop antisense and other RNA-based drugs. Like RNAi therapeutics, antisense drugs target
	messenger RNA (mRNA) with the objective of suppressing the activity of specific genes. The development of antisense drugs is more advanced than that of RNAi therapeutics, and antisense technology may become the preferred technology for products that

	treatments that are either in development or currently marketed. For example, Nexavar, marketed by Amgen Inc. and Bayer AG, is currently in use for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Given the high unmet medical need and the commercial
	success of Nexavar, numerous targeted therapies for the treatment of HCC are under development. Targeted therapies represent the largest proportion of the HCC pipeline. There are also a number of pharmaceuticals and biologics that are marketed or in
	clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors. The most common treatments for solid tumors are various chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy and certain targeted therapies. Targeting therapies include monoclonal antibodies such as
	Avastin, Erbitux and Herceptin, and small molecules, such as Affinitor, Sutent and Tarceva. Immunotherapy regimens are also on the market and in development for the treatment of solid tumors. In addition, we believe that Kadmon Corporation, LLC is

	are subject to continuing regulatory review, including in relation to adverse patient experiences with the product and clinical results that are reported after a product is made commercially available, both in the U.S. and any foreign jurisdiction

	post-market studies or clinical trials to evaluate safety risks related to the use of a product or to require withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA also has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS)
	plan after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug. The EMA now routinely requires risk management plans (RMPs) as part of the marketing authorization application process, and
	such plans must be continually modified and updated throughout the lifetime of the product as new information becomes available. In addition, the relevant governmental authority of any European Union member state can request an RMP whenever there is
	a concern about a risk affecting the benefit risk balance of the product. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make a future product, if any, will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and other regulatory

	Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of
	intellectual property rights, including in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as
	our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. As of March&nbsp;1, 2016, our patent estate, including the
	patents and patent applications that we have licensed from COH, along with one of their affiliates, included over 20 issued patents and over 70 pending patent applications supporting commercial development of our DsiRNA molecules and delivery
	technologies. We may not be able to apply for patents on certain aspects of our product candidates or delivery technologies in a timely fashion or at all. Our existing issued and granted patents and any future patents we obtain may not be
	sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technology or from developing competing products and technology. There is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued or granted patents, that any of our issued
	or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid or unenforceable or that any issued or granted patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover our product candidates or delivery technologies or to provide meaningful
	protection from our competitors. Moreover, the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from
	unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our current and future proprietary technology and product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If third parties disclose or
	misappropriate our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely impact our position in the market.

	The U.S. Patent and Trademark
	Office (USPTO) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in
	abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the
	case. The standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims
	allowable in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. While we will endeavor to try to protect our product candidates with
	intellectual property rights such as patents, as appropriate, the process of obtaining patents is time-consuming, expensive and sometimes unpredictable.

	In addition, there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO which may have a significant
	impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) enacted in 2011 involves significant changes in patent legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled
	on several patent cases in recent years, some of which cases either narrow the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weaken the rights of patent owners in certain situations. The 2013 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in
<I>
	Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.

	precludes a claim to a nucleic acid having a stated nucleotide sequence which is identical to a sequence found in nature and unmodified. We currently are not aware of an immediate
	impact of this decision on our patents or patent applications because we are developing nucleic acid products that are not found in nature. However, this decision has yet to be clearly interpreted by courts and by the USPTO. We cannot assure you
	that the interpretations of this decision or subsequent rulings will not adversely impact our patents or

	of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce

	Research and development of RNAi-based therapeutics and other oligonucleotide-based therapeutics has resulted in
	many patents and patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain patent protection in the field. Our efforts are based on RNAi technology that we have licensed (DsiRNA) and that we have developed internally and own
	(DsiRNA-EX). We have chosen this approach to increase our likelihood of technical success and our freedom to operate. We have obtained grants and issuances of RNAi, RNAi therapeutic and DsiRNA patents and have licensed other patents from third
	parties on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. The issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in key markets around the world that we own or license claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the

	The RNAi-related intellectual property landscape, including patent applications
	in prosecution where no definitive claims have yet issued, is still evolving, and it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate. Other companies are pursuing patent applications and possess issued patents broadly directed to RNAi
	compositions, methods of making and using RNAi and to RNAi-related delivery and modification technologies. Our competitive position may suffer if patents issued to third parties cover our products, or our manufacture or uses relevant to our
	commercialization plans. In such cases, we may not be in a position to commercialize products unless we enter into a license agreement with the intellectual property right holder, if available, on commercially reasonable terms or successfully pursue
	litigation, opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification, derivation action, or cancellation proceeding to limit, nullify or invalidate the third party intellectual property right concerned. Even if
	we are successful in limiting, nullifying, or invalidating third party intellectual property rights through such proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and could require significant time and attention of our personnel.

	While we believe our intellectual property allows us to pursue our current development programs, the biological process of RNAi is a natural
	process and cannot be patented. Several companies in the space are pursuing alternate methods to exploit this phenomenon and have built their intellectual property around these methods. For example, Alnylam controls three patent families containing
	both pending patent applications and issued patents (e.g., U.S. Patent Numbers 8,853,384 and 9,074,213, and European Patent EP 1 352 061 B1) that pertain to RNAi. These are referred to in their corporate literature as the &#147;Tuschl family&#148;
	(e.g. patents and applications claiming priority to WO2002/044321, filed Nov. 29, 2001, and their priority filings) and the &#147;Kreutzer-Limmer family&#148; (e.g. patents and applications claiming priority to WO 2002/044895, filed Jan. 29, 2000,
	WO 2002/055693, filed Jan. 9, 2002, and their priority filings). Both families contain patent applications still in prosecution, with the applicants actively seeking to extend the reach of this intellectual property in ways that might strategically
	impact our business. Additional areas of intellectual property pursued by Alnylam and others include oligonucleotide delivery-related technologies (such as conjugation to targeting moieties) and oligonucleotides directed to specific gene targets.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere are generally published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which
	priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or platform technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally,
	pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our products or the use of our products. Third party intellectual property right
	holders may also bring patent infringement claims against us. No such infringement actions have been brought against us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve any future infringement claims. If we are
	unable to successfully settle future claims on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be prevented from or experience substantial delays in marketing our
	products. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our product candidates that are held to be infringing. We might also be forced to
	redesign product candidates so that we no longer infringe the third party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we
	would otherwise be able to devote to our business.

	jurisdictions. The timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims or if third parties are
	successful in obtaining claims that cover our DsiRNA technology or any of our product candidates. In addition, third parties may attempt to invalidate our intellectual property rights. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could

	We do, and will continue to, rely on intellectual property rights licensed from third parties to protect our technology. We are a party to a
	number of licenses that give us rights to third-party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business. In particular, we have a license from COH (on behalf of itself and IDT) to certain patent rights, which provide platform
	intellectual property for research and development of our DsiRNA molecules employed in our DCR-MYC programs and collaborative programs with KHK. Pursuant to this agreement, we have a worldwide license from COH (subject to the pre-existing
	non-exclusive license) for the exploitation of key intellectual property rights in this respect, and COH and IDT retain ownership of the patents and patent applications to which we are licensed under the agreement. In addition, we have an exclusive
	worldwide license from Arbutus to their LNP technology for delivery of certain therapeutics to treat PH1, and Arbutus retains ownership of its patents. This technology could be important to us as we are seeking to use it to deliver DCR-PH1 to the
	liver. If we are unable to do so, our DCR-PH1 program would suffer delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We also may license additional third-party intellectual
	property in the future. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights.
	Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications licensed to us. Even if patents issue or are granted, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are
	infringing these patents, or may pursue litigation less aggressively than we would. Further, we may not obtain exclusive rights, which would allow for third parties to develop competing products. Without protection for, or exclusive right to, the
	intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. In addition, we sublicense our rights
	under our third-party licenses to KHK and may sublicense such rights to current or future collaborators or any future strategic partners. Any impairment of these sublicensed rights could result in reduced revenue under our collaboration agreement
	with KHK or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our collaborators or any future strategic partners.

	offer for sale and sell products covered by the licensed patent rights for the treatment or prevention of disease in humans (excluding viruses and delivery of products into the eye or ear). While we believe that such non-exclusive license has been
	terminated, COH has informed us that a sublicensee to that non-exclusive license was permitted to enter into an equivalent non-exclusive license which, to our knowledge, is subsisting with Arrowhead, as successor to the non-exclusive license holder.
	As successor to the non-exclusive license holder, we believe that Arrowhead has substantially similar access to the same patent rights related to DsiRNA technology granted to us under our license with COH. Arrowhead is developing RNA-based
	therapeutics for the treatment of diseases of the liver, which may directly compete with our product candidates. In addition, the U.S. government has certain rights to the inventions covered by the patent rights and COH, as an academic research and
	medical center, has the right to practice the licensed patent rights for educational, research and clinical uses. If Arrowhead or another party develops, manufactures, markets and sells any product covered by the same patent rights and technologies
	that compete with ours, it could significantly undercut the value of any of our product candidates, which would materially adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.

	Obtaining a valid and enforceable issued or granted patent covering our technology in the U.S. and worldwide can be extremely costly. In
	jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection, competitors may use our technology to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where it is more
	difficult to enforce a patent as compared to the U.S. Competitor products may compete with our future products in jurisdictions where we do not have issued or granted patents or where our issued or granted patent claims or other intellectual
	property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitor activities in these jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, make it difficult to enforce patents and such countries may not recognize
	other types of intellectual property protection, particularly that relating to biopharmaceuticals. This could make it difficult for us to prevent the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary

	If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent
	covering one of our products or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds
	for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected
	with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable.
	With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity
	or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our
	business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.

	The regulations
	that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins
	after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. Although we intend to monitor these
	regulations, our programs are currently in the early stages of development and we will not be able to assess the impact of price regulations for a number of years. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular
	country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these
	products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. However, there may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for newly-approved drugs. Moreover,
	eligibility for coverage does not necessarily signify that a drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution costs. Also, interim payments for new drugs, if
	applicable, may be insufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Thus, even if we succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any
	products may be insufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Because our programs are in the early stages of development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost effectiveness or the likely level or method of
	reimbursement. Increasingly, the third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are seeking greater upfront discounts, additional rebates and other concessions to reduce the prices
	for pharmaceutical products. If the price we are able to charge for any products we develop, or the reimbursement provided for such products, is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our return on investment could be adversely
	affected.

	filing of false or improper claims for payment by federal healthcare programs (e.g. the False Claims Act), prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable by federal healthcare programs (e.g. the Anti-Kickback Statute), and

	various federal programs were scheduled to take place, beginning in January 2013, although the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 delayed the BCA&#146;s automatic cuts until March&nbsp;1, 2013. While the Medicare program&#146;s eligibility and
	scope of benefits are generally exempt from these cuts, Medicare payments to providers and Part D health plans are not exempt. The BCA did, however, provide that the Medicare cuts to providers and Part D health plans would not exceed two percent.
	President Obama issued the sequestration order on March&nbsp;1, 2013, and cuts went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013. Additionally, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 extended sequestration for Medicare for another two years, through 2023, and a

	The situation with the
	federal budget remains in flux. From October&nbsp;1, 2013 through October&nbsp;16, 2013, the U.S. federal government ceased the majority of its operations after Congress failed to enact legislation appropriating funds for fiscal year 2014. On
	October&nbsp;17, 2013, President Obama signed into law the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014, which included a continuing resolution to fund the government until January&nbsp;15, 2014 and suspended the statutory debt ceiling until
	February&nbsp;7, 2014. After extending the government funding expiration date to January&nbsp;18, 2014, Congress passed a $1.1 trillion spending bill that was signed into law on January&nbsp;17, 2014 and funds the government through
	September&nbsp;30, 2014. While on December&nbsp;9, 2014, Congress passed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, which funds the government through September&nbsp;30, 2015, this new law is a temporary measure that does
	not resolve the debt-limit issue. Many Members of Congress have made public statements indicating that some or all of these budget-related deadlines should be used as leverage to negotiate additional cuts in federal spending. The Medicare program is
	frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts. The full impact on our business of any future cuts in Medicare or other programs would be uncertain. If federal spending is reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of
	relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of
	relevant agencies to timely review and approve drug research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.

	As a public company we incur, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging
	growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ
	and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and
	other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For
	example, we expect that these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our
	board of directors. However, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided
	by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.

	over financial reporting. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To
	achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404(b) within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to
	continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as
	appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be
	able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section&nbsp;404(b). If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction

	On June&nbsp;10, 2015, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alnylam) filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of Middlesex
	Country, Massachusetts. The complaint alleges misappropriation of confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information, as well as other related claims, in connection with the Company&#146;s hiring of a number of former employees of
	Merck&nbsp;&amp; Co., Inc. (Merck) and its discussions with Merck regarding the acquisition of its subsidiary, Sirna Therapeutics, Inc. (Sirna), which was subsequently acquired by Alnylam. The complaint seeks among other things, damages,
	attorneys&#146; fees, and an order permanently enjoining the Company from disclosing or using any of Alnylam&#146;s confidential information or trade secrets. An unfavorable resolution of this matter could potentially cause us to incur significant
	legal fees and other costs to defend this action, and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or prospects, potentially delay or limit our ability to use some of our research
	and development programs, and potentially result in paying monetary damages. We believe, however, that Alnylam&#146;s allegations lack merit, we have filed an answer denying all liability, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend all claims
	asserted. We expect that a liability is not probable. Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate any range of potential future charges, and we have not recorded any accrual for a contingent liability associated with this legal proceeding.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are
	an RNA interference-based biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative treatments for rare inherited diseases involving the liver, for other therapeutic areas in which the liver plays a key role, and for cancers
	that are genetically defined. We are using our RNA interference (RNAi) technology platform to build a broad pipeline in these therapeutic areas. In many cases, we are pursuing targets that have historically been difficult to inhibit using
	conventional approaches, but where we believe connections between targets and diseases are well understood and documented. We aim to discover, develop and commercialize these novel therapeutics either on our own or in collaboration with
	pharmaceutical partners, while seeking to retain significant portions of the commercial rights in the rare disease and oncology fields.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the rare disease field, we are developing a proprietary treatment, DCR-PH1, for the rare and serious inherited disorder Primary
	Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1). In December 2015, we initiated dosing in our first PH1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers, and we expect to begin our first Phase 1 study of DCR-PH1 in patients with PH1 in the first half of 2016. In December
	2015, we also initiated an international, multicenter, observational study designed to measure biomarkers implicated in PH1, and enrolled our first patient in this observational study in January 2016. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
	have both granted Orphan Drug Designation to DCR-PH1. We also have discovery and early development programs against a series of additional rare inherited diseases involving the liver where we are utilizing our DsiRNA-EX Conjugate technology. In
	other therapeutic areas involving the liver, we are using our DsiRNA-EX Conjugate technology to develop potential therapeutics for a wide variety of diseases, including chronic liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and viral infection diseases.
	We have selected these diseases and disease target genes based on criteria that include having a strong therapeutic hypothesis, a readily-identified patient population, the availability of predictive biomarkers, and favorable competitive
	positioning. For many of these diseases we may seek development partners. In oncology, we are currently directing our development efforts towards our proprietary product candidate DCR-MYC for the treatment of MYC-related cancers, including
	hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the second quarter of 2014, we initiated a multi-center, dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical study of DCR-MYC to assess the safety and tolerability of DCR-MYC in patients with solid tumors, multiple myeloma, or
	lymphoma who are refractory or unresponsive to standard therapies. In the fourth quarter of 2014 we initiated a global Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of DCR-MYC in patients with advanced HCC with the first patient dosed in January 2015. In the second
	quarter of 2015, we announced plans to expand our ongoing Phase 1 study of DCR-MYC in solid tumors, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma to include a cohort of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) following early signs of clinical and
	metabolic response and tumor shrinkage in PNET patients. In addition, once the optimal dose of DCR-MYC has been determined, we plan to initiate enrollment of a cohort of patients who will undergo pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies. Molecular
	analysis of the MYC gene transcript in these biopsies will allow direct observation of the RNAi-mechanism of action of DCR-MYC. We expect to announce data from the PNET and biopsy cohorts in 2016.

	As part of our collaboration with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (KHK), a global pharmaceutical company, we are developing a product candidate

	development expenses. For the KRAS product candidate, we retain an option to co-promote in the U.S. for an equal share of the profits from U.S. net sales. We are also developing, with KHK, a therapeutic candidate targeting a second cancer-related
	gene, which we are not identifying at this time. For each product candidate in our collaboration with KHK, we have the potential to receive clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments of up to $110.0&nbsp;million and royalties on

	Since our inception in October
	2006, we have devoted substantial resources to the research and development of DsiRNA molecules and drug delivery technologies and the protection and enhancement of our intellectual property estate. We have no products approved for sale and all of
	our revenue to date has been collaboration revenue or government grant revenue. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, private placements of preferred stock and convertible debt securities,
	from research funding, license fees, option exercise fees, preclinical payments under our research collaboration and license agreement with KHK, from government grants, and from a secured term loan from Hercules Technology II, L.P. (Hercules loan).
	More particularly, since our inception and through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have raised an aggregate of $278.8 million to fund our operations, of which approximately $45.4 million was from the May 2015 follow-on offering of common stock, $0.2
	million was from a federal government grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) covering our work on cancer treatment research, $92.7 million was from the initial public offering of our common stock, which closed on February&nbsp;4, 2014,
	$110.5 million was from the sale of preferred stock and convertible debt securities (including $3.0 million from the 2013 bridge note financing), $17.5 million was through our collaboration and license agreement with KHK, $0.5 million was from a
	federal government grant for our Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project in November 2010 and $12.0 million was from borrowings under the Hercules loan. On April&nbsp;7, 2014, we repaid the remaining amount of the Hercules loan of approximately
	$3.6 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents and held-to-maturity investments of $94.6 million and we also had $1.1 million in assets held in restriction.

	On February&nbsp;4, 2014, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock, in which we issued and sold a total of 6,900,000
	shares of common stock, including 900,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of an option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $15.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $92.7
	million after deducting the underwriting commissions and discounts and offering expenses payable by us. All of the shares of our preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock and our warrants to purchase preferred stock became
	exercisable to purchase common stock immediately prior to the completion of our initial public offering.

	research and clinical programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We recognized $0.2 million in revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and no revenue for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and
	2013. Our revenue to date has been generated through our research collaboration and license agreement with KHK and government grants. We have not generated any commercial product revenue. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit
	of $196.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase

	Pursuant
	to the terms of the agreement, we paid COH a one-time, non-refundable license fee and issued shares of our common stock to COH and a co-inventor of the core DsiRNA patent. COH is entitled to receive milestone payments in an aggregate amount within
	the range of $5.0 million to $10.0 million upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. COH is further entitled to receive royalties at a low single-digit percentage of any net sale revenue of the licensed products sold by us and
	our sublicensees. If we sublicense the licensed patent rights to a third party, COH has the right to receive a double digit percentage of sublicense income, the percentage of which decreases after we have expended $12.5 million in development and
	commercialization costs. We are also obligated to pay COH an annual license maintenance fee, which may be credited against any royalties due to COH in the same year, and reimburse COH for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of
	the license patent rights. The license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents or copyrights licensed under the agreement. We have not included our obligations to make future milestone payments on

	In the second quarter of 2014, we initiated a multi-center,
	dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical study of DCR-MYC to assess the safety and tolerability of DCR-MYC in patients with solid tumors, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma who are refractory or unresponsive to standard therapies, and in the fourth quarter of
	2014 we initiated a global phase 1b/2 clinical trial of DCR-MYC in patients with advanced HCC with the first patient dosed in January 2015. In the second quarter of 2015, we announced an expansion of our DCR-MYC ongoing Phase 1 trial to include a
	cohort of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) following early signs of clinical and metabolic response and tumor shrinkage in PNET patients. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DCR-MYC has been determined, we plan to initiate

	we initiated dosing in our first PH1 clinical trial, which is a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) trial in normal healthy volunteers and is being conducted in the U.S. Data from the healthy volunteer study will be used to facilitate initiation of clinical

	For the stock options granted by us on December&nbsp;4, 2013 and December&nbsp;30, 2013, our board of directors determined that the fair value
	of common stock of $3.42 per share calculated in the contemporaneous valuation as of August&nbsp;31, 2013 reasonably reflected the per share fair value of our common stock on each of the grant dates. However, in the context and given the anticipated
	proximity of our initial public offering, for financial reporting purposes, in early January 2014 we conducted a retrospective valuation as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, which reasonably assumed that examination of contemporaneous information would
	have concluded a price range consistent with the then estimated price range for our initial public offering of $11.00 to $13.00 per share. The retrospective valuation as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 indicated that the fair value of our common stock on
	December&nbsp;31, 2013 was $7.42 per share. The valuation concluded that, with such contemporaneous information, the fair value of our common stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 was $7.42 per share primarily due to feedback from investment bankers
	that we had an increased probability of executing a successful initial public offering in the first quarter of 2014 and feedback from investment bankers that public investors could potentially price our common stock in the range of $11.00 to $13.00
	per share in such an initial public offering. Accordingly, we recognized a stock-based compensation charge of less than $0.1 million in relation to the December&nbsp;4, 2013 and December&nbsp;30, 2013 option grants for the quarter ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2013 based on the grant date fair value of our common stock as determined by the retrospective valuation.

	was originally pronounced to become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the ASU by one year. As a result, the Company will
	be required to apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and would be permitted to adopt the ASU early, but not before the original public organization effective date (annual periods beginning

	Research and development expenses were $44.0 million and $29.5 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
	2015 and 2014, respectively. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, direct research and development expenses were $15.5 million compared to $11.1 million in the prior year. The increase of $4.4&nbsp;million was the result of increased costs
	related to pre-clinical and clinical start-up activities for DCR-PH1, as well as increased costs related to DCR-MYC manufacturing for clinical development and our clinical trials, including our global Phase 1b/2 trial in patients with advanced HCC,
	which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2014, offset by a reduction in license fees paid to a collaboration partner. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, platform-related expenses were $14.1 million compared to $10.0 million in the prior
	year. The increase of $4.1&nbsp;million was primarily due to increased expenses related to discovery and early development of future programs, offset by a decrease to non-employee stock-based compensation of $1.5 million. Employee-related expenses
	were $11.3 million in 2015 compared to $7.7 million in the prior year. The increase of $3.6 million was primarily due to additional headcount, along with an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.6 million. Facilities, depreciation and other
	expenses have increased by $2.3 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 due to increased occupancy costs. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in 2016 as we continue spending on our development programs
	and clinical trials.

	General and administrative expenses were $19.2 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
	increase of $3.6 million was primarily due to an increase in payroll-related expenses of $0.7 million, an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.5 million, and an increase in professional fees of $1.9 million, primarily from legal costs incurred
	related to the Alnylam complaint. We expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in 2016 as we incur additional costs to support the expanding operations.

	million, and a decrease in interest expense of $0.3 million due to the Hercules loan being repaid in full in April 2014.

	Research and development expenses were $29.5 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
	2014 and 2013, respectively. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, direct research and development expenses increased by $6.9 million compared to the prior year as a result of the initiation of the clinical trials related to DCR-MYC and an
	increase in research activities related to DCR-PH1, of which $3.0&nbsp;million related to license fees paid to Arbutus for the LNP delivery of DCR-PH1. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, platform-related expenses increased by $6.5 million
	compared to the prior year primarily due to increased expenses related to discovery and early development of future programs, along with an increase in non-employee stock-based compensation of $1.7 million. Employee-related expenses increased by
	$4.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to additional hiring during the period, along with an increase in stock-based compensation of $2.4 million. Facilities, depreciation and other
	expenses have decreased by $0.3 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 due to a reduction in occupancy costs. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in the future as we continue spending on our development
	programs and clinical trials.

	General and administrative expenses were $15.6 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The
	increase of $9.8 million, or 169 percent, was primarily due to an increase in payroll-related expenses of $3.6 million, which includes an increase in stock-based compensation of $2.6 million, an increase in professional fees of $2.9 million and an
	increase in non-employee stock-based compensation of $1.1 million. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses during 2014 was primarily due to the transition and increased costs associated with operating as a public company. We
	expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future as we expand our operating activities and incur additional costs associated with being a publicly-traded company. These increases will likely include legal,
	accounting and filing fees, directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance premiums and fees associated with investor relations.

	Other expense was $2.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase of
	$1.7 million, or 149 percent, was primarily due to the re-measurement of the preferred stock warrant liability of $2.7 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest and other expenses of $1.0 million. The decrease in interest expense
	was due to the Hercules loan being repaid in full in April 2014.

	Since our inception and through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have raised an aggregate of $278.8 million to fund our operations, of which
	approximately $45.4 million was from the May 2015 follow-on offering of common stock, $0.2 million was from a federal government grant from the NIH covering our work on cancer treatment research, $92.7 million was from the initial public offering of

	and license agreement with KHK, $0.5 million was from a federal government grant for our Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project in November 2010 and $12.0 million was from borrowings under the Hercules loan. On April&nbsp;7, 2014, we repaid the
	remaining amount of the Hercules loan of approximately $3.6 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents and held-to-maturity investments of $94.6 million and $1.1 million in assets held in restriction.

	We granted to Hercules a security interest in

	exercise price of $25.00 per share. The warrants became exercisable to purchase our common stock immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering. On February&nbsp;11, 2014, Hercules net exercised these warrants in exchange for a

	The
	primary objectives of our investment activities are to ensure liquidity and to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our marketable securities without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities
	that we invest in may have market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents and held-to-maturity investments of $94.6 million. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate
	sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Due to the short-term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents and held-to-maturity investments and the low risk profile of our investments an immediate
	100&nbsp;basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents and held-to-maturity investments. To minimize the risk in the future, we intend to maintain our portfolio of
	cash and cash equivalents and held-to-maturity investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, government and non-government debt securities and corporate obligations.

	We have
	audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable convertible
	preferred stock and stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to
	express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
	Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor
	were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
	evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
	our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
	the financial position of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in
	conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company generates revenue from research collaboration and license agreements with third parties which contain multiple deliverables. The deliverables in
	the agreements include (a)&nbsp;the use of the Company&#146;s technology and (b)&nbsp;research and development of product candidates. Such agreements may provide for consideration to the Company in the form of up-front payments, research and
	development services, milestone payments and royalties. Revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met: (1)&nbsp;pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)&nbsp;delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and risk of
	loss has passed; (3)&nbsp;the seller&#146;s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (4)&nbsp;collectability is reasonably assured. Multiple-deliverable arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or
	whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. When deliverables are separable, consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the appropriate revenue
	recognition principles are applied to each unit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the inception of each arrangement that includes payments for optional research or milestones, the
	Company evaluates whether each option or milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the option or milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (1)&nbsp;the consideration is
	commensurate with either the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s); (2)&nbsp;as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the
	milestone; (3)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance; and (4)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement.&nbsp;Substantive options and milestones are
	recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	When the Company determines that an
	arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, it must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. The Company&#146;s revenue to date results from a research
	collaboration and license agreement entered into in December 2009 and an NIH grant awarded in 2015. Non-refundable up-front license fees under the agreement were initially recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and are being recognized as revenue
	over the Company&#146;s performance period as defined in the agreement. Research and development service revenue is recognized over the research term as the research and development services are provided. The cost of such services is reflected in

	The Company accounts for stock options granted as share-based awards at fair value, which is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair
	value measurement date for employee awards is the date of grant. The fair value measurement date for nonemployee awards is generally the date the performance of services is completed. Share-based compensation costs are recognized as expense over the
	requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis for all time-vested awards.

	For performance-based stock awards,

	In
	May&nbsp;2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
	Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and creates a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance was originally pronounced to become effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15,
	2016, with early adoption not permitted. On July&nbsp;9, 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the ASU by one year. As a result, the Company will be required to apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning
	after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and would be permitted to adopt the ASU early, but not before the original public organization effective date (annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016). Two adoption methods are permitted: retrospectively
	to all prior reporting periods presented, with certain practical expedients permitted; or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially adopting the ASU recognized at the date of initial application. The Company has not yet determined
	which adoption method it will utilize or the effect, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements through December&nbsp;31, 2015 as the Company has yet to record revenue from contracts with customers.

	On March&nbsp;26, 2009, as amended in June 2011, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with an independent finance company,
	Hercules Technology II, LP (Hercules), for up to $7.0 million. The Hercules loan, which has since been repaid, was collateralized by a security interest in all tangible assets. The applicable annual interest rate was 10.15% from December&nbsp;31,
	2013 through April&nbsp;7, 2014, the date the Company repaid the remaining amount of the Hercules loan in full for a total amount of $3.6 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	connection with the Hercules loan, the Company issued warrants to Hercules for the purchase of an aggregate of 21,000 shares of the Series A preferred stock and 26,400 shares of the Series B preferred stock each at an exercise price of $25.00 per
	share. Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO on February&nbsp;4, 2014, all of the outstanding shares of the Series A, Series B and Series C preferred stock were automatically converted into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. The
	fair value of the warrants was classified as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2013. After the conversion of Series A and Series B preferred stock, the fair value of the warrants was reclassified as a
	part of stockholders&#146; equity. The re-measurement of the liability continued until the date of the closing of the IPO. The fair value of the outstanding Hercules warrants as of the IPO closing date was $0.8 million and was determined using the
	Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

	9. Bridge Loan Financing

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On June&nbsp;26, 2013, the Company issued convertible notes and warrants for the purchase of preferred stock in the next qualified financing
	to then existing preferred and common stockholders for approximately $3.0 million (bridge loan financing). The notes were due to mature on June&nbsp;26, 2018, unless previously converted or repaid. In the event the Company were to obtain financing
	through the issuance of equity securities, including an IPO, prior to the maturity date, the notes would automatically convert into shares of the equity issued in such a qualified financing and at the lowest price per share of the equity securities
	issued and sold in that financing. If a liquidation event were to occur prior to June&nbsp;26, 2018, the notes could be converted at the option of the holder for an amount equal to two times the outstanding principal balance of the notes in cash or
	the issuance of Series B preferred stock equal to the outstanding principal balance of the notes divided by 0.9. The notes had an interest rate of 7%&nbsp;per year, payable at the earlier of the notes&#146; conversion or maturity.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The purpose of this bridge loan financing was to provide operating cash to the Company until it completed the issuance of the Series&nbsp;C in July 2013, at
	which time the notes were converted into 428,526 shares of Series&nbsp;C preferred shares at $7.00 per share and the related accrued interest of $20 became payable.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the issuance of the bridge loan financing, the Company issued warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 85,703&nbsp;shares of the
	Company&#146;s preferred stock in the next qualified financing at an exercise price of $7.00 per share. The warrants are immediately exercisable and expire 5&nbsp;years from the date of issuance. The Company estimated the fair value of the warrants
	at the date of issuance to be $0.3 million. The fair value of the warrants was recorded as a discount to the convertible notes upon issuance, and was initially classified as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The issuance
	date fair value was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of approximately 1.2%, expected life of 5&nbsp;years, volatility of 64%, and no expected dividends. After the
	conversion of Series C preferred stock, the fair value of the warrants related to Series C preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the IPO was reclassified as a part of stockholders&#146; equity (deficit). The re-measurement
	of the Series C preferred stock warrant liability continued until the closing date of the IPO.

	The estimated fair value of the outstanding Series C

	The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
	option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility for the Company&#146;s common stock was determined based on an average of the historical volatility of a peer group of similar companies. The Company has
	limited stock option exercise information, as such; the expected term of stock options granted was calculated using the simplified method, which represents the average of the contractual term of the stock option and the weighted-average vesting
	period of the stock option. The assumed dividend yield is based upon the Company&#146;s expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the stock option is based upon the U.S.
	Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
	orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Valuation techniques used to
	measure fair value are performed in a manner to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. As a basis for considering such assumption the accounting literature establishes a three-tier value hierarchy which
	prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level&nbsp;1) observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level&nbsp;2) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or
	indirectly; and (Level&nbsp;3) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions.

	Management of the Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its net deferred
	tax assets and determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has a valuation allowance at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. The valuation allowance
	increased in 2014 and decreased in 2015 by $18.7 million and $1.4 million, primarily due to the increase in the Company&#146;s net operating loss carryforwards, capitalized costs and stock compensation for 2014 and a decrease in 2015 as a result of
	prior year losses utilized to offset an intercompany gain. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has approximately $92.5 million of federal and $77.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, and $2.1 million of federal and $1.4 million
	of Massachusetts tax credits that expire starting in 2028.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on many factors, including the
	Company&#146;s ability to generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward period. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, certain substantial changes in the Company&#146;s ownership, including a sale of the Company or
	significant changes in ownership due to sales of equity, may have limited, or may limit in the future, the amount of net operating loss carryforwards, which could be used annually to offset future taxable income.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had $1.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $1.4 million would affect income tax expense if recognized,
	before consideration of the Company&#146;s valuation allowance. The Company does not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties associated with uncertain
	tax positions as a component of income tax expense. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has not accrued any penalties or made provisions for interest.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On June&nbsp;10, 2015, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alnylam) filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of Middlesex
	County, Massachusetts. The complaint alleges misappropriation of confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information, as well as other related claims, in connection with the Company&#146;s hiring of a number of former employees of
	Merck&nbsp;&amp; Co., Inc. (Merck) and its discussions with Merck regarding the acquisition of its subsidiary, Sirna Therapeutics, Inc. (Sirna), which was subsequently acquired by Alnylam. The complaint seeks among other things, unspecified damages,
	attorneys&#146; fees, and an order permanently enjoining the Company from disclosing or using any of Alnylam&#146;s confidential information or trade secrets.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company believes that these allegations lack merit, has filed an answer denying all liability and intends to continue to vigorously defend all claims
	asserted. At this time, the Company has not recorded a liability in connection with these matters because it believes that any potential loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	From time to time, the Company may be subject to various claims and legal proceedings. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal
	proceeding is considered probable and the amount is reasonably estimable, the Company will accrue a liability for the estimated loss. There were no litigation liabilities outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	We continuously seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls. This

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
	or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are
	met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations
	include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
	people or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
	stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
	cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
