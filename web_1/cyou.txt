	Our business and the industry in which we operate are evolving rapidly. We were incorporated on August&nbsp;6, 2007 in the
	Cayman Islands and began our online game business as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sohu.com Inc. In 2007 Sohu transferred all of its PC game business to us. In 2011 we acquired 7Road and began generating Web game revenues. In 2012, we began
	to develop and operate mobile games, but did not begin to generate any significant revenues from mobile games until late in 2014 when we launched TLBB 3D. In August 2015, as revenues from our Web games, Wartune and DDTank, had begun to decline, we
	sold 7Road&#146;s operating company Shenzhen 7Road Technology Co., Ltd., or Shenzhen 7Road, and as a result we have no remaining significant Web games in operation. In 2011, we began to expand into the platform channel business with our acquisition
	of the 17173.com Website, which operates our online advertising business, from Sohu and acquired the entities operating our cinema advertising business. In December 2013, we acquired RaidCall, which operates free social communication software; and
	in July 2014 we acquired a majority interest in MoboTap, which operates the Dolphin Browser. However, our acquisitions of RaidCall and MoboTap were not successful, as expected synergies did not materialize. Our revenues from platform channel
	services other than from online advertising on the 17173.com Website have been relatively insignificant.

	Our past successes in our online games business with PC games may not provide a meaningful basis

	In response to such rapid migration, we have devoted and we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of our

	certain that we will be successful in our efforts to continue to expand into mobile games. Despite the success of our mobile game TLBB 3D, the popularity of, and the revenues generated from, the game declined through 2015, and we have not been able

	Our revenues grew significantly in a relatively short period of time prior to 2014, but our revenue growth stalled in 2014 and 2015. Primarily

	million and to $761.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015. Our net income attributable to Changyou.com Limited decreased from $282.4 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 to $268.6 million for the
	year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we suffered a net loss attributable to Changyou.com Limited of $3.4 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and sustained operating losses for each quarter of 2014. Although our net income attributable to

	as a result of a reduction in our workforce, we are not likely to experience rates of revenue growth in the future similar to those that we experienced prior to 2014. We also may experience declines in our revenues or net losses in the future due to

	We have made acquisitions of, and may potentially acquire in the future, technologies, businesses or assets that are complementary to our
	business and/or enter into strategic alliances in order to leverage our position in the Chinese online game market and expand our business domestically and internationally. Such acquisitions or strategic alliances may expose us to potential risks,
	including risks associated with the integration of new technologies, businesses and personnel including our continued reliance on the management teams of the acquisition targets to operate the acquired businesses, unforeseen or hidden liabilities,
	the diversion of management attention and resources from our existing business, and the inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions or strategic alliances. Any difficulties encountered in the
	acquisition and strategic alliance process may have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. In addition, acquired businesses may not perform to our expectations for various reasons, including the loss of key personnel or key
	clients, and our strategic focus may change. As a result, we may not realize the benefits we anticipated. If we fail to integrate acquired technologies, businesses and assets or realize the expected benefits, we may not receive a return on our
	investment and our transaction costs for such acquisitions. The benefits of an acquisition or investment may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition or investment will produce the intended
	benefits, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Acquisitions could result in contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill and/or intangible assets, which could
	adversely affect our results of operations. For example, in December 2013, we acquired RaidCall with the expectation of generating benefits from synergies with our online game business; in November 2013 we acquired Beijing Doyo Internet Technology
	Co., Ltd., or Doyo, with the expectation of generating benefits from synergies with our online advertising business, and in July 2014 we acquired MoboTap, which operates the Dolphin Browser, with the expectation of generating benefits from synergies
	with our platform channel business. In 2014 we recognized a $33.8 million impairment loss for goodwill and a $15.3 million impairment loss for acquired intangible assets related to RaidCall, in 2015 we recognized a $29.6 million impairment loss for
	goodwill and an $8.9 million impairment loss for acquired intangible assets relating to the Dolphin Browser, and in 2015 we sold Doyo and recognized a $1.9 million impairment loss for goodwill, as a result of our management&#146;s conclusion that
	the expected synergies would not materialize.

	works from other online game companies that also adapt their online games from popular Chinese works. For example, under our existing license agreements with Louis Cha, a famous author of Chinese martial arts novels, we have the exclusive right to
	adapt certain of his novels into online games, such as TLBB and our mobile game TLBB 3D, and to operate the games in the China market. We also have a non-exclusive license to operate, and to sublicense the right to operate, such games outside of

	of those revenues depends on such factors as whether the virtual items purchased by game players are considered consumable or perpetual. We rely on our data systems to record and monitor the purchase and consumption of virtual items by our game
	players and the types of virtual items purchased. If our data systems fail to accurately record the purchase and consumption information of the virtual items, we may not be able to accurately recognize our revenues. In addition, various factors
	affect the estimated lives of perpetual virtual items, such as the average period that game players typically play our games and other game player behavior patterns, the acceptance and popularity of expansion packs, promotional events launched and
	market conditions, and we rely on our billing systems to capture such historical game player behavior patterns and other information. If such information is not accurately recorded, or if we do not have sufficient information due to the short
	operating history of any of our games, we will not be able to accurately estimate the lives of, or the estimated average period the game players play our games with respect to, the perpetual virtual items, which will also affect our ability to
	accurately recognize our revenues from such perpetual virtual items. If our data systems were damaged by system failure, network interruption, or virus infection, or attacked by a hacker, the integrity of data would be compromised, which could
	adversely affect our revenue recognition and the completeness and accuracy of our recognized revenues.

	Currently, we sell a substantial portion of our virtual game points and prepaid game cards to our game players through third-party online
	payment platforms. In these online transactions, secure transmission of confidential information, such as customers&#146; credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information and billing addresses, over public networks is essential if we
	are to maintain our consumers&#146; confidence in us. In addition, we expect that an increasing amount of our sales will be conducted over the Internet as a result of the growing use of online payment systems. As a result, the risk of associated
	online crime will increase. Our current security measures and those of the third-party online payment platforms with whom we transact business may not be adequate. We must be prepared to increase our security measures and efforts so that our game
	players have confidence in the reliability of the online payment systems that we use, which will require us to incur additional expense. Such increased security measures may still not make our online payment systems completely safe. In addition, we

	information, and could harm our reputation, ability to attract customers and ability to encourage customers to purchase virtual items.

	All of our games, including PC games, mobile games and Web games, are operated under the
	item-based revenue model. Under this revenue model, our game players are able to play the games for free if they so choose, but are charged for the purchase of virtual items in the games. We currently expect that all of our game revenues, including
	revenues from any future games, will continue to be generated under the item-based revenue model. The item-based revenue model requires us to design games that not only attract game players to spend more time playing, but also encourage them to
	purchase virtual items. The sale of virtual items requires us to track closely consumer tastes and preferences, especially as to in-game consumption patterns. If we fail to design and price virtual items so as to incentivize game players to purchase
	them, we may not be able to effectively translate our game player base and their playing time into revenues. In addition, the item-based revenue model may cause additional concerns with PRC regulators who have been implementing regulations designed
	to reduce the amount of time that Chinese youths spend on online games and intended to limit the total amount of virtual currency issued by online game operators and the amount purchased by individual game players. A revenue model that does not
	charge for time played may be viewed by the PRC regulators as inconsistent with these goals. The item-based revenue model may not continue to be commercially successful and in the future we may need to change our revenue model to a time-based or
	other revenue model. Any change in revenue model could result in disruption of our game operations, a decrease in the number of our game players and a decline in our revenues.

	In addition, as all of these contractual
	arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through either arbitration or litigation in the PRC, they would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal
	procedures. We would have to rely for enforcement on legal remedies under PRC law, including specific performance, injunctive relief or damages, which might not be effective. For example, if we sought to enforce the equity interest purchase right
	agreements for the transfer of equity interests in any of our principal VIEs, if the transferee was a foreign company the transfer would be subject to approval by governmental authorities such as the MIIT and the MOFCOM, and the transferee would be
	required to comply with various requirements, including qualification and maximum foreign shareholding percentage requirements. As these governmental authorities have wide discretion in granting such approvals, we could fail to obtain such approval.
	In addition, our VIE contracts might not be enforceable in China if PRC governmental authorities or courts or arbitral tribunals took the view that such contracts contravened PRC law or were otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons.

	Furthermore, the legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result,
	uncertainties in the PRC legal system could further limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event we were unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we would not be able to exert effective control over Gamease,
	Guanyou Gamespace, Shanghai ICE and Wuhan Baina Information, and our ability to conduct our business, and our financial condition and results of operations, would be severely adversely affected.

	The PRC government may decide to adopt more stringent policies to monitor the online game industry as a result of adverse

	Chinese online game operators to adopt an &#147;anti-fatigue system&#148; in an effort to curb addiction to online games by minors. Under the anti-fatigue system, three hours or less of continuous play is defined to be &#147;healthy,&#148; three to
	five hours is defined to be &#147;fatiguing,&#148; and five hours or more is defined to be &#147;unhealthy.&#148; Game operators are required to reduce the value of game benefits for minor game players by half when those game players reach the
	&#147;fatiguing&#148; level, and to zero when they reach the &#147;unhealthy&#148; level. In addition, online game players in China are now required to register their identity card numbers before they can play an online game. This system allows game
	operators to identify which game players are minors. These restrictions could limit our ability to increase our business among minors. If these restrictions were expanded to apply to adult game players in the future, our revenues could be adversely

	Notice&#146;s main focus is to prevent minors from using an adult&#146;s identity to play Internet games and, accordingly, provides stringent punishment for online game operators for not implementing the anti-fatigue and real name registration
	measures properly and effectively. The most severe punishment contemplated by the Real-name Registration Notice is termination of the operation of the online game if it is found to be in violation of the Anti-Fatigue Notice, the Real-name
	Registration Notice or the circular entitled
<I>
	Implementation of Online Game Monitor System of the Guardians of Minors
</I>
	, or the Monitor System Circular. The Real-name Registration Notice increases our operating risks, as we will be required to
	spend more resources on the real-name verification and anti-fatigue system, which will lead to an increase in our operating costs. In addition, the amount of time that minors will be able to spend playing online games such as ours will be further

<I>
	Notice on the Reinforcement
	of the Administration of Internet Caf&eacute;s and Online Games
</I>
	, or the Internet Caf&eacute;s Notice, issued by the MOC in 2007, directs the People&#146;s Bank of China, or the PBOC, to strengthen the administration of virtual currency in online
	games to avoid any adverse impact on the PRC economy and financial system. The Internet Caf&eacute;s Notice places strict limits on the total amount of virtual currency issued by online game operators in the PRC and the amount purchased by
	individual users in the PRC, and requires a clear division between virtual transactions and real transactions carried out by way of electronic commerce. The Internet Caf&eacute;s Notice also provides that virtual currency should only be used to
	purchase virtual items. In 2009, the MOC and the MOFCOM jointly issued the
<I>
	Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Online Game Virtual Currency
</I>
	, or the Virtual Currency Notice. In the Virtual Currency Notice, the MOC and the MOFCOM for
	the first time defined &#147;virtual currency&#148; as a type of virtual exchange instrument issued by online game operators, purchased directly or indirectly by the game user by exchanging legal currency at a certain exchange rate, saved outside
	the game programs, stored in servers provided by online game operators in electronic record format and represented by specific numeric units. In addition, the Virtual Currency Notice categorizes companies involved with virtual currency in the PRC as
	either issuers or trading platforms and prohibits companies from simultaneously operating both as issuers and as trading platforms. One of the Virtual Currency Notice&#146;s stated intended objectives is to limit the circulation of virtual currency
	and thereby reduce concerns that it may impact real world inflation. Specifically, the Virtual Currency Notice requires online game operators to report the total amount of their issued virtual currency on a quarterly basis, and game operators are
	prohibited from issuing disproportionate amounts of virtual currency in order to generate revenues. In addition, the Virtual Currency Notice reiterates that virtual currency can only be provided to users in exchange for an RMB payment and can only
	be used to pay for virtual goods and services of the issuers. Online game operators are prohibited from providing lucky draws or lotteries which are conducted on the condition that participants contribute cash or virtual currencies in exchange for
	game props or virtual currencies, and from providing virtual currency trading services to minors. The Virtual Currency Notice places additional potentially burdensome obligations on online game operators, including a requirement that operators keep
	transaction data records for no less than 180 days, which means that we must design and operate our databases so that we can maintain users&#146; information for the minimum required period, resulting in higher costs for our online game operations.
	We must tailor our business model carefully in order to comply with the overall requirements of the Virtual Currency Notice, in a manner which can be expected to result in relatively lower sales of our game coins and an adverse impact on our online
	game revenues.

	Currently, most of our game players in

	lack of other appealing forms of entertainment in China, many teenagers in China frequently play online games. This may result in these teenagers spending less time on or refraining from other activities, including education, vocational training,
	sports, and resting, which could result in adverse public reaction and stricter government regulation. For example, the PRC government has promulgated anti-fatigue-related regulations to limit the amount of time minors can play online games.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Adverse public opinion could discourage game players from playing our games, and could result in government regulations that impose additional
	limitations on the operations of online games as well as game players&#146; access to online games. For example, under the Monitor System Circular online game operators are required to adopt various measures to maintain a system to communicate with
	the parents of minors playing online games and are required to monitor the activities of minors and suspend the accounts of minors if so requested by their parents. We believe that stricter government regulations, such as regulations imposing
	stricter age and hour limits, limiting the issuance of virtual currency by online game operators or the amount of virtual currency that can be purchased by an individual game player, and extending anti-fatigue-related regulations to adults, could be
	implemented in the future. Any such adverse public opinion or tightened government regulations could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues.

	In addition, the PRC State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, has announced that it will tax game players on the income derived from the
	trading of virtual currencies at the rate of 20%. It is currently unclear how the tax will be collected or if there will be any effect on our game players or our business, but collection of such a tax might discourage players who are interested in

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are required to obtain applicable permits, approvals and
	registrations from, or make necessary filings with, different regulatory authorities in order to operate our online games. For example, as an online game operator in China, we must obtain an ICP license from the MIIT, an Online Cultural Operating
	Permit from the MOC and an Internet publishing license from the SAPPRFT in order to distribute games through the Internet. Any online game we operate needs to be approved by the SAPPRFT prior to its launch and filed with the MOC within 30 days after
	its launch. Once a new online game or any upgrade, expansion pack or new version of any existing game is launched, such new game or such upgrade, expansion pack or new version of such existing game must be filed with the MOC and approval must be
	obtained from the SAPPRFT for online publication. If we fail to maintain any of our permits, approvals or registrations, to make any necessary filings, or to apply for and obtain any new permits, approvals or registrations or make any new filings on
	a timely basis, we may be subject to various penalties, including fines and a requirement that we discontinue or limit our operations.

	As
	the online game industry is at an early stage of development in China, new law and regulations may be adopted from time to time to require additional licenses and permits other than those we currently have, and address new issues that arise. In
	addition, substantial uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and implementation of current and any future PRC law and regulations applicable to the online game industry. For example, there is ambiguity as to the division of authority and
	responsibilities between the SAPPRFT and the MOC with respect to regulating online games and, as a result, there may be overlapping approval requirements with respect to some aspects of our games or our game operations. On February 4, 2016, the
	SAPPRFT and the MIIT issued the
<I>
	Measures of Internet Publication Service Administration
</I>
	, or the New Internet Publication Measures, which will become effective on March 10, 2016. The New Internet Publication Measures strengthen the supervision
	of Internet publishing businesses and require that entities in the Internet publishing business apply for a new online publication license and obtain approval from the SAPPRFT prior to the publication of new online games. In addition, under the New
	Internet Publication Measures Sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign-invested entities are not permitted to engage in Internet publication services, and the legal representative of an entity providing Internet publication services may not be a
	foreigner. As the New Internet Publication Measures are new and have not yet become effective, the actual implications and reach of the New Internet Publication Measures are still uncertain. Furthermore, as mobile games are a new type of online
	game, there are uncertainties relating to whether a game developer, such as us, which provides mobile games to mobile device users, needs to obtain a separate operating license in addition to the ICP license that it has already obtained. For any
	mobile games we launch, we may be required to apply for a separate operating license for the mobile applications. Therefore, we may not be able to obtain timely, or at all, required licenses or any other new license required in the future, and we
	may be found to be in violation of current or future PRC law and regulations, which could impede our ability to conduct business.

	In September 2009, the SAPPRFT together with the National Copyright Administration, and the National Office of Combating Pornography and
	Illegal Publications jointly issued a
<I>
	Notice on Further Strengthening on the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Game and the Examination and Approval of Imported Online Game
</I>
	, or the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice. In the
	SAPPRFT Online Game Notice, the SAPPRFT states that it is the only governmental department with authority for examination and pre-approval of online games, and that all online game operators must obtain an Internet publishing license to provide
	online game services. Under the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice, additional approvals from the SAPPRFT are required when game operators release new versions or expansion packs, or make any changes to the originally approved online game. In addition, on
	July&nbsp;1, 2009, the SAPPRFT issued a
<I>
	Notice on Strengthening the Approval and Administration of Imported Online Games,
</I>
	in which the SAPPRFT stated that it is the only governmental department authorized by the State Council to approve the
	importation of online games from offshore copyright owners. In the event of any failure to meet the above-mentioned requirements, an operator may face heavy penalties, such as being ordered to stop operation, or having its business license revoked.
	Our online game business may be adversely affected by these two SAPPRFT notices. The launch of expansion packs and imported games might be delayed because of the extra approval required. Such delay in releasing expansion packs or imported games may
	result in higher costs for our online game operation and have an adverse effect on our game revenue.

	On June&nbsp;3, 2010, the MOC issued the
<I>
	Interim Measures for Online Games Administration
</I>
	,
	or the Online Game Measures, which became effective on August&nbsp;1, 2010, aiming to further strengthen the MOC&#146;s supervision of the online game industry. Specifically, the Online Game Measures reiterate that the MOC has the power to review
	the content of all online games except online game publications that have been pre-approved by the SAPPRFT. However, the Online Game Measures do not clearly specify what constitutes &#147;online game publication.&#148; Furthermore, the Online Game
	Measures provide that all domestic online games must be filed with the MOC, while all imported online games are subject to a content review prior to their launch. If a substantial change (for example, any significant modification to a game&#146;s

	Our online game business may be adversely affected by the Online Game Measures. The Online Game Measures do not set forth any specific
	procedure for the required filing and content review procedures for online games and therefore may cause delay when we try to file or apply for content review with the MOC. In addition, for our imported licensed games, the requirement for prior
	approval of any substantial change may cause delay in releasing expansion packs, which may result in higher costs of our online game operation and have an adverse effect on our game revenue. In addition, the Online Game Measures do not resolve
	certain inconsistencies and ambiguities resulting from pronouncements included in previous notices issued by the SAPPRFT and the MOC. Because there is ambiguity in the scope of the authority and the roles and responsibilities of governmental
	departments, such as the SAPPRFT and the MOC, with oversight of the online game industry, we may face stricter scrutiny of the day-to-day operations of our online game business. If any of our online game operating entities cannot comply with any of
	the stipulations of any PRC governmental department regarding the online game industry, we may be subject to various penalties and our online game business may be adversely affected.

	voting power in Changyou due to the additional voting power of the Class B ordinary shares it holds. Sohu&#146;s voting power gives it the power to control actions that require shareholder approval under Cayman Islands law, our memorandum and

	While the Chinese economy has grown significantly in the past 35 years, the growth has been uneven geographically among various sectors of the
	economy, and during different periods. The Chinese economy may not continue to grow, and if there is growth, such growth may not be steady and uniform; if there is a slowdown, such a slowdown may have a negative effect on our business. The Chinese
	economy experienced high inflation in 2010 and 2011, and to curb the accelerating inflation the PBOC, China&#146;s central bank, raised benchmark interest rates three times in 2011. Partly as a result of these measures, the real estate market in the
	PRC experienced significant declines in those years. The level of exports from the PRC also declined significantly recently. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the growth rate of China&#146;s gross domestic product, compared to
	that of the same period in the previous year, slowed from7.5% in 2012, 7.7% in 2013 and 7.4% in 2014 and 6.9% in 2015. Various macroeconomic measures and monetary policies adopted by the PRC government to guide economic growth and manage inflation
	and the allocation of resources may not be effective in sustaining the growth rate of the Chinese economy. In addition, such measures, even if they benefit the overall Chinese economy in the long run, may have an adverse effect on us if they reduce
	the disposable income of our game players or if they cause our advertising clients to reduce their spending for our online advertising services on the 17173.com Website.

	We are a holding company incorporated in the
	Cayman Islands which indirectly holds, through our Hong Kong subsidiaries, our equity interests in our subsidiaries in the PRC. Our business operations are principally conducted by our principal PRC subsidiaries and our principal VIEs. The CIT Law
	and its implementation rules provide that China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its overseas parent, will normally be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10%, unless there are applicable
	tax treaties that reduce such rate. Under the
<I>
	Arrangement Between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital
</I>
	, or the
	China-HK Tax Arrangement, the dividend withholding tax rate may be reduced to 5%, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is considered a non-PRC tax resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC enterprise distributing
	the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong resident enterprise is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividends may remain subject
	to withholding tax at a rate of 10%. On October&nbsp;27, 2009, the SAT, issued a
<I>
	Notice on How to Understand and Determine the Beneficial Owners in Tax Agreement
</I>
	, or Circular 601, which provides guidance on determining whether an enterprise
	is a &#147;beneficial owner&#148; under China&#146;s tax treaties and tax arrangements. Circular 601 provides that, in order to be a beneficial owner, an entity generally must be engaged in substantive business activities, and that a company that is
	set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits, will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and will not qualify for treaty benefits such as preferential dividend withholding tax rates. If any of our Hong
	Kong subsidiaries is, in the light of Circular 601, determined by the SAT to be a non-beneficial owner for purposes of the China-HK Tax Arrangement, any dividends paid to it by any of our PRC subsidiaries would not qualify for the preferential
	dividend withholding tax rate of 5%, but rather would be subject to the usual CIT Law rate of 10%.

	We believe we are not a PRC tax resident enterprise, but it is not clear whether we or any of our
	Hong Kong subsidiaries will be deemed to be PRC tax residents under the CIT Law. The tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term
	&#147;de facto management body&#148;. Under the CIT Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a &#147;de facto management body&#148; within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to
	the enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%. The implementation rules define the term &#147;de facto management body&#148; as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business,
	productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. On April&nbsp;22, 2009, the SAT issued a circular, known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &#147;de facto management body&#148; of a
	PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners,
	the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the SAT&#146;s general position on how the &#147;de facto management body&#148; text should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. Under Circular 82, an
	offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its &#147;de facto management body&#148; in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax
	on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i)&nbsp;the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii)&nbsp;decisions relating to the enterprise&#146;s financial and human resource matters
	are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii)&nbsp;the enterprise&#146;s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC;
	and (iv)&nbsp;at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. If we are considered as a PRC tax resident under the CIT law by the PRC tax authorities, our global income will be subject to corporate income tax
	at a rate of 25%.

	Although we intend to take the position that any dividends we pay to our overseas corporate shareholders or ADS holders

	gains realized by such shareholders or ADS holders from the transfer of our shares or ADSs may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate up to 10%. The implementation rules of the CIT Law provide
	that, if an enterprise that distributes dividends is domiciled in the PRC or if gains are realized from transferring equity interests of an enterprise domiciled in the PRC, then such dividends or gains are treated as &#147;China-sourced
	income.&#148; However, it is not clear how &#147;domicile&#148; might be interpreted under the CIT Law, and it is possible that domicile could be interpreted to mean the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a tax resident.

	Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, substantially all of our revenues are denominated in RMB. In July 2005, China reformed its
	exchange rate regime by establishing a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The RMB is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate will have some flexibility.
	If the RMB depreciates relative to the U.S.&nbsp;dollar, our revenues as expressed in our U.S.&nbsp;dollar financial statements will decline in value. Also, we currently have outstanding loans from overseas banks that are denominated in U.S.
	dollars.&nbsp;To repay these loans, we will need to first convert our cash denominated in RMB into U.S. dollars. If the RMB depreciates relative to the U.S.&nbsp;dollar, we will have to use a larger amount of cash in RMB for any such loan repayment.
	In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into U.S. dollars. On the other hand, our proceeds from overseas financings and from overseas game operations
	will decrease in value if we choose not to or are unable to convert the proceeds into RMB and the RMB appreciates against the U.S. dollar, which may reduce the value of a shareholder&#146;s investment in our ADSs.

	On May&nbsp;19, 2007, the PBOC announced a policy to expand the maximum daily floating range of
	RMB trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 0.3% to 0.5%. While the international reactions to the RMB revaluation and widening of the RMB&#146;s daily trading band have generally been positive,
	with the increased floating range of the RMB&#146;s value against foreign currencies, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term, depending on the fluctuation of
	the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued. On June&nbsp;19, 2010, the PBOC announced that it has decided to proceed further with the reform of the RMB exchange rate regime to enhance the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate, and
	that emphasis would be placed on reflecting market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. While so indicating its intention to make the RMB&#146;s exchange rate more flexible, the PBOC ruled out any sharp fluctuations in the
	currency or a one-off adjustment. On April&nbsp;16, 2012, the PBOC enlarged the floating band of RMB&#146;s trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 0.5% to 1% around the middle rate released by the
	China Foreign Exchange Trade System each day. In February 2014, the center point of the currency&#146;s official trading band hit 6.1146, representing appreciation of more than 11.7% since June&nbsp;19, 2010. On March&nbsp;17, 2014, the PBOC
	announced a policy to further expand the maximum daily floating range of RMB trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market to 2%. In the long term, the RMB may depreciate more significantly in value against

	In December 2012, the SEC instituted administrative proceedings against the Big Four PRC-based
	accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, alleging that these firms had violated U.S. securities laws and the SEC&#146;s rules and regulations thereunder by failing to provide to the SEC the firms&#146; audit
	work papers with respect to certain PRC-based companies that are publicly traded in the United States. On January&nbsp;22, 2014, the ALJ presiding over the matter rendered an initial decision that each of the firms had violated the SEC&#146;s rules
	of practice by failing to produce audit workpapers to the SEC. The initial decision censured each of the firms and barred them from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The Big Four PRC-based accounting firms appealed the ALJ&#146;s
	initial decision to the SEC. The ALJ&#146;s decision does not take effect unless and until it is endorsed by the SEC. On February&nbsp;6, 2015, the four China-based accounting firms each agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the
	dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC and audit U.S.-listed companies. The settlement required the firms to follow detailed procedures and to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms&#146; audit
	documents via the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC. If future document productions fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature
	of the failure. While we cannot predict if the SEC will further review the four China-based accounting firms&#146; compliance with specified criteria or if the results of such a review would result in the SEC imposing penalties such as suspensions
	or restarting the administrative proceedings, if the accounting firms are subject to additional remedial measures, our ability to file our financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements could be impacted. A determination that we have not

	A non-U.S. corporation will be
	considered a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for any taxable year if either (i)&nbsp;at least 75% of its gross income is passive income or (ii)&nbsp;at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of
	the assets during a taxable year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. We expect that we will not be treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our 2015 taxable year ending
	November&nbsp;30, 2015. Our expectation is based on our operations and the composition of our earnings and assets (including goodwill) for the 2015 taxable year, including the valuation of our assets based on the market price of our ADSs. However,
	we currently hold, and expect to continue to hold following this annual report, a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents, and the value of our other assets may be based in part on the market price of our ADSs, which is likely to fluctuate
	in the future (and may fluctuate considerably given that market prices of Internet and online game companies historically have been especially volatile). A drop in the market price of our ADSs and an associated decrease in the value of our goodwill
	would cause a reduction in the value of our non-passive assets for purposes of the asset test. Accordingly, we could become a PFIC if our market capitalization were to decrease significantly while we hold substantial cash and cash equivalents.
	Furthermore, it is not entirely clear how the contractual arrangements between us and our consolidated variable interest entities will be treated for purposes of the PFIC rules. In addition, our actual PFIC status for any taxable year will not be
	determinable until the close of such taxable year. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that we will not be a PFIC for any taxable year. PFIC status depends on the composition of our assets and income and the value of our assets (including, among
	others, a pro rata portion of the income and assets of each regarded subsidiary in which we own, directly or indirectly, at least 25% (by value) of the equity interest) from time to time. If we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during
	which a U.S. holder held an ADS or a Class&nbsp;A ordinary share, certain adverse United States federal income tax consequences could apply to the U.S. holder. See &#147;Taxation&#151;United States Federal Income Taxation&#151;Passive Foreign

	noncontrolling shareholders of MoboTap will have a one-time right to put to Changyou shares of MoboTap held by them, representing up to 15% of the equity interests in MoboTap, for an aggregate price of up to $53 million. We also acquired from
	MoboTap for $30&nbsp;million a zero-coupon convertible bond issued by MoboTap, due in 2019. In January 2016, we reached an agreement with MoboTap pursuant to which MoboTap redeemed $24 million of the convertible bond and we have the option,
	exercisable at any time when the bond is outstanding, to convert the remainder of the bond at a rate that would increase our interest in MoboTap to 53.1% on a fully-diluted basis if the option is exercised in full.

	third-party mobile application stores or, to a lesser extent, from our official game Website. Prior to the sale of Shenzhen 7Road in August 2015, our online games also included Web games, which became a relatively insignificant part of our online

	Our online games include a variety of genres, including MMOGs, RPGs, MMORPGs, ARPGs, TPSs and CCGs.
	MMOGs are massive multiplayer online games that allow a large number of players to interact with one another within a virtual world. RPGs are role playing games that allow users to take on the role of a character that can interact within a
	game&#146;s imaginary world. MMORPGs and ARPGs are subsets of RPGs, with MMORPGs emphasizing the interaction of a large number of players and ARPGs emphasizing real-time action where a player has direct control over characters and enjoys various
	forms of combat systems. TPSs are third person shooter games that are structured around shooting, where a player can see and control an avatar on-screen in a third-person view. CCGs are collectible card games in which players collect cards and
	compete to win by using card sets with different functions.

	features. After testing, the game updates and expansion packs are typically distributed electronically through a game Website hosted by us or by third parties. We have found that expansion packs effectively increase game players&#146; interest in
	the game and enhance the game-playing experience by keeping the game-playing experience fresh even for long-time game players. We believe that the expansion packs help us to maintain game player loyalty, and in turn extend the lifespans of our

	Various PRC regulations currently restrict foreign-invested entities from engaging in value-added telecommunication services, including
	operating online games and providing Internet information services. Foreign direct investment in telecommunication companies in China is regulated by the
<I>
	Regulations for the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises
</I>
	,
	or the FITE Regulations, issued by the State Council, which became effective in January 2002 and were amended in September 2008. The FITE Regulations stipulate that telecommunications enterprises in the PRC with foreign investors, or FITEs, must be
	established as Sino-foreign equity joint ventures. Under the FITE Regulations and in accordance with WTO-related agreements, FITEs may provide value-added telecommunications services, but the foreign party to a FITE engaging in such services may
	hold no more than 50% of the equity of the FITE. The FITE Regulations do not impose geographical restrictions on the operations of a FITE. The PRC government has not made any commitment to liberalize its regulation of the operations of FITEs&#146;
	providing value-added telecommunications services.

	For a FITE to acquire any equity interest in a value-added telecommunications business
	in China, it must satisfy a number of stringent performance and operational experience requirements, including demonstrating a track record and experience in operating a value-added telecommunications business overseas. Moreover, FITEs that meet
	these requirements must obtain approvals from the MIIT and the MOFCOM or their authorized local counterparts, which retain considerable discretion in granting approvals.

	In July 2006, the MIIT released a
<I>
	Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in Operating Value-added
	Telecommunications Business
</I>
	, or the MIIT Notice, which reiterates certain provisions under the FITE Regulations. Under the MIIT Notice, if a FITE intends to invest in a PRC value-added telecommunications business, the FITE must be established
	and must apply for telecommunications business license applicable to its business. Under the MIIT Notice, a domestic company that holds a license for the provision of Internet content services, or an ICP license, as a type of value-added
	telecommunications business in China, is prohibited from leasing, transferring or selling the license to foreign investors in any form, and from providing any assistance, including providing resources, sites or facilities, to foreign investors to
	conduct value-added telecommunications businesses illegally in China. Trademarks and domain names that are used in the provision of Internet content services must be owned by the ICP license holder. The MIIT Notice requires each ICP license holder
	to have appropriate facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunications service providers are required to maintain network and
	information security in accordance with the standards set forth under relevant PRC regulations. Our VIEs, rather than our subsidiaries hold ICP licenses, own our domain names, and hold or have applied for registration in the PRC of trademarks
	related to our games and our 17173.com Website and own and maintain facilities that we believe are appropriate for our business operations.

	The PRC Constitution states that PRC law protects the freedom and privacy of the communications of citizens and prohibits infringement of such
	rights. In recent years, PRC government authorities have issued various regulations on the use of the Internet that are designed to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure. For example, the Internet Measures prohibit an Internet
	information services provider from insulting or slandering a third party or infringing upon the lawful rights and interests of a third party. In addition, PRC regulations authorize PRC telecommunication authorities to demand rectification of
	unauthorized disclosure by ICPs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	PRC law does not prohibit ICPs from collecting and analyzing personal information from their users. The
	PRC government, however, has the power and authority to order ICPs to submit personal information of an Internet user if such user posts any prohibited content or engages in illegal activities on the Internet. In addition, the MIIT promulgated the
<I>
	Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services
</I>
	, which became effective as of March&nbsp;15, 2012. This regulation stipulates that ICPs must not, without users&#146; consent, collect information on users
	that can be used, alone or in combination with other information, to identify the user, or User Personal Information, and may not provide any User Personal Information to third parties without prior user consent. ICPs may only collect User Personal
	Information necessary to provide their services and must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and processing of such User Personal Information. In addition, an ICP may use User Personal Information only for
	the stated purposes under the ICP&#146;s scope of services. ICPs are also required to ensure the proper security of User Personal Information, and take immediate remedial measures if User Personal Information is suspected to have been disclosed. If
	the consequences of any such disclosure are expected to be serious, the ICP must immediately report the incident to the telecommunications regulatory authorities and cooperate with the authorities in their investigations. In addition, the PRC
	government has the power and authority to order ICPs to submit personal information of an Internet user if such user posts any prohibited content or engages in any illegal activity on the Internet. We require our users to accept a user agreement
	whereby they agree to provide certain personal information to us. If we violate these regulations, the MIIT or its local bureaus may impose penalties and we may be liable for damages caused to our users.

	is necessary for the services it provides. Further, the operator must disclose to its users the purpose, method and scope of any such collection or use, and must obtain consent from its users whose information is being collected or used. ICP
	operators are also required to establish and publish their rules relating to personal information collection or use, keep any collected information strictly confidential, and take technological and other measures to maintain the security of such
	information. ICP operators are required to cease any collection or use of the user personal information, and de-register the relevant user account, when a given user stops using the relevant Internet service. ICP operators are further prohibited
	from divulging, distorting or destroying any such personal information, or selling or providing such information unlawfully to other parties. In addition, if an ICP operator appoints an agent to undertake any marketing or technical services that
	involve the collection or use of personal information, the ICP operator is still required to supervise and manage the protection of the information. The Order states that violators may face penalties that include warnings, fines, and disclosure to

	On February&nbsp;21, 2008, the SAPPRFT issued the Rules for the Administration of Electronic

	business operations involving electronic publishing. Under the Electronic Publication Rules and other related regulations issued by the SAPPRFT, online games are classified as a type of electronic publication or Internet publication that may only be
	provided by a licensed electronic publishing entity with a standard publication code, and the establishment of an electronic publishing entity must be approved by the SAPPRFT. Electronic publishing entities are responsible for assuring that the
	content of electronic publications comply with relevant PRC law and regulations, and must obtain the approval of the SAPPRFT before publishing foreign electronic publications. The Tentative Measures for Internet Publication Administration, or the

	to select, edit and process content or programs and to make such content or programs publicly available on the Internet. As the provision of online games is deemed to be an Internet publication activity, an online game operator must obtain an
	Internet publishing license and an authorization codes for each of its games in operation in order to directly make those games publicly available in the PRC. Although the Internet Publication Measures do not specifically authorize such a practice,
	an online game operator is generally able to publish its games and obtain authorization codes for those games through third-party licensed electronic publishing entities and register the games with the SAPPRFT as electronic publications. The New
	Internet Publication Measures issued by the SAPPRFT and the MIIT, which will become effective on March 10, 2016 and will replace the Internet Publication Measures, require that entities in the Internet publishing business apply for a new online
	publication license and obtain approval from the SAPPRFT prior to the publication of new online games. In addition, under the New Internet Publication Measures Sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign-invested entities are not permitted to engage in
	Internet publication services, and the legal representative of an entity providing Internet publication services may not be a foreigner. As the New Internet Publication Measures are new and have not yet become effective, the actual implications and
	reach of the New Internet Publication Measures are still uncertain.

	be &#147;unhealthy.&#148; Game operators are required to reduce the value of in-game benefits to a game player by half if the game player has reached &#147;fatiguing&#148; level, and to zero in the case of &#147;unhealthy&#148; level.

	To identify whether a game player is a minor and thus subject to the anti-fatigue system, there was adopted a real-name registration system,
	which requires online game players to register their real identity information before they play online games and requires us to submit the identity information of game players to the public security authorities for verification. On July&nbsp;1,

	, or the Real-name Registration
	Notice, to strengthen the implementation of the anti-fatigue system and real-name registration, which took effect on October&nbsp;1, 2011. The Real-name Registration Notice&#146;s main focus is to prevent minors from using an adult&#146;s ID to play
	Internet games and, accordingly, the notice imposes stringent punishments on online game operators that do not implement the required anti-fatigue and real-name registration measures properly and effectively. The most severe punishment contemplated
	by the Real-name Registration Notice is to require termination of the operation of the online game if it is found to be in violation of the Anti-Fatigue Notice, the Monitor System Circular or the Real-name Registration Notice. We developed our own
	anti-fatigue and real-name registration systems for our games, and implemented them beginning in 2007. Under our system, game players must use real identification in order to create accounts, and in this way, we are able to tell which of our game
	players are minors and thus subject to these regulations. For game players who do not register, we assume that they are minors. In order to comply with the anti-fatigue rules, game players under 18 years of age only receive half of the experience
	time they actually earn after three hours of play. And, after five hours of play, minors receive no experience points. We use this system to disincentivize minors from playing in excess of five hours at a time.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our three primary businesses are the online game business; the platform channel business, which consists of online advertising and software
	offerings; and the others business. The online game business and the platform channel business are our core businesses. We are a leading online game developer and operator in China as measured by the popularity of TLBB and our mobile game TLBB 3D.
	We engage in the development, operation and licensing of online games for PCs and mobile devices. This includes PC games, which are interactive online games that are accessed and played simultaneously by hundreds of thousands of game players through
	personal computers and require that local game client-end access software be installed on the computers used; mobile games, which are played on mobile devices and require an Internet connection; and Web games, which are online games that are played
	through a Web browser with no local game software installation requirements. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, the online games that we operate had approximately 7.3 million total average monthly active accounts and 2.1 million total
	active paying accounts. The revenues generated from the online games are classified as online game revenues.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our platform channel
	business mainly consists of the operation of the 17173.com Website, one of the leading information portals in China, which provides news, electronic forums, online videos and other information services on online games to game players.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our other services offerings include the sale, to advertisers, of pre-film cinema advertising slots, which are advertisements shown before the
	screening of a movie in a cinema theatre.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	General economic conditions affecting our business
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have benefited from general conditions typically affecting the online game, online advertising and cinema advertising industries in China,
	including the overall economic growth, which has resulted in increases in disposable income and discretionary consumer spending and increases in advertising spending; the increasing use of the Internet with the growth of personal computers, mobile
	phones and broadband penetration; the growing popularity of online games in comparison with other forms of entertainment. We cannot assure you that the Chinese economy will continue to grow, or that if there is growth, such growth will be steady and
	uniform and that any such growth will lead to growth in our online game business, our online advertising, or our cinema advertising business or that if there is a slowdown, such slowdown will not have a negative effect on those businesses. For
	example, a slowdown in China&#146;s economic growth that occurred between the first quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2012 and during 2014 and 2015, caused in part by measures adopted by the Chinese government intended to slow such growth and
	to temper real estate prices and inflation, the significant instability recently experienced in the worldwide economy, with growth in the United States slowing, and the European Community facing disruptions as a result of crises in the economies of
	Greece and Spain, among other countries, and other such factors may lead in the future to decreases in the level of disposable income of our game players and negatively affect their spending on playing online games, as well as decreases in the
	advertising spending of our advertisers, who are typically other leading online game companies in China.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The popularity of our games drives the growth of our game player base, which is the key component driving the sales and consumption of our
	virtual items and thus our revenues. To maintain and grow the popularity of our games, we must diligently maintain the quality of the games and continually enhance the games to meet game player preferences. We solicit feedback from our game players
	and have a dedicated product development team that helps us to identify market trends and user preferences. For TLBB, we typically provide weekly updates and more substantial enhancements in the form of expansion packs every few months. For mobile
	games such as TLBB 3D, we provide updates and expansion packs on a more frequent basis. If we fail to meet game player demands and maintain their satisfaction from playing our games, game players may leave the game, which would have an adverse
	effect on our revenues.

	The shift away from PC games to new game products and services, and to mobile games in particular
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For several years we have relied, and currently rely, on our popular game TLBB for a substantial portion of our revenues. However, the
	popularity of PC games continues to decline and an increasing number of online game developers are delaying or suspending their plans to develop and launch new PC games, as game players increasingly switch to mobile devices to access online games.
	As a result, we consider it to be essential to the prospects for the growth of our online game business that we shift considerable resources to the development of mobile games. Mobile games, even if successful, tend to have shorter lifespans than PC
	games, as the attention of users tend to shift rapidly away from existing mobile games, even those that are initially very successful, to mobile games that are new to the market. For example, our mobile game TLBB 3D was quite popular upon its launch
	in late 2014, but declined in popularity through 2015. We therefore consider it to be important for us to create a substantial pipeline of mobile games, either through in-house development, or through the licensing of rights from third-party
	developers. We also must anticipate that a number of our mobile games will not be accepted by the game-player market, even upon initial launch. Further, we generally operate, and expect that we will continue to operate, mobile games primarily
	through third-party platforms that require that we enter into revenue-sharing arrangements that provide for significant revenue-sharing payments to the operators of the platforms, and that, accordingly, our profit margins from mobile games are, and
	are likely to be, lower than those that we enjoy from PC games.

	Developing and marketing a new online game and maintaining its popularity in the market requires a commitment of significant resources,

	We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an
	annual basis as of October&nbsp;1, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. Commencing in September 2011, in accordance with the FASB revised guidance on
	&#147;Testing of Goodwill for Impairment,&#148; a company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For those
	reporting units where it was determined that it was more likely than not that their fair values were less than the units&#146; carrying amounts, we performed the first step of a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. After performing the
	assessment, if the carrying amounts of the reporting units were higher than their fair values, we performed the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.

	If the company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
	less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value. Application of a
	goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each
	reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially
	affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.

	The carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
	indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
	assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
	the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. We test impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets at the reporting unit level when impairment indicator appeared and recognizes impairment in the event that the carrying value exceeds
	the fair value of each reporting unit.

	In accordance with ASC subtopic 480-10, we calculated, on an accumulative basis from the acquisition date, (i)&nbsp;the amount of accretion

	consolidated financial statements. Following the closing of the acquisition, $2.4&nbsp;million, representing the excess of the amount of the mezzanine-classified non-controlling interest in 7Road over the purchase price as of the closing date, was

	For share-based awards, in determining the fair value of ordinary shares, restricted shares and
	restricted share units granted before the shares underlying the awards were publicly traded, the income approach/discounted cash flow method with a discount for lack of marketability is applied. In determining the fair value of restricted share
	units granted shortly before our initial public offering, the fair value of the underlying shares was determined based on the offering price in the initial public offering. In determining the fair value of restricted share units granted after our
	initial public offering, the public market price of the underlying shares on the grant dates is applied. In determining the fair value of share options granted by Sohu to our employees prior to our initial public offering, we applied the
	Black-Scholes valuation model.

	Determining the fair value of the ordinary shares not publicly traded required complex and subjective
	judgments regarding our projected financial and operating results, our unique business risks, the liquidity of our ordinary shares and our operating history and prospects at the time the grants were made. The assumptions used in share-based
	compensation expense recognition represent our management&#146;s best estimates based on historical experience and consideration to developing expectations about the future. However, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application
	of management judgment. If factors change or different assumptions were used, the share-based compensation expense could be materially different for any period. Moreover, the estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events
	or the value that ultimately will be realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us for accounting purposes.

	On February&nbsp;8, 2014, our Board of Directors approved three new employee incentive plans with terms of 10 years, commencing
	January&nbsp;1, 2014. Under two of these three plans, we could have distributed cash compensation of up to 10% of our company-wide annual net profits after certain adjustments. The third employee incentive plan was structured to allow eligible
	employees to receive up to 20% of the annual adjusted net profits of projects that they worked on. In December 2014, our management reassessed the estimated compensation expense related to these three employee incentive plans and we reversed
	accruals associated with the compensation expense previously recognized for these plans in a total amount of $32.2 million. Our management also recommended cancelling the three employee incentive plans, and replacing them with a new cash bonus plan
	commencing in 2015. Our Board of Directors approved the cancellation of the three incentive plans on February&nbsp;7, 2015.

	In order to assess uncertain tax positions, we apply a more likely than not threshold and a two-step approach for the tax position measurement
	and financial statement recognition. For the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
	sustained, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement.

	In 2014, we expanded our online game business to include mobile games, and the CODMs determined that the operation of mobile games should be

	offered to game players Web games of third-party developers. The CODMs determined that the software applications for PCs and mobile devices and the wan.com Website should be reviewed together as one operating segment, identified as the software

	revenues of older games, such as TLBB. The year-over-year decrease in PC games revenues for 2014 was $46.6 million, mainly due to decreased revenues from TLBB, following the strategic decision to reduce the game&#146;s difficulty. For 2015, our

	Our primary Web games prior to our sale of Shenzhen 7Road in August 2015 were Wartune and DDTank. Our revenues generated from Web games were
	$45.9 million for 2015, compared to $100.7 million and $135.7 million, respectively, for 2014 and 2013. The year-over-year decrease in Web game revenues for 2015 was $54.8 million, mainly due to a decrease in Web game revenues upon the completion of
	the sale of the 7Road business during the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decrease in Web games revenues for 2014 was $35.0 million, mainly due to decreased revenues in China from Wartune and DDTank, which had reached a mature phase in
	their operation.

	To fund any cash requirements from time to time, we may need to rely on dividends, loans or advances made by our principal PRC subsidiaries. We
	conduct most of our operations in PRC through our principal VIEs Gamease, Guanyou Gamespace, Shanghai ICE and Wuhan Baina Information, which generate most of our operating revenues. As our VIEs are not owned by our subsidiaries, they are not able to
	make dividend payments to our subsidiaries. Instead, our subsidiaries AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology have entered into a number of contracts with their corresponding VIEs to provide services to such VIEs in return for cash
	payments. In order for us to receive any dividends, loans or advances from AmazGame, Gamespace or Beijing Baina Technology, or to distribute any dividends to our shareholders and ADS holders from operating income sources, we will need to rely on
	these payments made from our principal VIEs to these principal PRC subsidiaries. Depending on the nature of services provided by these PRC subsidiaries to their corresponding VIEs, certain of these payments are subject to PRC taxes, including
	business taxes and VAT, which effectively reduce the amount that a PRC subsidiary receives from its corresponding VIE. In addition, the PRC government could impose restrictions on such payments or change the tax rates applicable to such payments.

	IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On May 28, 2014, the FASB and IASB issued their long-awaited converged standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.
	The standard is intended to improve the financial reporting of revenue and improve comparability of the top line in financial statements globally. The FASB is amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creating a new Topic 606, Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers, to supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. Additionally, the amendments supersede some
	cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition &#151; Construction &#151; Type and Production &#151; Type Contracts. For a public business entity, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
	2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2015, the FASB issued Consolidation (Topic 810) &#151; Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The amendments in Topic 810
	respond to stakeholders&#146; concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities, by changing aspects of the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate such entities.
	Under the amendments, all reporting entities are within the scope of Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation &#151; Overall, including limited partnerships and similar legal entities, unless a scope exception applies. The amendments are intended to be an
	improvement to current U.S. GAAP, as they simplify the codification of FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), with changes including reducing the number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite
	deferral of Statement 167 and placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments are effective for publicly-traded companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim
	periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which eliminates the
	requirement for acquirers in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the
	effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early
	adoption permitted. The implementation of this update is not expected to have any material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies
	the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
	beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. All short-term deferred tax assets and liabilities will be reclassified to long-term assets and liabilities upon adoption of this update.

	On February&nbsp;8, 2014, our Board of Directors approved three new employee incentive plans with terms of 10 years, commencing January&nbsp;1,
	2014. Under two of these three plans, we could have distributed cash compensation of up to 10% of our company-wide annual net profits after certain adjustments. The third employee incentive plan was structured to allow eligible employees to receive
	up to 20% of the annual adjusted net profits of projects that they worked on. In December 2014, our management reassessed the estimated compensation expense related to these three employee incentive plans and we reversed accruals associated with the
	compensation expense previously recognized for these plans in a total amount of $32.2 million. Our management also recommended cancelling the three employee incentive plans, and replacing them with a new cash bonus plan commencing in 2015. Our Board
	of Directors approved the cancellation of the three incentive plans on February&nbsp;7, 2015.

	contingent upon the completion of an initial public offering by us on an internationally recognized stock exchange, and the restricted share units are otherwise subject to vesting over a four-year period, subject to acceleration under certain
	circumstances, commencing February&nbsp;1, 2008. On April&nbsp;21, 2009, we granted to our then executive officers other than Tao Wang an aggregate of 1,200,000 of our Class&nbsp;A restricted share units under our 2008 Share Incentive Plan. These

	nominating committees. Because more than 50% of the voting power of our company is held by Sohu, we qualify as a &#147;controlled company&#148; under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and we avail ourselves of the controlled company exception provided under
	those rules. In the event that we are no longer a controlled company, a majority of our Board of Directors will be required to be independent and it will be necessary for us to have compensation and corporate governance and nominating committees
	that are composed entirely of independent directors, subject to a phase-in period during the first year we cease to be a controlled company, unless we invoke the home country exception to such requirement available to foreign private issuers, such
	as us, under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

	Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Law Cap. 22 (Law&nbsp;3 of 1961, as
	consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands (the &#147;Companies Law&#148;) regarding mergers and similar arrangements that are applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the laws of the Cayman Islands, two or more companies may merge or consolidate in accordance with Part XVI of the Companies Law. Merger
	means the merging of two or more constituent companies into a sole remaining constituent company or surviving company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and liabilities of the constituent companies in the surviving company. Consolidation
	means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a new consolidated company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and liabilities of the constituent companies in the consolidated company. The directors of each constituent
	company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation (the &#147;Plan&#148;). The Plan must contain certain prescribed information including the effective date of the merger or consolidation; the basis of cancelling the shares in a
	constituent company in exchange for the relevant consideration or converting the shares in each constituent company into shares of the consolidated company or surviving company and the rights attached thereto; any proposed amendments to the
	memorandum and articles of association of the surviving company in a merger or the proposed new memorandum and articles of association of the consolidated company in a consolidation; and details of all secured creditors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Plan must be approved by each constituent company by way of (a)&nbsp;a special resolution of the shareholders; and (b)&nbsp;such other
	authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company&#146;s articles of association. Shareholders do not need to approve a merger between a Cayman Islands parent company and a Cayman Islands subsidiary. For this purpose a
	subsidiary is a company of which at least 90% of the issued shares entitled to vote are owned by the parent company.

	China&#146;s government imposes control over the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies,
	including U.S. dollars, has been based on rates announced by the People&#146;s Bank of China. On July&nbsp;21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the RMB
	is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar by the end of 2014. While the international
	reaction to the RMB revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of
	the RMB against the U.S. dollar.

	the basis of, inter alia, the terms of the relevant joint venture contracts and the board resolutions declaring the distribution of the dividend and payment of profits. On January&nbsp;14, 1997, the State Council amended the Foreign Exchange
	Administration Regulations and added, among other things, an important provision, as Article 5 provides that the State shall not impose restrictions on recurring international current account payments and transfers. Conversion of RMB into foreign

	The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no
	taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or brought
	within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.

	We are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and hold our equity interests
	in AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology, our principal PRC subsidiaries, indirectly through Changyou HK and MoboTap HK, our principal Hong Kong subsidiaries. A significant portion of our business operations are conducted by these PRC
	subsidiaries through our principal VIEs Gamease, Guanyou Gamespace, Shanghai ICE and Wuhan Baina Information. The CIT Law and its implementation rules provide that China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC
	subsidiary to its overseas parent that is not a PRC resident enterprise and has no establishment in the PRC, will normally be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10%, unless there are applicable tax treaties that reduce such rate. Under the
	China-HK Tax Arrangement, such dividend withholding tax rate may be reduced to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is considered a non-PRC tax resident enterprise and owns at least 25% of equity interests in the PRC company distributing the
	dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong resident enterprise is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividends may remain subject to
	withholding tax at a rate of 10%. On October&nbsp;27, 2009, the SAT issued Circular 601, which provides guidance on determining whether an enterprise is a &#147;beneficial owner&#148; under China&#146;s tax treaties and tax arrangements. Circular
	601 provides that, in order to be a beneficial owner, an entity generally must be engaged in substantive business activities, and that a company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits,
	will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and will not qualify for treaty benefits such as preferential dividend withholding tax rates. If any of our Hong Kong subsidiaries is, in the light of Circular 601, considered to be a non-beneficial owner
	for purposes of the China-HK Tax Arrangement, any dividends paid to it by any of our PRC subsidiaries would not qualify for the preferential dividend withholding tax rate of 5%, but rather would be subject to withholding tax at the usual CIT Law
	rate of 10%.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the CIT Law, enterprises established under the laws of jurisdictions outside China with their &#147;de facto
	management bodies&#148; located within China may be considered to be PRC tax resident enterprises for tax purposes. A substantial majority of the members of our management team as well as the management team of Changyou HK, ICE HK and MoboTap HK are
	located in China. If we were to be considered a PRC tax resident enterprise under the CIT Law, then our global income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25%. Similarly, if Changyou HK, ICE HK or MoboTap HK were to be
	considered a PRC tax resident enterprise, then its global income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25%.

	The implementation rules of the CIT Law provide that, (i)&nbsp;if the enterprise that distributes dividends is domiciled in the PRC, or
	(ii)&nbsp;if gains are realized from transferring equity interests of enterprises domiciled in the PRC, then such dividends or capital gains are treated as China-sourced income. It is not clear how &#147;domicile&#148; may be interpreted under the
	CIT Law, and it may be interpreted as the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a tax resident. Therefore, if we and Changyou HK are considered as a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders or
	ADS holders as well as gains realized by such shareholders or ADS holders from the transfer of our shares or ADSs may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result become subject to PRC withholding tax at the rate up to 10%. See &#147;Risk

	Subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed

	and profits (as determined under United States federal income tax principles). To the extent, if any, that the amount of any such distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, it will be treated first as a tax-free return of
	the U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in the ADSs or the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares (thereby increasing the amount of any gain or decreasing the amount of any loss realized on the subsequent sale or disposition of such ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary
	shares) and thereafter as capital gain. U.S. holders should note that we do not intend to calculate our earnings and profits under United States federal income tax principles. Therefore, a U.S. holder should expect that a distribution generally will
	be reported as a dividend even if that distribution should be treated as a non-taxable return of capital or as capital gain under the rules described above. Further, the dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to

	With respect to certain non-corporate U.S. holders,

	tradable on an established securities market in the United States, (2)&nbsp;we are not treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to the U.S. holder (as discussed below) for our taxable year in which the dividend was paid and we
	were not a passive foreign investment company in the preceding taxable year, and (3)&nbsp;certain holding period requirements are met. Under Internal Revenue Service authority, our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, or ADSs representing such shares, will
	be considered for the purpose of clause (1)&nbsp;above to be readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States if they are listed (as our ADSs currently are) on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. U.S. holders should consult
	their tax advisors regarding the availability of the lower rate for dividends paid with respect to our ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. Dividends will constitute foreign source income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. If the dividends
	are taxed as qualified dividend income (as discussed above), the amount of the dividend taken into account for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit limitation will be limited to the gross amount of the dividend, multiplied by the reduced
	tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income and divided by the highest tax rate normally applicable to dividends. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. For
	foreign tax credit purposes, dividends paid on our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will generally constitute &#147;passive category income&#148; but could, in the case of certain U.S. holders, constitute &#147;general category income.&#148;

	therefore, U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit in such U.S. holders&#146; particular circumstances.

	We believe that we will not be treated as a passive foreign investment company (&#147;PFIC&#148;) for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ending November&nbsp;30, 2015. Our expectation is based on our operations and the composition of our earnings and assets for the 2015 taxable year, including the valuation of our assets
	(including goodwill) based on the expected price of our ADSs in the market. However, because we currently hold, and expect to continue to hold a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents, and because the value of our other assets may be based
	in part on the market price of our ADSs, which has fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate (and may fluctuate considerably given that market prices of internet and online game companies historically have been especially volatile), our PFIC
	status may depend in large part on the market price of our ADSs. A drop in the market price of our ADSs and associated decrease in the value of our goodwill would cause a reduction in the value of our non-passive assets for purposes of the asset
	test. Accordingly, we could become a PFIC if our market capitalization were to decrease significantly while we hold substantial cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the composition of our income and assets will be affected by how, and how
	quickly, we spend our cash. Furthermore, it is not entirely clear how the contractual arrangements between us and our consolidated VIEs will be treated for purposes of the PFIC rules. If these contractual arrangements were found by PRC authorities
	with appropriate jurisdiction to be unenforceable, this could cause more than 75% of our gross income or more than 50% of our assets to be passive in the year that this finding was made or in subsequent years, which could cause us to be classified
	as a PFIC. See &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure and PRC Law and Regulations&#151;Our contractual arrangements with our VIEs and their shareholders may not be as effective in providing control over our VIEs as direct
	ownership of the VIEs and the shareholders of our VIEs may have conflicts of interest with us or with each other.&#148; Also our actual PFIC status for any taxable year will depend upon the character of our income and assets and the value of our
	assets for such year, which will not be determinable until after the close of the taxable year. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that we will not be a PFIC for any taxable year.

	fair market value of the ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares as of the close of such U.S. holder&#146;s taxable year over such U.S. holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in such ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. The U.S. holder will be allowed a

	ordinary shares. A U.S. holder&#146;s basis in the ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts. If the U.S. holder makes a mark-to-market election, tax rules that apply to distributions by
	corporations which are not PFICs would apply to distributions by us (except that the lower applicable capital gains rate for &#147;qualified dividend income&#148; discussed above would not apply). The basis adjustment and income or loss inclusion

	While our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, to date the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in RMB and a significant
	portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollar and RMB. If the RMB
	depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the value of our RMB revenues and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline. For example, as reported in our U.S. dollar financial statements included in this annual report, our
	revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 were $761.6 million and our total assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 were $1.78 billion, representing revenues of RMB 4.95 billion and total assets of RMB11.6 billion at the noon buying rate of RMB
	6.4936 to $1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2015. If the value of the RMB were to depreciate by approximately 10% to RMB 7.1430 to $1.00, the value of the same amount of RMB-denominated revenue and total assets in U.S. dollars would be $692.4 million and
	$1.62 billion, respectively. Also, we currently have outstanding loans from overseas banks that are denominated in U.S. dollars. To repay these loans, we will need to first convert our cash denominated in RMB into U.S. dollars. If the RMB
	depreciates relative to the U.S.&nbsp;dollar, we will have to use a larger amount of cash in RMB for any such loan repayment. For example, as reported in our U.S. dollar financial statements included in this annual report, our loans denominated in
	U.S. dollars as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 aggregated $344.5 million. We needed RMB2.24 billion to settle these loans at the noon buying rate of RMB 6.4936 to $1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2015. If the value of the RMB were to depreciate by
	approximately 10% to RMB 7.1430 to $1.00, we would have to use RMB2.46 billion to settle loans in the same aggregate amount. We do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk. See &#147;Risk
	Factors&#151;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#151;We have suffered currency exchange losses, and we may continue to suffer currency exchange losses if the RMB continues to depreciate relative to the U.S.&nbsp;dollar, and fluctuations in the

	The RMB is currently freely
	convertible under the &#147;current account,&#148; which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the &#147;capital account,&#148; which includes foreign direct investment. In addition, commencing on
	July&nbsp;21, 2005, China reformed its exchange rate regime by changing to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. Provisions on Administration of Foreign Exchange, as
	amended in August 2008, further changed China&#146;s exchange regime to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand. Under the managed floating exchange rate regime, the RMB is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar. The
	exchange rate of the RMB against the U.S. dollar was adjusted to RMB 8.11&nbsp;per U.S. dollar as of July&nbsp;22, 2005, representing an appreciation of about 2%. The People&#146;s Bank of China will announce the closing prices of foreign currencies
	such as the U.S. dollar traded against the RMB in the inter-bank foreign exchange market after the closing of the market on each business day, and will make such prices the central parity for trading against the RMB on the following business day. On
	May&nbsp;19, 2007, the People&#146;s Bank of China announced a policy to expand the maximum daily floating range of RMB trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 0.3% to 0.5%. While the international
	reactions to the RMB revaluation and widening of the RMB&#146;s daily trading band have generally been positive, with the increased floating range of the RMB&#146;s value against foreign currencies, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly
	in value against the U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term, depending on the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to
	reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure. Accordingly, we
	may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

	During 2014, we drew down

	all carried a floating rate of interest based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. The fair value of our fixed interest rate loans will fluctuate with movements of market interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of
	interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon the prevailing interest rates in the market, the fair value of our loans was $344.5 million at December&nbsp;31, 2015. Based on our interest-bearing loans in 2015, a 10%
	change in the interest rate would result in an increase or decrease of $0.7 million of our total amount of interest expense in 2015.

	financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
	and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles, and that receipts and expenditures of are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
	disposition of any of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
	evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	On July&nbsp;29, 2013, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to US$100 million of our
	outstanding American depositary shares, or ADSs, over a two-year period from July&nbsp;27, 2013 to July&nbsp;26, 2015. The ADSs may be purchased from time to time at management&#146;s discretion at prevailing market prices in the open market in
	accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Changyou&#146;s management will determine the timing and amount of any purchases of Changyou ADSs based on their evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of our ADSs
	and other factors. The purchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of July 26, 2015, we had repurchased an aggregate of 1,364,846 ADSs, representing 2,729,692 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $35
	million (equivalent to an average price of $25.90 per ADS, or $12.95 per Class&nbsp;A ordinary share). All ADSs repurchased by us during 2015, 2014 and 2013 were made pursuant to our publicly announced share repurchase program. We financed the share
	repurchase program through U.S. dollar-denominated loans from offshore banks which are secured by an equivalent amount of RMB-denominated onshore bank deposits of our subsidiaries in China.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To Board of Directors and Shareholders of Changyou.Com Limited:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of
	shareholders&#146; equity and consolidated statements of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Changyou.com Limited (the &#147;Company&#148;) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014,
	and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
	maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in
<I>
	Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework
</I>
	(
<I>
	2013
</I>
	) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
	Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
	control over financial reporting, included in management&#146;s annual report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under Item 15 of the accompanying Form 20-F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
	and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
	that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
	audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
	evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
	testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
	provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
	assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting
	includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
	transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
	of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
	financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&nbsp;Also,
	projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	On May&nbsp;11, 2011, the Group, through its VIE Gamease, acquired 68.258% of the equity interests of Shenzhen 7Road Technology Co., Ltd., or
	Shenzhen 7Road, and began to consolidate Shenzhen 7Road&#146;s financial statements on June&nbsp;1, 2011. Effective June&nbsp;26, 2012, Shenzhen 7Road was reorganized into a Cayman Islands holding company structure (the &#147;7Road
	Reorganization&#148;) where Changyou held a direct ownership interest in 7Road through the Group&#146;s subsidiary Changyou HK Webgames and Shenzhen 7Road was a VIE of 7Road. As the reorganization did not result in any change in the ultimate
	beneficial ownership of Shenzhen 7Road&#146;s business, assets and results of operations, the Group&#146;s management believes that the reorganization should be viewed as a non-substantive transaction and treated as if it had been effective upon the

	Under contractual arrangements with the Company&#146;s VIEs, the Company has the power to direct activities of

	It is
	possible that the Group&#146;s operation of certain of its operations and businesses through VIEs could be found by PRC authorities to be in violation of PRC law and regulations prohibiting or restricting foreign ownership of companies that engage
	in such operations and businesses. While the Group&#146;s management considers the possibility of such a finding by PRC regulatory authorities under current law and regulations to be remote, on January&nbsp;19, 2015, the Ministry of Commerce of the
	PRC, or (the &#147;MOFCOM&#148;) released on its Website for public comment a proposed PRC law (the &#147;Draft FIE Law&#148;) that appears to include VIEs within the scope of entities that could be considered to be foreign invested enterprises (or
	&#147;FIEs&#148;) that would be subject to restrictions under existing PRC law on foreign investment in certain categories of industry. Specifically, the Draft FIE Law introduces the concept of &#147;actual control&#148; for determining whether an
	entity is considered to be an FIE. In addition to control through direct or indirect ownership or equity, the Draft FIE Law includes control through contractual arrangements within the definition of &#147;actual control.&#148; If the Draft FIE Law
	is passed by the People&#146;s Congress of the PRC and goes into effect in its current form, these provisions regarding control through contractual arrangements could be construed to reach the Group&#146;s VIE arrangements, and as a result the
	Group&#146;s VIEs could become explicitly subject to the current restrictions on foreign investment in certain categories of industry. The Draft FIE Law includes provisions that would exempt from the definition of foreign invested enterprises
	entities where the ultimate controlling shareholders are either entities organized under PRC law or individuals who are PRC citizens. The Draft FIE Law does not make clear how &#147;control&#148; would be determined for such purpose, and is silent
	as to what type of enforcement action might be taken against existing VIEs that operate in restricted industries and are not controlled by entities organized under PRC law or individuals who are PRC citizens. If a finding were made by PRC
	authorities, under existing law and regulations or under the Draft FIE Law if it becomes effective, that the Group&#146;s operation of certain of its operations and businesses through VIEs, regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the licensing
	and operation of such operations and businesses would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including levying fines, confiscating the Group&#146;s income, revoking the business or operating licenses of the affected businesses,
	requiring the Group to restructure its ownership structure or operations, or requiring the Group to discontinue all or any portion of its operations. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to the Group&#146;s business operations,
	and have a severe adverse impact on the Group&#146;s cash flows, financial position and operating performance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, it is
	possible that the contracts among the Group, the Group&#146;s VIEs and shareholders of its VIEs would not be enforceable in China if PRC government authorities or courts were to find that such contracts contravene PRC law and regulations or are
	otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons. In the event that the Group was unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, the Group would not be able to exert effective control over the affected VIEs. Consequently, such VIE&#146;s
	results of operations, assets and liabilities would not be included in the Group&#146;s consolidated financial statements. If such were the case, the Group&#146;s cash flows, financial position and operating performance would be severely adversely
	affected. The Group&#146;s contractual arrangements with respect to its consolidated VIEs are approved and in place. The Group&#146;s management believes that such contracts are enforceable, and considers the possibility remote that PRC regulatory
	authorities with jurisdiction over the Group&#146;s operations and contractual relationships would find the contracts to be unenforceable.

	The Group&#146;s operations and businesses rely on the operations and businesses of its principal VIEs, which hold certain recognized and
	unrecognized revenue-producing assets. The recognized revenue-producing assets include goodwill and intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions. Goodwill primarily represents the expected synergies from combining an acquired business
	with the Group. Intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions mainly consist of customer relationships, non-compete agreements, user bases, copyrights, trademarks and developed technologies. Unrecognized revenue-producing assets mainly
	consist of licenses and intellectual property. Licenses include operations licenses, such as Internet information service licenses and licenses for providing content. Intellectual property developed by the Group mainly consists of patents,
	copyrights, trademarks, and domain names. The Group&#146;s operations and businesses may be adversely impacted if the Group loses the ability to use and enjoy assets held by these VIEs.

	The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the

	revised guidance on &#147;Testing of Goodwill for Impairment,&#148; a company first has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
	amount. For those reporting units where it was determined that it was more likely than not that their fair values were less than the units&#146; carrying amounts, the Group performed the first step of a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment
	test. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the reporting units were higher than their fair values, the Group performed the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.

	If the Company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is

	a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each
	reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially

	The carrying amounts of long-lived assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
	circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be
	generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported
	at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company tests impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets at the reporting unit level when impairment indicator appeared and recognizes impairment in the event that
	the carrying value exceeds the fair value of each reporting unit.

	higher of (i)&nbsp;and (ii). On May&nbsp;1, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the ordinary shares of 7Road held by the non-controlling shareholders and all of the equity interests in Shenzhen 7Road held by shareholders
	other than Gamease. The acquisition closed on June&nbsp;5, 2013. Under ASC&nbsp;810-10, changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest while the parent retains control of its subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions, and do not impact net
	income or comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements. Following the closing of the acquisition, $2.4 million, representing the excess of the amount of the mezzanine-classified non-controlling interest in 7Road over the purchase

	fix the advertising services to be provided and the prices for the services. Based on the contracts, the Group provides advertisement placements on the 17173.com Website in different forms, including text, rich media and video advertisements.

	To determine the method of recognition of online advertising revenues, prior to entering into contracts, management makes a credit assessment
	of customers to assess the collectability of amounts due under the contracts. For those contracts for which collectability is determined to be reasonably assured, revenues are recognized ratably over the period during which the advertising services
	are provided and when all revenue-recognition criteria have been met. For those contracts for which collectability is determined to be not reasonably assured, revenues are recognized only when the cash is received and all other revenue-recognition
	criteria have been met.

	The Group treats advertising contracts for the 17173.com Website with multiple deliverable elements as separate
	units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and recognizes revenues on a regular basis during the contract periods when each deliverable service is provided. Since the contract price is for all the deliverables under one advertising
	contract, the Group allocates the contract price among all the deliverables at the inception of the arrangement on the basis of their relative selling prices according to the selling price hierarchy established by ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. The Group
	first uses vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if it exists. If vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price does not exist, the Group uses third-party evidence of selling price. If neither vendor-specific objective evidence
	of selling price nor third-party evidence of selling price exists, the Group uses management&#146;s best estimate of the selling price for the deliverables.

	On May 28, 2014, the FASB and IASB issued their long-awaited converged standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.
	The standard is intended to improve the financial reporting of revenue and improve comparability of the top line in financial statements globally. The FASB is amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creating a new Topic 606, Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers, to supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. Additionally, the amendments supersede some
	cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition &#151; Construction &#151; Type and Production &#151; Type Contracts. For a public business entity, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,

	In February 2015, the FASB issued Consolidation (Topic 810) &#151;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The amendments in Topic 810
	respond to stakeholders&#146; concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities, by changing aspects of the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate such entities.
	Under the amendments, all reporting entities are within the scope of Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation&#151;Overall, including limited partnerships and similar legal entities, unless a scope exception applies. The amendments are intended to be an
	improvement to current U.S. GAAP, as they simplify the codification of FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), with changes including reducing the number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite
	deferral of Statement 167 and placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments are effective for publicly-traded companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim
	periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance.

	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which eliminates the

	effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early

	The agreement for the acquisition of Shenzhen 7Road included a contingent consideration

	the income approach applied. There were no indemnification assets involved. As of the end of 2012, 7Road had exceeded the financial performance milestones and as a result changes in fair value of the contingent consideration of $2.2&nbsp;million
	were recognized in other expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012. Total identifiable intangible assets acquired upon acquisition mainly included completed game, games under development and other identifiable intangible assets acquired,

	Since Doyo was primarily engaged in online advertising and traffic monetization businesses, which had economic
	characteristics similar to those of the 17173.com Website, Doyo was aggregated into the business associated with the 17173.com Website as a reporting unit of the platform channel segment and the excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets,
	identifiable intangible assets (mainly user base and domain names) acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill relating to the business associated with the 17173.com Website. The acquired identifiable intangible assets were valued by
	various approaches, including the income&nbsp;approach, as appropriate. Total goodwill of $7.6&nbsp;million primarily represented the expected synergies from combining operations of the Company and Doyo, which management considered to be
	complementary to each other. In accordance with ASC350, goodwill was not amortized but was tested for impairment and was not deductible for tax purposes.

	Changyou&#146;s management reviewed the achievement of performance milestones for Doyo as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014. Doyo&#146;s performance had exceeded the milestone established for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, and considering the operations of Doyo as at December&nbsp;31, 2014, management determined that there was a higher
	probability of Doyo&#146;s achieving the milestone established for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 than that there was at the time of the acquisition. As a result, the Company recorded a change in fair value of the contingent consideration of

	In September 2015, Changyou&#146;s VIE Guanyou Gamespace entered into an agreement to sell all of the equity interests of Doyo to a PRC
	company owned by the former members of the management of Doyo. The aggregate consideration contemplated by the agreement includes cash consideration of approximately $2.9 million, and forgiveness, effective upon the completion of the sale, of
	contingent consideration payable to former members of the management of Doyo in the amount of $6.0 million. Changyou&#146;s management treated the fact that the total consideration for the sale of Doyo pursuant to the agreement was lower than the
	carrying value of Doyo&#146;s net assets as an indicator that the goodwill associated with Doyo might be impaired. Accordingly, in September 2015 management performed a goodwill impairment test and recognized goodwill impairment in the amount of
	$1.9 million and there was no further gain or loss recognized in other income in the Group&#146;s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The transaction was completed on October 27, 2015.

	The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets acquired (consisting
	primarily of software technology and a domain name) and liabilities assumed was initially recorded as goodwill relating to the Online Game segment. The acquired identifiable intangible assets were valued using the income&nbsp;approach. Total
	goodwill of $33.7&nbsp;million primarily represented synergies between the Company&#146;s existing online game business and RaidCall that were expected to result from an enhancement of game players&#146; experience through the Company&#146;s
	offering of the RaidCall communications tool with the Company&#146;s online games. In December 2014, Changyou&#146;s management concluded that RaidCall was unable to provide the expected synergies with Changyou&#146;s online games business.
	Accordingly, goodwill impairment and impairment of acquired intangible assets of $33.8&nbsp;million and $15.3&nbsp;million, respectively, were charged for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Beginning in 2014, the operations of RaidCall were
	reclassified from the Online Game segment to the Platform Channel Business segment, due to a change in the CODMs review of the operating segment.

	The acquired identifiable intangible assets represent the Dolphin Browser user base, technology and trademark,
	the useful lives of which were 2.4&nbsp;years, 5.4&nbsp;years and 10.4&nbsp;years, respectively. The acquired user base was valued using the cost saving approach, and the acquired technology and trademark were valued using the income approach.
	Goodwill of $113&nbsp;million was recognized at the time of the Company&#146;s acquisition of MoboTap.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In accordance with ASC&nbsp;350,
	goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment and is not deductible for tax purposes. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the financial performance of MoboTap was below original expectations, and Changyou&#146;s management concluded that
	the Dolphin Browser was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyou&#146;s platform channel business, and accordingly performed a goodwill impairment test using the net present value method for the goodwill generated in the acquisition of
	MoboTap. As a result, Changyou recorded $29.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively, in goodwill and intangible assets impairment losses.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on an assessment of MoboTap&#146;s financial performance conducted in connection with the acquisition, MoboTap was not considered
	material to the Group. Thus the Group&#146;s management concluded that the presentation of pro forma financial information with respect to the results of operations of the Group including the acquired MoboTap was not necessary.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The operating results of MoboTap, which are not significant to the Group, have been included in the consolidated financial statements since
	the acquisition date. The Dolphin Browser serves as a gateway to a host of user activities on mobile devices, which contributes to the Group&#146;s Platform Channel Business. Accordingly, MoboTap was reported in 2014 and 2015 under the Platform
	Channel Business segment.

	Beginning in 2012, Changyou drew down loans from offshore branches of certain banks for the purposes of expediting the
	payment of a special one-time cash dividend to its shareholders, providing working capital to support its overseas operations, and funding the Company&#146;s acquisitions and the Company&#146;s share repurchase program. These bank loans were secured
	by an equivalent or greater amount of RMB deposits by Changyou in the onshore branches of such banks. The loans from the offshore branches of the lending banks are classified as short-term bank loans or long-term bank loans based on their payment
	terms.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the total amount of the bank loans was $344.5&nbsp;million, all of which carried a floating rate of
	interest based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;). For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, interest income from the restricted time deposits securing the loans was $16.3&nbsp;million and $12.8&nbsp;million,
	respectively, and interest expense on the bank loans was $6.4&nbsp;million and $7.1&nbsp;million, respectively.

	Changyou entered into investment agreements with seven mobile game development companies and one mobile product development company to acquire
	10% to 30% of the equity interests in those companies, with aggregate initial consideration of $4.0&nbsp;million. These investments were accounted under the equity method, because Changyou can exercise significant influence over the companies
	through rights to appoint one director to the board of each of the investee companies but does not own a majority of the equity interests in or control the companies. During 2015, the Company recognized impairment losses of $1.2&nbsp;million in the
	aggregate for equity investments in four mobile game development companies, due to the companies&#146; disappointing financial results. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 the carrying amount of these equity method investments was $1.6 million and
	$2.9&nbsp;million, respectively, reflecting the Company&#146;s proportionate share of the equity of these companies, and the Company recognized a gain of $1,300 and a loss of $0.2 million, respectively, in other income in the consolidated statements
	of comprehensive income in 2015 and 2014.

	In 2015, Changyou made an initial investment of $3&nbsp;million in return for a limited partner
	interest in an incubator fund. Changyou does not have a significant influence over the fund, which has no readily determinable fair value, and accounted for the investment using the cost method.

	Investment in debt securities represents the convertible note of a foreign game developer that the Group purchased on July&nbsp;10, 2014. The
	cost of the investment was approximately $1.95&nbsp;million. As a result of the issuer&#146;s disappointing financial results, the Group sold the convertible note back to the issuer for an amount lower than the original principal amount of the note.
	As a result, the Company recognized a loss of $1.4 million during 2015.

	Prior to August 17, 2015, there were two reporting units with goodwill under the Online Game segment,
	consisting of the Changyou online game business and the 7Road online game business. After the sale of Shenzhen 7Road on August 17, 2015, the Changyou online game business was the only reporting unit with goodwill under the Online Game segment. There
	were three reporting units with goodwill under the Platform Channel segment in 2015, consisting of the 17173.com Website, RaidCall and MoboTap. The only reporting unit under the Others segment, and therefore the only reporting unit with goodwill,
	was the cinema advertising business. The Group tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of October&nbsp;1, 2015.

	For impairment tests performed for the reporting units, the Group first qualitatively assessed
	whether it was more likely than not that their fair values were less than their carrying amounts. In performing the assessment, the Group took into consideration all of the events and circumstances listed in ASC&nbsp;350, in addition to other
	entity-specific factors. For those reporting units where it was determined that it was more likely than not that their fair values were less than the units&#146; carrying amounts, the Group performed the first step of a two-step quantitative
	goodwill impairment test. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the reporting units were higher than their fair values, the Group performed the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Group
	assigned the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. For the two-step goodwill impairment test, the Group estimated the fair values with the income approach,
	and considered factors that included expected future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates.

	In 2014, as Changyou&#146;s management
	concluded that RaidCall was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyou&#146;s online game business, Changyou performed a two-step goodwill impairment test for the goodwill generated in the acquisition of RaidCall. As a result of this
	analysis, Changyou recorded a $33.8&nbsp;million goodwill impairment loss.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2015, as the financial performance of MoboTap is below
	original expectations and Changyou&#146;s management concluded that the Dolphin Browser was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyou&#146;s platform channel business, Changyou performed a two-step goodwill impairment test for the goodwill
	generated in the acquisition of MoboTap. As a result, Changyou recorded $29.6 million in goodwill impairment losses for goodwill associated with the acquisition of MoboTap. The goodwill impairment losses are included in the Group&#146;s statements
	of comprehensive income under &#147;goodwill impairment and impairment of intangibles as part of acquisition of a business.&#148; In September 2015, Changyou&#146;s VIE Guanyou Gamespace entered into an agreement to sell all of the equity interests
	of Doyo to a PRC company owned by the former members of the management of Doyo. Changyou&#146;s management considered the fact that the total consideration for the sale of Doyo pursuant to the agreement would be lower than the carrying value of
	Doyo&#146;s net assets to be an indicator that the goodwill associated with Doyo might be impaired. Accordingly, in September 2015 management performed a goodwill impairment test and the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge in the amount
	of $1.9 million. The $114.7 million of goodwill associated with the Company&#146;s previous acquisitions of 7Road and Doyo were de-recognized as a result of the Company&#146;s dispositions of Shenzhen 7Road and Doyo in 2015. The fair values of the
	other reporting units exceeded their carrying values, indicating that the goodwill of those reporting units was not impaired.

	The Company&#146;s cash equivalents mainly consist of time deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.
	The fair values of cash equivalents are determined based on the pervasive interest rates in the market. The Company classifies the valuation techniques that use the pervasive interest rates input as Level&nbsp;2 of fair value measurements. Generally
	there are no quoted prices in active markets for identical cash equivalents at the reporting date. In order to determine the fair value, the Company must use the discounted cash flow method and observable inputs other than quoted prices in active
	markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
	the assets or liabilities.

	$174.5&nbsp;million, respectively. The financial instruments are issued by commercial banks in China with a variable interest rate indexed to the performance of underlying assets. Since the maturity dates of these financial instruments are within
	one year, the investments are classified as short-term investments. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Company recorded changes in the fair value of short-term investments in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
	income of $2.5&nbsp;million, $3.1&nbsp;million and $9.4 million, respectively.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Through December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had contractually granted under the 2014 Share Incentive Plan an aggregate of 2,416,000
	Class&nbsp;A restricted share units (settleable upon vesting in Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares) to certain employees. On February&nbsp;16, 2015, Changyou&#146;s Board of Directors approved the conversion of 2,400,000 Class&nbsp;A restricted share
	units into options for the purchase of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares at an exercise price of $0.01. The conversion constituted a modification of share based compensation. The incremental value of the modification is approximately zero due to the
	facts that the exercise price is approximately zero and the other terms were not changed. On June&nbsp;1, 2015, Changyou&#146;s Board of Directors approved the grants of options for the purchase of an aggregate of 1,998,000 Class&nbsp;A ordinary
	shares to certain members of the Company&#146;s management and certain other employees, at an exercise price of $0.01. The options into which the Class A restricted units were converted on February 16, 2015 and the options approved on June 1, 2015
	provide for vesting in four equal installments over a period of four years, with each installment vesting upon satisfaction of a service period requirement and the achievement of certain subjective performance targets. No grant date had been
	established for the unvested options for accounting purposes as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, because a mutual understanding had not been reached between Changyou and the recipients clarifying the subjective performance requirements. Compensation
	expense for the options is accrued commencing on the service inception date and was, and will be, re-measured based on the then-current fair value of the options on each subsequent reporting date until the grant date is established. To determine the
	fair value of these share options, the public market price of Changyou&#146;s ADSs at each reporting date was used and a binomial valuation model was applied.

	During 2015, 450,000 share options were vested. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, there were 450,000 share options that were vested and remained

	On October&nbsp;27, 2009, the PRC State Administration of Taxation issued Circular 601, which

	non-beneficial owner for purpose of the China-HK Tax Arrangement, any dividends paid to it by any of the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries would not qualify for the preferential dividend withholding tax rate of 5%, but rather would be subject to the
	statutory withholding tax rate of 10%. In order to fund the distribution of a dividend to the Company&#146;s shareholders, the Company&#146;s management determined to cause one of the Group&#146;s PRC subsidiaries to declare and distribute a cash
	dividend of all of its stand-alone 2012 earnings and half of its stand-alone subsequent years&#146; earnings to its direct overseas parent company, Changyou HK. The Company does not intend to cause any of its PRC subsidiaries to distribute any
	profits of such subsidiaries with respect to years prior to 2012 to their direct overseas parent companies, but rather intends that such profits will be retained by such subsidiaries for their PRC operations. The Company&#146;s management believes
	that under the corporate income tax law and relevant rules, such dividend out of earnings generated after January&nbsp;1, 2012 is subject to a 5% withholding tax. Therefore, a withholding tax obligation of the PRC subsidiary associated with this

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, the Group has made a valuation allowance against its deferred tax
	assets to the extent such deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries and VIEs. The Group evaluated a variety of factors in determining the amount of the valuation allowance, including uncertainty as to the success of
	the Group&#146;s businesses due to intense competition in the industries in which the Group operates its businesses and the migration of game players to mobile devices.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December 31, 2015, the Group had net operating losses from PRC entities of approximately $110.9 million available to offset against
	future net profit for income tax purposes. The Group anticipates that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses (except for the net operating losses generated by Gamease and Guanyou Gamespace) may not be utilized based on its
	estimate of the operation performance of these PRC entities; therefore, $13.6 million in deferred tax assets generated from net operating losses were offset by a valuation allowance. These net operating losses are expected to expire during the
	period between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2021.

	The Company&#146;s subsidiaries and VIEs in the PRC participate in a government-mandated multi-employer defined contribution
	plan pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor regulations require the Company&#146;s subsidiaries and VIEs in the PRC to pay to the local labor bureau a monthly contribution at
	a stated contribution rate based on the monthly compensation of qualified employees. The relevant local labor bureau is responsible for meeting all retirement benefit obligations; the Group has no further commitments beyond its monthly contribution.
	During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Group contributed approximately a total of $30.1&nbsp;million, $47.0&nbsp;million and $36.3&nbsp;million, respectively, to these funds.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group currently has two reportable segments consisting of the Online Game segment and the Platform Channel segment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company determined that as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 the business segments that constituted its then primary reportable segments were the
	Online Game segment, which consisted of PC games, and the 17173 Business segment, which consisted of the online advertising business and the IVAS business. In 2014, the Company expanded its online game business to include mobile games, and the CODMs
	determined that the operation of mobile games should be reviewed under the Online Game segment. In addition, the Group developed and acquired software applications for PCs and mobile devices intended to strengthen the Group&#146;s competitiveness in
	the Internet sector. In 2014, the Group launched the wan.com Website, which provided to game players a collection of Web games of third-party developers. The CODMs determined that the software applications for PCs and mobile services and the wan.com
	Website should be reviewed together as one operating segment identified as the software segment. Due to the similarity of the economic characteristics of the operations of the software applications and the wan.com Website included in the software
	segment to those of the 17173.com Website, the software segment was aggregated with the existing 17173.com segment under the Platform Channel segment. Cinema advertising was not deemed significant enough to qualify as a separate, reportable segment
	and therefore was included in &#147;Others.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Beginning in 2014, the Company stopped preparing discrete asset and liability
	information for individual operating segments, since the CODMs did not use balance sheet information for purposes of allocating resources to or evaluating the performance of the operating segments. Moreover, the CODMs began to review separate
	financial information of the software segment, which was reported within the Platform Channel segment in 2014. Promotion expenses for software in the amount of $42.5&nbsp;million, which were recognized under the Online Game segment in 2013, were
	reclassified into the Platform Channel segment to conform to the 2014 presentation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group ceased operating the wan.com Website on
	March, 2015. As a result, thereafter IVAS aggregated with 17173.com segment in the Platform Channel segment consisted solely of software for PCs and mobile devices. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the business segments that constituted the
	Company&#146;s primary reportable segments were the Online Game segment, which consists of PC games ,mobile games and Web games, and the Platform Channel segment, which consists primarily of online advertising services on the 17173.com Website, and
	a relatively small amount of IVAS. Cinema advertising is not deemed significant enough to qualify as a separate, reportable segment and therefore is included in &#147;Others.&#148;

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Relevant PRC law and regulations permit payment of dividends by PRC-based operating entities such as AmazGame, Gamease,
	Gamespace and Guanyou Gamespace only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a PRC-based operating entity is required to annually appropriate 10% of net
	after-tax income to the statutory surplus reserve fund (See Note&nbsp;23
<B>
</B>
	&#151; STATUTORY RESERVES) prior to payment of any dividends, unless such reserve funds have reached 50% of the entity&#146;s registered capital. As a result of these
	and other restrictions under PRC law and regulations, PRC-based operating entities are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company either in the form of dividends, loans or advances. Even though the Company
	currently does not require any such dividends, loans or advances from PRC-based operating entities for working capital and other funding purposes, the Company may in the future require additional cash resources from PRC-based operating entities due
	to changes in business conditions, to fund future acquisitions and development, or to declare and pay dividends to or distribution to its shareholders.
