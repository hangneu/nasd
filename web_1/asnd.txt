	We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company applying our TransCon technology to develop
	long-acting prodrug therapies with several product candidates in clinical and preclinical development. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. To date, we have focused
	substantially all of our efforts on our research and development activities and, in particular, developing our lead product candidate, TransCon hGH, and our proprietary TransCon technology. We have only a limited operating history upon which our
	shareholders and ADS holders can evaluate our business and prospects. Our revenue has been primarily generated through collaboration agreements under which we have received up-front technology licensing fees, payments for the sale of certain
	intellectual property rights and payments we receive for services rendered to our collaboration partners and other biopharmaceutical companies. Revenue generated from existing or new collaborations may fluctuate significantly over time. Accordingly,
	going forward, we may incur significant losses from our operations. We had a net loss of &#128;32.9&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and a net loss of &#128;9.7&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Our
	total equity was &#128;120.3&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 compared to &#128;45.8&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. Neither the net loss nor net profit we have experienced in prior years are necessarily indicative of our future
	results.

	None of our product candidates have been approved for commercial sale by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, the U.S. Food
	and Drug Administration, or FDA, or similar non-U.S. regulatory authorities, and we have not generated revenues from the sale of approved products. We expect that our annual operating expenses may increase over the next several years as we expand
	our research and development, product discovery and development efforts and operate as a public company. Even if we receive milestone payments from our current or future collaboration partners, we may incur substantial operating losses for the
	foreseeable future as we execute our operating plan. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we will receive any potential milestones under our agreements with our collaboration partners. For a discussion of the risks associated with our preclinical
	and clinical development programs with, and potential for milestone and other payments from, our collaboration partners, see &#147;&#151;Risks Related to Our Business.&#148;

	Even if we receive milestone payments or royalty payments from our current or future collaboration partners, we may not be able to achieve or

	revenue recognition of such payments over time, and depending upon such requirements and the period of recognition, we may still incur losses even after the receipt of

	In cases where we, or our current or
	future collaboration partners, are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which regulatory approval is
	granted, the accepted price for the product, the ability to get reimbursement for our products at any price and the extent of our royalty rights for that territory. If the number of patients suitable for our product candidates is not as significant
	as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice, treatment guidelines or third-party payor restrictions, we
	may not generate significant revenue from the sale of such products, even if approved. Our failure to generate revenue from product sales or pursuant to up-front or milestone payments and royalties from current and future collaboration partners

	Since our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated to our research and development activities and, in particular, developing our
	proprietary TransCon technology and our most advanced product candidates. In February 2015, we received $111.5&nbsp;million (&#128;101.4 million) in net proceeds from our initial public offering after deducting the underwriting commission and
	offering expenses payable by us and as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of &#128;119.6 million. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future, including costs associated with
	research and development, conducting preclinical studies, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and, eventually, sales and marketing if any of our product candidates is approved. Because the outcome of any clinical trial and/or regulatory

	Additionally, our clinical

	Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we, or our current or future
	collaboration partners, must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain.
	Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process; the results of preclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, the positive results
	generated to date in preclinical and clinical studies for TransCon hGH do not ensure that the planned Phase 3 clinical trial, or other clinical trials, will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail
	to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks
	in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the
	results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or to be able to use an expedited regulatory pathway for approval of our product candidates.

	Further, we are planning to conduct our Phase 3 pediatric study of TransCon hGH across many clinical sites globally, including sites located

	adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such
	foreign countries. In addition, the EMA or the FDA may determine that the clinical trial results obtained in foreign subjects do not represent the safety and efficacy of a product candidate when administered in EEA or U.S. patients, and are thus not
	supportive of an application for a marketing authorization in the EEA or of an NDA approval in the United States. As a result, the EMA or the FDA may not accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the EEA or the United States, respectively,
	and may require that we conduct additional clinical trials or obtain additional data before we can proceed with filing an NDA in the United States or a marketing authorization application in the EEA. The EMA or the FDA may even require conducting

	A key element of our strategy is to expand our pipeline of product candidates utilizing our proprietary TransCon technology, and to advance
	such product candidates through clinical development, either on our own or in conjunction with strategic collaboration partners. Other than TransCon hGH and TransCon Treprostinil, our current unlicensed product candidates are in various stages of
	preclinical development, and will require substantial preclinical and clinical development and testing, and eventually regulatory approval, prior to commercialization. TransCon hGH is our only unlicensed product candidate currently in active
	clinical development. TransCon Treprostinil has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and is currently undergoing additional preclinical evaluation by us. Our other unlicensed product candidates are in preclinical development and may require
	significant time and additional research and development before we can file a Clinical Trial Application or IND with regulatory authorities to begin clinical studies. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage of such drugs
	successfully complete the EMA or FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to continue to fund such development programs, our product candidates may not be advanced to clinical studies or be
	successfully developed or commercialized. In addition, our preclinical product candidates may not demonstrate the advantages we expect from application of our TransCon technology in preclinical studies. In such event, we may decide not to progress

	regulatory approval process may take significant time and resources and require deliverables from independent third&nbsp;parties not under our control. For some of our product candidates, the regulatory approval path and requirements may not be

	It is generally

	with certain specified coverage limits. We cannot be certain that the insurance policies will be sufficient to cover all claims that may be made against us. Our inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable
	cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of any products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering use in our clinical trials in the
	amount of $8&nbsp;million in the aggregate. Any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our
	insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various, limits, exclusions and deductibles, and given these various limits, exclusions and deductibles, we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have
	to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the

	We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. If we fail to remediate these
	weaknesses and maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors&#146; views
	of us and could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ADSs.

	In accordance with Section&nbsp;404, management assessed
	the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and based on our management&#146;s assessment using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
	Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. However, management identified two control deficiencies that constitute material
	weaknesses. Firstly, a material error in research and development costs for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was identified and corrected. Due to a material weakness in the design of our controls related to the recognition of costs for
	deliverables under our supplier agreements, research and development costs were overstated by an amount that should have been recognized in the following financial year. Secondly, we commenced but did not complete the design and implementation of
	adequate internal controls relating to entity-level controls, controls over financial reporting and controls over our IT applications.

	We
	have developed and begun implementing a remediation plan for these material weaknesses and despite our expectations regarding our remediation plan, our remediation plan may not be effective to fully remediate the internal control weaknesses. We
	cannot assure that you our remediation efforts will be successful or that similar material weaknesses will not recur, nor that we will able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in
	accordance with Section&nbsp;404. If we cannot in the future favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected, which could
	have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our ADSs.

	Due to the international scope of our operations, fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the euro, the Danish krone and the U.S.
	dollar, may adversely affect us. Although we are based in Denmark, we source research and development, manufacturing, consulting and other services from several countries. In addition, our arrangements with our collaboration partners are denominated
	in euros and U.S. dollars. Further, potential future revenue may be derived from abroad, including from the United States. We currently attempt to limit our exposure to exchange rate risks by maintaining cash positions in the currencies in which we
	expect to incur the majority of our future expenses; however, for a variety of reasons we may be unable to maintain cash positions in the currencies in which we expect to incur the majority of our future expenses and we may fail to predict the
	currency of our future expenses, accurately or at all. As a result, our business and the price of the ADSs may be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the euro and these other currencies, which may also have a significant
	impact on our reported results of operations and cash flows from period to period. We currently do not enter into foreign exchange contracts to cover our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, or any other form of exchange rate hedging
	arrangements. If we fail to manage foreign exchange risk adequately our business, results of operations and prospects, and the value of our shares or ADSs may be adversely affected.

	In addition, the possible abandonment of the euro by one or more members of the European Union could harm our business in the future. Despite
	measures taken by the European Union to provide funding to certain E.U. member states in financial difficulties and by a number of European countries to stabilize their economies and reduce their debt burdens, it is possible that the euro could be
	abandoned in the future as a currency by countries that have adopted its use. This could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more E.U. member states. The effects on our business of a potential dissolution of the European
	Union, the exit of one or more E.U. member states from the European Union or the abandonment of the euro as a currency, are impossible to predict with certainty, and any such events could harm our business, financial condition and results of

	The availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health
	insurers and other third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments such as ours, assuming approval. Our ability to achieve acceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement for drug treatments by governmental
	authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize, and attract additional collaboration partners to invest in the development of our product candidates. We cannot be sure
	that coverage and reimbursement in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will be available for any product that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future. Third-party
	payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products, medical devices and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement for particular drugs when an equivalent generic drug is
	available. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider our product candidate and the generic parent drug as substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the generic drug. Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience
	of administration with our product candidate, pricing of the existing parent drug may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our product candidate. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able
	to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on products that we may develop.

	There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States,
	third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs, biologics and medical devices will be covered. The Medicare and Medicaid
	programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs, biologics and medical devices. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors
	will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.

	Outside the United States, international

	pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own
	prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets

	We depend on third parties to manufacture products employing our technology. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for

	of hazardous materials, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and manufacturers and suppliers with whom we may contract are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage,
	handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers&#146; facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the
	risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and
	liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. We cannot guarantee that the safety procedures utilized by third-party manufacturers and suppliers
	with whom we may contract will comply with the standards prescribed by laws and regulations or will eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and
	such liability could exceed our resources and European, U.S. federal and state or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are
	complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage. In the

	conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the E.U. Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
	Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug
	in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. An E.U. orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of
	market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to
	justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review

	Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of
	our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or
	the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other
	things, amends the intent requirement of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition,
	the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims

	industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may affect demand for any products that we may develop and could harm our sales and profitability. For example, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010 with a goal of
	reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the

	The patent application process, also known as patent prosecution, is expensive and time-consuming, and we and our current or future licensors

	fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, these and any of our patents and applications may not be
	prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example with

	any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and unenforceable. Any of these outcomes could

	The strength of patents in the biotechnology
	and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be highly uncertain. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other countries. Even if patents do
	issue on such patent applications, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, U.S. patents can be challenged by any
	person before the new USPTO Patent Trial and Appeals Board at any time within the one-year period following that person&#146;s receipt of an allegation of infringement of the patents. Patents granted by the European Patent Office may be similarly
	opposed by any person within nine months from the publication of the grant. Similar proceedings are available in other jurisdictions, and in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions third parties can raise questions of validity with a
	patent office even before a patent has granted. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. For example, a
	third party may develop a competitive product that provides therapeutic benefits similar to one or more of our product candidates but that has a different composition that falls outside the scope of our patent protection. If the breadth or strength
	of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is successfully challenged, then our ability to commercialize such product candidates could be negatively affected, and we may
	face unexpected competition that could have harm our business. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we or our collaboration partners could market our product candidates under patent protection would
	be reduced.

	Even where laws provide
	protection, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain. If we or one of our collaboration partners were to initiate
	legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering the product candidate, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging
	invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Patents may be unenforceable if
	someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcomes of proceedings involving assertions of invalidity and unenforceability are unpredictable.
	It is possible that prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution exists, which would render our patents invalid. Moreover, it is also possible that prior art may exist that we are aware of, but that we do not believe
	are relevant to our current or future patents, that could nevertheless be determined to render our patents invalid. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability of our patents covering one of our product
	candidates, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection would harm our business. Moreover, our competitors could counterclaim in any suit to enforce our patents
	that we infringe their intellectual property. Furthermore, some of our competitors have substantially greater intellectual property portfolios, and resources, than we do.

	Our commercial success depends significantly on
	our ability to operate without infringing, violating or misappropriating the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Our own technologies may infringe, violate or misappropriate the patents or other proprietary rights of third
	parties, or we may be subject to third-party claims of such infringement. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. We
	cannot be certain that our product candidates will not infringe existing or future patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18&nbsp;months or more after filing, and because pending patent claims
	can be revised before issuance, there may be applications now pending which may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or our TransCon technology. We may not be aware of patents
	that have already issued that a third party might assert are infringed by our product candidates. It is also possible that patents of which we are aware, but which we do not believe are relevant to our product candidates, could nevertheless be found
	to be infringed by our product candidates. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any valid issued patents that we believe would prevent us from marketing our product candidates, if approved. Moreover, we may face patent infringement claims from
	non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect.

	In addition, we and our collaboration partners may face costly and time-consuming intellectual property litigation with the NDA holders and
	Orange Book patentees of the products in respect of which we seek to obtain FDA approval. Companies that produce branded pharmaceutical products for which there are listed patents in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book routinely bring patent infringement
	litigation against applicants seeking FDA approval to manufacture and market branded and/or generic forms of their products. Accordingly, we may face patent litigation as a result of our submission of NDA applications to the FDA or as a result of
	submitting an MAA with the EMA.

	Depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors, we and our collaboration
	partners may, in certain circumstances, including upon expiration of a potential 30-month automatic stay on the FDA&#146;s ability to grant final approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA, elect to market the relevant product candidate after FDA approval, even
	though litigation is still pending. This could occur before any court decision or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending. Should we and our collaboration partners elect to proceed in this manner, we could face substantial patent
	liability damages, including possible triple damages in the United States, if a final court decision is adverse to us. If we and our collaboration partners are unsuccessful in any such litigation, the court could issue a permanent injunction
	preventing us from marketing our product candidates for the life of the litigated patent(s). In addition, such patent litigation could last for years, potentially delaying the commercialization of our product candidates until expiration of the
	relevant patents. Regulatory approval of pharmaceutical products in Europe is not linked to patent rights and patent disputes as it is in the United States. However, patent litigation is more cumbersome in Europe because enforcement is on a
	country-by-country basis and there are a number of countries where the relevant patents may be in force.

	Intellectual property litigation
	involves many risks and uncertainties, and there is no assurance that we will prevail in any lawsuit brought against us. Third parties making claims against us for infringement, violation or misappropriation of their intellectual property rights may
	seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop
	or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, would be a substantial
	diversion of resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of any such infringement, violation or misappropriation, we may need to obtain licenses from such third parties and we and our collaboration partners may be prevented from
	pursuing product development or commercialization and/or may be required to pay damages. We cannot be certain that any licenses required under such patents or proprietary rights would be made available to us, or that any offer to license would be
	made available to us on commercially reasonable terms. If we cannot obtain such licenses, we and our collaboration partners may be restricted or prevented from manufacturing and selling products employing our technology. These adverse results, if
	they occur, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects, and the value of our shares or ADSs.

	Leahy-Smith Act, signed into law on September&nbsp;16, 2011, could increase those uncertainties and costs. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These
	include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. In addition, the Leahy-Smith Act has

	would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Denmark. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in Denmark, the party in whose favor a final and conclusive judgment of the U.S. court has been rendered will be required to file its
	claim with a court of competent jurisdiction in Denmark. Such party may submit to the Danish court the final judgment rendered by the U.S. court. If and to the extent that the Danish court finds that the jurisdiction of the U.S. court has been based
	on grounds which are internationally acceptable and that proper legal procedures have been observed, the Danish court should, in principle, give binding effect to the judgment of the U.S. court, unless such judgment contravenes principles of public

	they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in Denmark are solely governed by the provisions of the Danish Civil Procedure Code.

	As a foreign private issuer and as permitted by the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select

	We qualify as a foreign private issuer. As a result, in accordance with the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, we rely on
	home country governance requirements and certain exemptions thereunder rather than relying on the corporate governance requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select Market. For instance, the Listing Rules for the NASDAQ Stock Market, or the NASDAQ
	Listing Rules, for domestic U.S. issuers require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of their board members be independent, and to have independent director oversight of executive compensation, nomination of board members and
	corporate governance matters. As a foreign private issuer, however, while we intend to comply with these requirements, we are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the above requirements. Danish law does not require that a majority of
	our board consist of independent directors or the implementation of a remuneration committee or nominating and corporate governance committee, and our board may thus in the future not include, or include fewer, independent directors than would be
	required if we were subject to the NASDAQ Listing Rules, or they may decide that it is in our interest not to have a remuneration committee or nominating and corporate governance committee, or have such committees governed by practices that would
	not comply with NASDAQ Listing Rules. Since a majority of our board of directors may not consist of independent directors if we decide to rely on the foreign private issuer exemption to the NASDAQ Listing Rules, our board&#146;s approach may,
	therefore, be different from that of a board with a majority of independent directors, and as a result, the management oversight of our company could, in the future, be more limited than if we were subject to the NASDAQ Listing Rules. We intend to
	follow home country practice with regard to, among other things, quorum requirements generally applicable to general meetings of shareholders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, Danish law does not have a regulatory regime for the solicitation of proxies and the solicitation of proxies is not a generally
	accepted business practice in Denmark, thus our practice varies from the requirement of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5620(b). In addition, our shareholders have authorized our board of directors to issue securities including in connection with certain events
	such as the acquisition of shares or assets of another company, the establishment of or amendments to equity-based compensation plans for employees, a change of control of us, rights issues at or below market price, certain private placements and
	issuance of convertible notes. To this extent, our practice varies from the requirements of NASDAQ Rule 5635, which generally requires an issuer to obtain shareholder approval for the issuance of securities in connection with such events.
	Accordingly, our shareholders and holders of our ADS may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to these NASDAQ requirements.

	We qualify as a foreign private issuer and therefore we are not
	required to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. We may no longer be a foreign private issuer as of June&nbsp;30, 2016, which would require us to
	comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers as of January&nbsp;1, 2017. In order to maintain our current status as a foreign private issuer, either (a)&nbsp;a
	majority of our ordinary shares or ADSs must be either directly or indirectly owned of record by non-residents of the United States or (b)(i) a majority of our executive officers or directors may not be U.S. citizens or residents, (ii)&nbsp;more
	than 50% of our assets cannot be located in the United States and (iii)&nbsp;our business must not be administered principally inside the United States. If we lost this status, we would be required to comply with the Exchange Act reporting and other
	requirements applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, which are more detailed and extensive than the requirements for foreign private issuers. We may also be required to make changes in our corporate governance practices in accordance with various SEC
	and NASDAQ rules. The regulatory and compliance costs to us under U.S. securities laws if we are required to comply with the reporting requirements applicable to a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly higher than the cost we would incur as a
	foreign private issuer. As a result, we expect that a loss of foreign private issuer status would increase our legal and financial compliance costs and would make some activities highly time consuming and costly. We also expect that if we were
	required to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, it would make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or
	incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.

	for such year is passive income or (2)&nbsp;at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during such year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.
	Because the value of our assets for purposes of this determination will generally be determined by reference to the market price of the ADSs, our PFIC status will depend in large part on the market price of the ADSs, which may fluctuate
	significantly. In addition, changes in the composition of our income or assets may cause us to become a PFIC. A separate determination must be made each taxable year as to whether we are a PFIC (after the close of each such taxable year). If we are

	We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company applying our TransCon technology to develop a pipeline of long-acting prodrug therapies with
	best-in-class profiles to address large markets with significant unmet medical needs. We are developing our lead product candidate, TransCon human growth hormone, or TransCon hGH, for once-weekly administration to treat growth hormone deficiency, or
	GHD, and other indications. We have successfully completed Phase 2 studies of TransCon hGH in children and adults with GHD. In July 2015, we announced positive top-line results from a six-month Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
	once-weekly TransCon hGH in 53 treatment-na&iuml;ve, pre-pubertal children with GHD. Using our TransCon technology, we have established a new paradigm that combines the benefits of conventional prodrug and sustained release technologies, and is
	broadly applicable to proteins, peptides and small molecules. In addition to TransCon hGH, we have developed a pipeline of long-acting prodrug product candidates such as TransCon Treprostinil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or
	PAH, TransCon Peptides, for the treatment of diabetes, partnered with Sanofi, and TransCon Ranibizumab, in the field of ophthalmology, partnered with Genentech.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	GHD is a serious orphan disease that affects both children and adults. Children with GHD are characterized by short stature, metabolic
	abnormalities, cognitive deficiencies and poor quality of life. GHD in adults is associated with premature mortality, increased adiposity, or fat mass, as well as psychiatric-cognitive, cardiovascular, muscular, metabolic and skeletal abnormalities.
	Human growth hormone, or hGH, is used for the long-term treatment of children and adults that fail to secrete adequate amounts of endogenous growth hormone. According to Medtrack, global sales from currently marketed hGH products grew to over $3
	billion in 2014.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The use of recombinant hGH was introduced in 1981, and since then many of the world&#146;s largest pharmaceutical
	companies have developed and now market daily hGH injections as the current standard of care for the treatment of GHD. Despite the demonstrated benefits of hGH therapy, published studies have shown that the majority of patients on a daily hGH
	regimen are not fully compliant with their daily dosing schedule, which in pediatric patients has led to significant reductions in treatment outcomes. Since the 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry has employed various approaches to develop
	long-acting growth hormone products to reduce the patient burden of daily injections and increase patient compliance with the dosing regimen. To date, regulatory authorities have approved only two long-acting growth hormone products, each of which
	utilize unmodified growth hormone as the active drug substance. Neither of these products has achieved commercial success, due to manufacturing, regulatory, efficacy safety and/or tolerability reasons associated with the sustained release
	technology. To address the unmet medical needs of GHD, we are developing TransCon hGH for once-weekly administration. TransCon hGH is a prodrug that releases unmodified growth hormone and thus maintains the same mode of action as currently
	prescribed daily hGH therapies, which we believe reduces clinical and regulatory risk. If approved, TransCon hGH may reduce the burden of daily treatment by requiring significantly fewer injections, which may improve compliance and treatment
	outcomes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to achieve regulatory and commercial success, we believe that a new long-acting hGH product must provide a comparable
	safety, efficacy and tolerability profile to currently marketed daily hGH therapies. We have been developing TransCon hGH to provide patients, physicians, regulators, third-party payors and managed care administrators with a product profile that
	builds upon the longstanding and trusted use of currently approved daily hGH therapies, but in a dosage form that allows for once-weekly as opposed to daily injections. Key parameters of this profile include:

	, marketed by United Therapeutics, belongs to a class of drugs known as prostacyclins, and is the leading infused therapy for the treatment of PAH. TransCon Treprostinil is designed as a
	once-daily self-administered subcutaneous injection, offering the same efficacy as continuously infused prostacyclins with a safer and improved tolerability profile. TransCon Treprostinil is expected to offer significant advantages as compared to
	currently infused prostacyclin therapies, including minimizing injection site pain and the risk of bloodstream infection. In April 2015 we announced data from the Phase 1 single ascending dose study of TransCon Treprostinil. TransCon Treprostinil
	produced dose-dependent increases in plasma Treprostinil levels in line with expectations. However, Treprostinil-related injection-site tolerability issues did not meet the criteria defined in the target product profile. We are conducting additional
	research on new product formulations of TransCon Treprostinil and plans to resume clinical development when product improvements to mitigate current limitations have been addressed.

	Our TransCon technology enables us to create long-acting prodrug therapies with potentially significant
	advantages over existing marketed drug products. Conventional prodrugs are inactive, or significantly less active, forms of a parent drug that are designed to be activated only after undergoing transformation in the body, for example when enzymes
	cleave the parent drug from a prodrug molecule. Our TransCon technology transiently links an unmodified parent drug to a TransCon carrier via our proprietary TransCon linkers. Our TransCon linkers predictably release an unmodified active parent drug
	at predetermined rates governed by physiological pH and temperature conditions, supporting administration frequencies from daily up to half-yearly. TransCon prodrugs may offer safety, efficacy and tolerability advantages over the original parent
	drug and as compared to other technologies used to extend drug residence time in the body. Depending upon the type of TransCon carrier we employ, we can design our TransCon prodrugs to act systemically or locally in areas that are difficult to treat
	with conventional therapies.

	When we apply our TransCon technology to already approved drug compounds, we may benefit from established
	clinical safety and efficacy data, which we believe reduces drug development risk and may allow us to utilize expedited approval pathways provided by the FDA and European regulatory authorities. Examples of regulatory strategies that may be
	available to us or our collaboration partners include the FDA&#146;s section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, which was established to allow companies developing drug products to obtain approval by relying in part on studies of safety and
	effectiveness that were not conducted by or for the applicant. Because approval can rest in part on data already accepted by the FDA or otherwise available in the public domain, fewer and smaller studies may&nbsp;be required, thus mitigating costs
	and shortening development time.&nbsp;Section 505(b)(2) filings can provide expedited approval for a wide range of products, especially for those that represent a limited change from an existing or approved drug, including prodrugs of already
	approved parent drugs. We plan to pursue a 505(b)(2) regulatory strategy for TransCon hGH.&nbsp;If successful in this strategy, it is possible that a single Phase 3 clinical study utilizing the active comparator Genotropin

	Frequent administration and poor tolerability negatively impact patient compliance, potentially leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes. To address these issues, several approaches are currently
	applied to improve drug characteristics, such as prodrug and sustained release technologies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A prodrug is an inactive or significantly
	less active form of a parent drug, and prodrug technology has been used to improve drug characteristics such as absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Prodrugs require transformation into the active drug after administration to the
	patient.&nbsp;Conventional prodrug technologies rely upon metabolic processes, such as enzymatic conversion or spontaneous hydrolysis, to release the active drug. These technologies do not facilitate predictable release of the parent drug or provide
	for an extended duration of action. Metabolic conversion of prodrugs may differ between patients, and even within different tissues within the same patient, and spontaneous hydrolysis is generally a rapidly occurring process which may result in a
	release of high concentrations of the active drug.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Several technologies have been developed to extend drug exposure, including
	technologies that permanently modify the drug molecule. Protein enlargement technologies, such as permanent PEGylation and protein fusion, work by enlarging the size of a drug molecule, which reduces the body&#146;s ability to excrete the analog and
	thereby extends duration of action. As the analog resulting from these technologies is no longer identical to the parent drug, it may have a different mode of action within the body that can lead to altered safety and efficacy outcomes. Generally,
	the half-life extension achievable with protein enlargement technologies extends up to two weeks.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Similarly, modification of drug
	molecules with fatty acids can facilitate binding to albumin, a naturally occurring protein, which delays excretion of the drug-fatty acid derivative and imparts an extended half-life as compared to the unmodified drug. This approach has been
	applied to create approved drugs with daily administration profiles. Published data from development stage compounds suggest that once-weekly dosing profiles for peptides can be achieved, but less sustained half-life extension is achieved when
	applied to proteins.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Encapsulation is a different approach to extending drug exposure without altering or modifying the structure of the
	parent drug, thus maintaining the parent drug&#146;s original mode of action. The parent drug is encapsulated in an inactive polymer matrix, which releases the unmodified drug both by diffusion through the polymer matrix and by biodegradation of the
	polymer itself. Drug release from encapsulated drug depots generally occurs in multiple phases and is characterized by a rapid burst release followed by a period of slower drug release. The initial high drug levels from the burst release may be
	associated with a higher risk of side effects. In addition, the polymers used for encapsulation are frequently associated with adverse reactions at the injection site, which may negatively affect tolerability. Furthermore, encapsulation approaches
	are known to activate the immune system, causing an antibody response to proteins and peptides formulated with these technologies.

	broadly applicable to proteins, peptides and small molecules. TransCon prodrugs predictably release unmodified active parent drugs and may offer advantages that include superior efficacy, safety, tolerability and compliance, including less frequent
	dosing and the ability to switch patients to subcutaneous injections from burdensome continuous infusions and less frequent dosing.

	Our
	TransCon technology is differentiated in that it enables us to design long-acting prodrugs that predictably release an unmodified active parent drug. Our TransCon linkers predictably release an unmodified active parent drug at predetermined rates
	governed by physiological pH and temperature conditions, supporting administration frequencies from daily up to half-yearly. TransCon prodrugs may offer safety, efficacy and tolerability advantages over the original parent drug and as compared to
	other technologies used to extend drug residence time in the body. Depending upon the type of TransCon carrier we employ, we can design our TransCon prodrugs to act systemically or locally in areas that are difficult to treat with conventional
	therapies. In addition to retaining the original mode of action of the unmodified parent drug, we believe this predictable release may improve the likelihood of clinical development success.

	soluble carriers and microparticle carriers, provides us with a powerful and flexible technology that we leverage to design best-in-class therapeutics aimed at multi-billion dollar markets. The broad applicability of the TransCon technology is

	Our TransCon linkers are reversible linkers that enable the transient conjugation of a broad range of therapeutics, including proteins,
	peptides and small molecules, to our TransCon carriers. We have a large library of TransCon linkers that are applicable to various types of parent drugs, and that can be tailored to achieve half-life extension enabling daily, weekly, monthly and
	half-yearly dosing. TransCon linkers are self-cleaving through a process called intra-molecular assisted cleavage, which causes the linker to release the unmodified parent drug. We can tailor the release properties of the linker to a given
	therapeutic indication and parent drug by modifying the linker structures. We believe the self-cleaving process of our linker avoids many of the shortcomings of conventional prodrug technologies, which often depend on metabolic processes, such as
	enzymatic degradation, to convert the prodrug into the active drug. The rate of metabolic conversion of prodrugs in these types of processes may differ between patients, and even within different tissues in the same patient. As a result,
	conventional prodrugs do not offer predictable release of the parent drug. Our TransCon linkers predictably release an unmodified active parent drug at predetermined rates governed by physiological pH and temperature conditions, which are tightly
	regulated in the body. Consequently, we can design our linkers to release the drug at predictable rates.

	Our lead product candidate is TransCon human Growth Hormone, or TransCon hGH, for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency, or GHD. Leading
	products for the treatment of GHD require that patients, the majority of whom are children, receive daily injections over many years. The burden of daily administration often results in poor patient compliance, potentially leading to suboptimal
	treatment outcomes. Despite this, global annual sales from currently marketed hGH products exceeded $3 billion in 2014 according to Medtrack. We are developing TransCon hGH as a prodrug with once-weekly administration that releases unmodified growth
	hormone, maintaining the same mode of action as daily hGH therapies. Clinical studies of TransCon hGH have demonstrated a comparable efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenic profile to that of daily growth hormone. If approved, TransCon hGH
	may reduce the burden of daily treatment by requiring significantly fewer injections, which may improve compliance and treatment outcomes. We have successfully completed Phase 2 studies of TransCon hGH in children and adults with GHD. In July 2015,
	we announced positive top-line results from a six-month Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-weekly TransCon hGH in 53 treatment-na&iuml;ve pre-pubertal children with GHD. We plan to conduct an End of Phase 2 meeting with the
	FDA and consult with the EMA, and then initiate a Phase 3 study in growth hormone deficient children in mid-2016. In addition, we are developing a pen device with Medicom Innovation Partner A/S for administration of TransCon hGH that is designed to
	be easy-to-use in the pediatric population and leverages proven technologies.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	GHD is a serious orphan disease that affects both children and adults. Children with GHD are characterized by short stature, metabolic
	abnormalities, cognitive deficiencies and poor quality of life. GHD in adults is associated with premature mortality, increased adiposity, or fat mass, as well as psychiatric-cognitive, cardiovascular, muscular, metabolic and skeletal abnormalities.
	Due to its small size, hGH distributes throughout the body, where it acts directly on organs and tissue. Through interaction with the GH receptors, which are present in virtually every tissue, hGH stimulates the production of IGF-I, or insulin-like
	growth factor I. IGF-I amplifies the anabolic effects of hGH, but has insulin-like effects in fat tissue, thus stimulating fat formation. This is in contrast to hGH which stimulates the breakdown of fat. hGH is used for the long-term treatment of
	children and adults that fail to secrete adequate amounts of endogenous growth hormone. Daily hGH therapies have been shown to increase growth and improve metabolic effects, including reducing adiposity and improving cardiovascular health. These
	therapies have been shown to be safe, well-tolerated and essentially pain-free upon injection. Compliant GHD children initially achieve &#147;catch-up growth,&#148; enabling patients to approach or achieve normal height on a standard growth curve.
	Height velocity following the &#147;catch-up&#148; period normalizes, permitting the patients to maintain normal growth throughout the course of treatment. Patients that are non-compliant generally achieve lower &#147;catch-up growth&#148; and fail
	to achieve expected treatment outcomes. Primary indications for hGH in children are GHD, Idiopathic Short Stature, kidney disease, Prader-Willi Syndrome and Turner&#146;s syndrome. In adults, primary indications for hGH include GHD and AIDS-induced
	weight loss.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The use of hGH was introduced in 1981, and since then many of the world&#146;s largest pharmaceutical companies have
	developed and now market daily growth hormone injections. Since the 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry has employed various approaches to develop long-acting growth hormone products to reduce the patient burden of daily injections and increase
	patient compliance with the dosing regimen.&nbsp;To date, regulatory authorities have approved only two long-acting growth hormone products, each of which utilize unmodified growth hormone as the active drug substance. Neither of these products has
	achieved commercial success, due to manufacturing, regulatory, efficacy, safety and/or tolerability reasons.

	Pediatric indications comprise up to 90% of the total hGH market, of which approximately half is for GHD. Patients treated with daily hGH
	typically receive thousands of injections over the course of many years. Growth hormone deficient children who are fully compliant with their daily treatment regimen may achieve a height in adulthood that is comparable to that of their family
	members and national norms. In therapy-compliant adults with GHD, daily subcutaneous injections of hGH have resulted in improved body composition parameters, bone density, cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life.

	Despite the demonstrated benefits of hGH therapy, published studies have shown that the majority of patients on a daily hGH regimen are not

	Modification technologies prolong growth hormone activity in the body by creating analogs of growth hormone through permanent modification of
	the growth hormone molecule. This modification may alter the molecular size and interaction with the growth hormone receptor and/ or change the natural association affinity to endogenous proteins, thereby reducing the body&#146;s ability to excrete
	the analog. We believe that these changes may alter the mode of action and distribution of modified growth hormone analogs into key growth hormone responsive tissues, such as brain, bone, muscle and fat, compared to unmodified growth hormone. These
	changes may alter and reduce the efficacy of these drugs compared to unmodified daily growth hormone and may also negatively impact the drug&#146;s safety. For instance, a modified growth hormone previously being developed by Pfizer was discontinued
	due to lipoatrophy, a condition of localized loss of fat tissue that can cause undesirable skin deformations, at the injection site following repeated administration in adult patients with GHD.

	observed following administration of daily growth hormone. We believe that TransCon hGH may have a more favorable safety profile because it results in growth hormone levels comparable to daily growth hormone. We also believe that it may not be

	The Phase 2 pediatric study profiled IGF-I levels, the primary biomarker for GHD, during week 13. This profile
	demonstrated a dose-proportionality in IGF-I levels between the three TransCon hGH doses. The normal range for IGF-I in children varies with age, so IGF-I levels are expressed as IGF-I standard deviation scores, or IGF-I SDS, which enables the
	comparison of IGF-I responses for children across age ranges. The normal range is defined as IGF-I SDS between -2 and +2 SDS. The mean IGF-I response for all TransCon hGH dose levels were maintained in the normal range. Transient point values of
	IGF-I SDS &gt; +2 were observed in a small number of patients and only in the high-dose treatment arm. These results are consistent with published data evaluating the effects of comparable doses of daily hGH on IGF-I. There were no reports of safety
	issues in connection with these transient elevations.

	The annualized height velocity reported from the December 2014 interim analysis compares favorably in a cross-study comparison with the height

	PAH is a life-threatening disease characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. As the disease worsens, the right side of
	the heart works harder to pump blood to the lungs and this eventually leads to right heart failure and, ultimately, death. Treatments for PAH aim to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and slow disease progression. In many cases, improvement in
	a patient&#146;s exercise capacity, as measured by the 6 minute walk distance test, is used as an indicator of therapeutic effect. Mild-to-moderately affected PAH patients can frequently be managed with oral therapies such as PDE-5 inhibitors and
	endothelin receptor antagonists. Oral or inhaled prostacyclin analog therapy may be added as symptoms worsen.&nbsp;Patients suffering from severe PAH may receive continuously infused prostacyclin analog therapies.

	Intravenous prostacyclin analogs are delivered continuously through a surgically
	implanted central venous catheter. These catheters are inserted into major veins close to the heart to maximize drug delivery to the lungs and blood vessels. Typically a pump device containing a reservoir for medication refilling is connected to the
	catheter and must be worn or carried externally for years after diagnosis. Patients or their families are required to prepare the drug refill solution aseptically in a specialized designated clean area of their home every 24 to 48 hours, followed by
	refilling of the infusion pump. If strict aseptic preparation procedures are not followed, patients receiving intravenously infused prostacyclin may face sepsis, a life threatening bloodstream infection.

	TransCon Treprostinil is a prodrug, designed to be

	levels comparable to continuous infusion. Our TransCon prodrug technology extends the half-life of treprostinil in the body to ensure continuous exposure. We believe the long half-life may minimize the risk of potentially fatal rebound PAH, which

	The pharmaceutical industry
	is very competitive and subject to rapid and significant innovation. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies,
	universities, and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have greater resources, as well as larger research and development staff and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain
	regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products.

	Smaller or

	that are superior to, or more effectively marketed than, the product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. For additional information regarding the companies

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in
	which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays
	in patent prosecution by the patentee. A patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. The patent term of a European patent is 20 years
	from its filing date, which, unlike in the United States, is not subject to patent term adjustments.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The term of a patent that covers an
	FDA-approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
	Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under
	regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in
	Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We anticipate
	that some of our issued patents may be eligible for patent term extensions.

	In the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, which regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
	or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. The FDCA and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture,

	data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective and a clinical trial proposed in the
	IND may begin 30 days after the FDA receives the IND, unless during this 30-day waiting period, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case,

	After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and
	inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions
	that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may
	decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial

	As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may
	submit an NDA under Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not
	conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA&#146;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or
	clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new
	product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.

	In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose
	claims cover the applicant&#146;s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking
	approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1)&nbsp;no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the
	application has been submitted to the FDA; (2)&nbsp;such patent has expired; (3)&nbsp;the date on which such patent expires; or (4)&nbsp;such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for
	which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder
	of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers.&nbsp;The applicant may also elect to submit a &#147;section viii&#148; statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the
	patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a
	patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the
	paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant.&nbsp;The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable
	non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.&nbsp;Specifically, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an
	ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active
	moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An &#147;active moiety&#148; is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance&#146;s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the
	FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA&#146;s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for
	filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification.

	to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical study is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#146;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of FDA-requested pediatric studies are submitted to and
	accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the
	regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application relying on the NDA sponsor&#146;s data.

	The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization from the European Commission following a
	favorable opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, of the EMA that is valid in all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines
	produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products) and products with a new active
	substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products
	containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the
	maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be
	granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated
	assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding clock stops.

	products that are similar to an already authorized product, but do not fall within the definition of a generic medicinal product, their bioequivalence to the reference product cannot be demonstrated through bioavailability studies, or their active

	In the EEA, the EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products
	grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the E.U.
	Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the
	diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary
	investment in developing the medicinal product. An E.U. orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval.
	This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must
	be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

	In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have
	to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA&#146;s Pediatric Committee, or the PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to
	generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to
	demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or
	unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the

	harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory
	exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the
	arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#146;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving
	remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.

	Additionally, the intent
	standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such
	that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services
	resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented,
	a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#147;any
	request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that
	the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#146; marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition,
	the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not
	provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the
	payor.

	The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new
	federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully
	falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the
	Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to

	In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation
	of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and &#147;transfers of value&#148; provided to
	physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value
	and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#147;knowing failures.&#148; Covered manufacturers were required to begin
	collecting data on August&nbsp;1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to the government for the first reporting period (August 1, 2013 &#150; December&nbsp;31, 2013) by March&nbsp;31, 2014, and required to report detailed payment data
	for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the completeness and accuracy of such data by June&nbsp;30, 2014. Thereafter, covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition,
	certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry&#146;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose
	restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.

</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug or medical device products for which we obtain
	regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of
	the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory
	approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and
	other organizations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug or medical device product
	typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug
	products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of
	our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug or medical device product does not imply that an
	adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage
	and reimbursement for new products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor&#146;s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical
	product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will
	be a time-consuming process.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the
	prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, medical devices
	and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they
	do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have
	attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. By way of example, in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the
	way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient drug purchases by those covered by Medicare under a new Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales
	prices for Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs, including drugs currently on the market used by physicians to treat the clinical indications for which we are currently seeking FDA approval and likely our product candidates, if approved. As
	a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, there is additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow
	Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. These cost reduction
	initiatives and other provisions of the MMA could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products, and could seriously harm our business.

	In addition, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things,

	inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D

	On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on

	government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
	On January&nbsp;2, 2013, the American Tax Payer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals.

	We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company applying our TransCon technology to develop a pipeline of long-acting prodrug therapies with
	best-in-class profiles to address large markets with significant unmet medical needs. We are developing our lead product candidate, TransCon human growth hormone, or TransCon hGH, for once-weekly administration to treat growth hormone deficiency, or
	GHD, and other indications. We have successfully completed Phase&nbsp;2 studies of TransCon hGH in children and adults with GHD. In July 2015, we announced positive top-line results from a six-month Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
	of once-weekly TransCon hGH in 53 treatment-na&iuml;ve, pre-pubertal children with GHD. Using our TransCon technology, we have established a new paradigm that combines the benefits of conventional prodrug and sustained release technologies, and is
	broadly applicable to proteins, peptides and small molecules. In addition to TransCon hGH, we have developed a pipeline of long-acting prodrug product candidates such as TransCon Treprostinil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or
	PAH, TransCon Peptides, for the treatment of diabetes, partnered with Sanofi, and TransCon Ranibizumab, in the field of ophthalmology, partnered with Genentech.

	We commenced operations in December 2007 when we acquired Complex Biosystems GmbH, the company that invented the TransCon technology. Since we
	commenced operations in 2007, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
	We do not have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. Since our inception through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have funded our operations through the sale of &#128;186.6&nbsp;million of our preference shares,
	ordinary shares and convertible debt securities, including our IPO and exercise of warrants, and we have received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately &#128;73.3&nbsp;million from collaboration partners for up-front technology licensing fees,
	assignment of certain intellectual property rights and for services rendered under those agreements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To date, we have only
	generated revenue from license fees, the assignment of certain intellectual property rights, research and development services rendered under collaboration agreements and feasibility studies performed for potential partners. We have not yet
	generated any revenue from commercial product sales. Our collaboration agreements comprise elements of up-front license fees, milestone payments based on development and sales and royalties based on product sales. In addition, our collaboration
	agreements contemplate our involvement in the ongoing research and development of our partnered product candidates, for which we are paid fees for the services we render.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to the revenue that we have generated from our collaborations, we also generate revenue for services performed on feasibility
	studies for potential partners to evaluate if our TransCon technology enables certain advantages for their product candidates of interest. Such feasibility studies are often structured as short-term agreements with fixed fees for the work that we
	perform.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The timing of our operating cash flows may vary significantly from the recognition of the related revenue. In general, income
	from up-front or initiation payments is deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continued involvement. Other revenue, such as milestone payments or service fees, is recognized when earned; that is, when the milestone has been achieved
	or the services have been performed. Our revenue has varied substantially, and is expected to continue to vary, from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending upon, among other things, the structure and timing of milestone events, the number of
	milestones achieved, the level of revenues earned for ongoing development efforts, any new collaboration arrangements we may enter into and the terms we are able to negotiate with our collaboration partners. We therefore believe that
	period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indicative of our future revenues.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Research and development costs represent costs incurred to conduct discovery and development of our proprietary product candidates as well as
	research and development of product candidates for our collaboration partners and costs related to services performed on feasibility studies for potential collaboration partners. We expense all research costs as they are incurred, with development
	costs being expensed to the extent they do not meet the criteria for capitalization. To date, we have not capitalized any of our development costs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our research and development costs consist primarily of manufacturing costs, preclinical and clinical study costs, personnel costs, the cost
	of premises, the cost of obtaining and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, and the depreciation of assets used in research and development activities. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and share-based payments.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We incur various external expenses under our collaboration agreements for material and services consumed in the development of our partnered
	product candidates. Under our collaboration agreements, our collaboration partners reimburse us for these external expenses. We recognize these reimbursements as a reduction of research and development costs. External expenses that are not
	reimbursed are recognized as research and development costs in the period in which they are incurred.

	Government grants are recognized
	when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions underlying the grant have been met and that the grant will be received. We did not receive any government grants in 2015 or 2014. In 2013, we received grants from the German Bundesministerium
	for development activities related to early stage research applying our TransCon technology to various therapeutic compounds and disease categories. Government grants to cover research and development costs incurred are recognized as a reduction of
	research and development costs proportionally over the periods during which the related research and development expenses are incurred.

	We manage our research and development costs on a consolidated portfolio basis, and do not track

	allocable to particular development projects, such as manufacturing costs, preclinical and clinical study costs and certain consultancy fees to the extent such fees are tracked on a product candidate-by-product candidate basis. External costs are
	tracked on a product candidate-by-product candidate basis only once a product has reached a more advanced stage of development. Indirect costs comprise internal costs and costs that are not attributable to a particular development project or product

	The division between direct
	and indirect research and development costs is not necessarily indicative of how we allocate resources to specific projects or the overall use of resources within our research and development organization. Certain research and development costs
	related to our partnered product candidates are incurred by or reimbursed by our collaboration partners, which has the effect of reducing or eliminating the research and development costs incurred by us for such product candidates. Furthermore, our
	collaboration partners typically carry the majority of the research and development costs for product candidates at amounts that are not known or made available to us. Therefore, our research and development costs will not reflect a complete picture
	of all financial resources devoted to our product candidates, nor will such historical costs necessarily reflect the stage of development for particular product candidates or development projects.

	&#128;5.9&nbsp;million, or 42%, compared to &#128;14.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. This change was primarily driven by a decrease of &#128;3.2&nbsp;million in revenue from our collaboration with United Therapeutics as a
	result of the collaboration ending at June&nbsp;30, 2014. Revenue from our collaboration with Sanofi decreased by &#128;2.5&nbsp;million due to fewer services rendered by us under our collaboration, whereas revenue from our collaboration with

	&#128;6.5&nbsp;million which resulted from the completion of the period over which we recognized the original upfront payment under the Sanofi collaboration agreement as revenue. Revenue from our collaboration with United Therapeutics decreased by
	&#128;4.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 due to fewer services rendered by us to United Therapeutics and due to the initial collaboration period ending at June&nbsp;30,
	2014. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in revenue from our collaboration with Genentech of &#128;4.3 million. The collaboration with Genentech was initiated in July 2013, and accordingly, only two quarters of revenue were recognized
	from this collaboration during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013.

	&#128;1.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The significant increase in net finance income was due to positive exchange rate fluctuations, primarily between the U.S. dollars and Euro. We maintained the funds from our series D
	financing in November 2014 and IPO in February 2015 in U.S. dollars for a portion of the first quarter of 2015, generating a significant exchange rate gain. At the end of March 2015, we converted approximately $90 million to Euros and British
	Pounds, thereby realizing a significant exchange rate gain and reducing our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, as these cash positions more closely reflect the currencies in which we expect to incur the majority of our future expenses. We

	According to the Danish Companies Act, the general meeting is allowed to discharge our board members and members of our senior management from
	liability for any particular financial year based on a resolution relating to the financial statements. This discharge means that the general meeting will discharge such board members and members of our senior management from liability to our
	company; however, the general meeting cannot discharge any claims by individual shareholders or other third parties.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, we
	have entered into agreements with our board members and members of our senior management, pursuant to which, subject to limited exceptions, we have agreed to indemnify such board members and members of our senior management from civil liability,
	including (i)&nbsp;any damages or fines payable by them as a result of an act or failure to act in the exercise of their duties currently or previously performed by them; (ii)&nbsp;any reasonable costs of conducting a defense against a claim; and
	(iii)&nbsp;any reasonable costs of appearing in other legal proceedings in which such individuals are involved as current or former board members or members of our senior management.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is a risk that such agreement will be deemed void under Danish law, either because the agreement is deemed contrary to the rules on
	discharge of liability in the Danish Companies Act, as set forth above, because the agreement is deemed contrary to sections 19 and 23 of the Danish Act on Damages, which contain mandatory provisions on recourse claims between an employee (including
	members of our senior management) and the company, or because the agreement is deemed contrary to the general provisions of the Danish Contracts Act.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	In performing its duties, our board of directors is required to act in the interests of our
	company (including our shareholders) and our associated business as a whole. Our board of directors may generally make any decisions in furtherance of our objectives that are not reserved for either the executive board or the shareholders either by
	virtue of the articles of association or by operation of Danish law. Typical shareholder decisions that our board of directors cannot resolve alone are: changes to the articles of association, elections of board members, elections of auditors,
	decisions to scrutinize our company&#146;s affairs, capital increases and decreases, payment of dividends, purchase of treasury shares, and decisions to merge, demerge or liquidate our company.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The general meeting of shareholders must elect no fewer than three and no more than 10 members to our board of directors. The board of
	directors is classified into two classes as nearly equal in number as possible with respect to the duration of the term in which they severally hold office. Such classes consist of one class of directors (&#147;Class I&#148;) who were elected at the
	annual general meeting held in 2015 for a term expiring at the annual general meeting to be held 2017; and a second class of directors (&#147;Class II&#148;) who were elected at the annual general meeting held in 2015 for a term expiring at the
	annual general meeting to be held in 2016. The shareholders shall increase or decrease the number of directors, in order to ensure that the two classes shall be as nearly equal in number as possible; provided, however, that no decrease shall have
	the effect of shortening the term of any other director. At each annual general meeting beginning in 2016, the successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual
	general meeting held in the second year following the year of their election.

	Board members may be dismissed at any time at a general
	meeting of shareholders. A resolution by the general meeting of shareholders to appoint or dismiss board members requires a simple majority of the votes cast and there is no requirement for a specific quorum.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under Danish corporate law, employees of companies that have employed at least 35 employees for the preceding three years are entitled to
	elect members of their board of directors corresponding to one-half of the members of their board of directors elected by the general meeting of shareholders. Board members elected by the employees are elected for terms of four years, and they hold
	the same rights and obligations as any board member elected by the shareholders. We do not currently have employee representatives on our board of directors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our board of directors elects its chairman. Our board of directors forms a quorum when more than half of the members of our board of directors
	are represented. Resolutions of our board of directors are passed by simple majority. Each board member is entitled to cast one vote. For a complete description of these board governance matters, you should refer to our articles of association,
	which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this annual report.
</P>

	In accordance with the exemption available to foreign private issuers under NASDAQ rules, we do
	not follow the requirements of the NASDAQ rules with regard to the process of nominating board members, and instead, follow Danish law and practice, in accordance with which our board of directors (or a committee thereof) is authorized to recommend
	to our shareholders director nominees for election. Under the Danish Companies Act, nominations for directors also may be made upon the request of any shareholder.

	Our board of
	directors has undertaken a review of the independence of the directors and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise their ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
	of a director. As a result of this review, our board of directors determined that Albert Cha, M.D., Ph.D., James I. Healy, M.D., Ph.D., Martin Olin, Jonathan T. Silverstein, J.D. and Rafa&egrave;le Tordjman, M.D., Ph.D. representing five of our
	seven directors, are &#147;independent directors&#148; as that term is defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing requirements and rules of Nasdaq. In making such determination, our board of directors considered
	the relationships that each non-employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining the director&#146;s independence, including the number of ordinary shares beneficially owned by
	the director and his or her affiliated entities (if any).

	March&nbsp;31, 2016 through the exercise of any warrants or other rights. Except as otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property laws, the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all

	The percentage of shares beneficially owned is computed on the basis of 25,128,242 ordinary shares
	outstanding as of March&nbsp;31, 2016. Ordinary shares that a person has the right to subscribe for within 60&nbsp;days of March&nbsp;31, 2016 are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of the person holding such
	rights, but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Additionally, a person is considered to have the right to subscribe for ordinary shares which are subject to outstanding warrants and
	vested within 60 days of March&nbsp;31, 2016, although such warrants may only be exercised in prescribed exercise periods. Unless otherwise indicated below, the address for each beneficial owner listed is c/o&nbsp;Ascendis Pharma A/S, at Tuborg
	Boulevard 5, DK-2900 Hellerup, Denmark.

	out interim dividends shall be accompanied by a balance sheet, and the board of directors determine whether it will be sufficient to use the balance sheet from the annual report or if an interim balance sheet for the period from the annual report
	period until the interim dividend payment shall be prepared. If interim dividends are paid out later than six months following the financial year for the latest annual report, an interim balance sheet showing that there are sufficient funds shall

<I>
	i.e.

	When considering the taxation of Danish tax resident holders of the ADSs (companies and individuals), it is assumed that for tax purposes
	Danish tax resident holders of the ADSs should be treated as holders of unlisted shares in the company. It is currently not clear under the Danish tax legislation or case law how the listed ADSs are to be treated for tax purposes. For the purpose of
	the below comments, it is assumed that the ADSs listed in the U.S. should be treated as non-listed shares as the company&#146;s ordinary shares are not admitted to trading on a regulated market.

	Gains from the sale of shares are taxed as share income at a rate of 27% on the first DKK 50,600 (for cohabiting spouses, a total of DKK
	101,200) and at a rate of 42% on share income exceeding DKK&nbsp;50,600 (for cohabiting spouses over DKK 101,200). Such amounts are subject to annual adjustments and include all share income (
<I>
	i.e.
</I>
	, all capital gains and dividends derived by
	the individual or cohabiting spouses, respectively).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Gains and losses on the sale of shares are calculated as the difference between the
	purchase price and the sales price. The purchase price is generally determined using the average method as a proportionate part of the aggregate purchase price for all the shareholder&#146;s shares in the company.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Losses on non-listed shares may be offset against other share income, (
<I>
	i.e.
</I>
	, received dividends and capital gains on the sale of
	shares). Unused losses will automatically be offset against a cohabiting spouse&#146;s share income. In case the share income becomes negative, a negative tax on the share income will be calculated and offset against the individual&#146;s other
	final taxes. Unused negative tax on share income will be offset against a cohabiting spouse&#146;s final taxes. If the negative tax on share income cannot be offset against a cohabiting spouse&#146;s final taxes, the negative tax can be carried
	forward indefinitely and offset against future year&#146;s taxes.

	The discussion below assumes that the representations contained in the deposit agreement are true and that the obligations in the deposit
	agreement and any related agreement will be complied with in accordance with their terms. Generally, a holder of an ADS should be treated for the U.S. federal income tax purposes as holding the ordinary shares represented by the ADS. Accordingly, no
	gain or loss will be recognized upon an exchange of ADSs for ordinary shares. The U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that intermediaries in the chain of ownership between the holder of an ADS and the issuer of the security underlying the ADS may
	be taking actions that are inconsistent with the beneficial ownership of the underlying security. Accordingly the creditability of foreign taxes, if any, as described below, could be affected by actions taken by intermediaries in the chain of
	ownership between the holders of ADSs and our company if as a result of such actions the holders of ADSs are not properly treated as beneficial owners of underlying ordinary shares.

	Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, the gross amount of any distribution to you with respect to the ADSs will be included in your gross
	income as dividend income when actually or constructively received to the extent that the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). To the extent the amount
	of the distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, it will be treated first as a return of your tax basis in the ADSs, and to the extent the amount of the distribution exceeds your tax basis, the excess will be taxed as
	capital gain. We do not intend to calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles. Therefore, a U.S. Holder should expect a distribution will generally be reported as ordinary dividend income for such purposes. Any
	dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations.

	As discussed in &#147;Taxation&#151;Danish Tax Considerations,&#148; payments of dividends by us may be subject to Danish withholding tax. The
	rate of withholding tax applicable to U.S. Holders that are eligible for benefits under the Treaty is reduced to a maximum of 15%. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. Holders will be treated as having received the amount of Danish taxes
	withheld by us, and as then having paid over the withheld taxes to the Danish taxing authorities. As a result of this rule, the amount of dividend income included in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes by a U.S. Holder with respect to

	rules below, any tax withheld with respect to distributions on the ADSs at the rate applicable to a U.S. Holder may, subject to a number of complex limitations, be claimed as a foreign tax credit against such U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S. federal income
	tax liability or may be claimed as a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. For this purpose, dividends distributed by

	to the difference between the amount realized (in U.S. dollars) on the disposition of the ADS and your tax basis (in U.S. dollars) in the ADS. Any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have
	held the ADS for more than one year at the time of sale, exchange or other taxable disposition. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, including

	Unless otherwise provided by the U.S. Treasury, each U.S.
	shareholder of a PFIC is required to file an annual report containing such information as the U.S. Treasury may require. A U.S. Holder&#146;s failure to file the annual report will cause the statute of limitations for such U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S.
	federal income tax return to remain open with regard to the items required to be included in such report until three years after the U.S. Holder files the annual report, and, unless such failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect,
	the statute of limitations for the U.S. Holder&#146;s entire U.S. federal income tax return will remain open during such period. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the requirements of filing such information returns under these

	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed to provide
	reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that
	(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
	necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
	of the Company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the audited consolidated financial
	statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material
	misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
	deteriorate.

	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. This
	assessment was performed under the directions and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our principal financial and accounting officer, and based on the criteria established in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued
	by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Firstly, a material error in research and
	development costs for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was identified and corrected. Due to a material weakness in the design of our controls related to the recognition of costs for deliverables under our supplier agreements, research and
	development costs were overstated by an amount that should have been recognized in the following financial year. Secondly, we commenced but did not complete the

	A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that
	there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of the financial statement accounts or related
	disclosures that would result in a material misstatement in the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on management&#146;s assessment of those criteria, management has
	concluded that the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on the material weaknesses noted above.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have developed a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses discussed above and to improve our internal controls over financial
	reporting. The plan includes increasing the resources we allocate to the review and interpretation of our agreements with suppliers and the deliverables under such agreements to ensure appropriate recognition of research and development costs. The
	plan also includes completing the documentation and testing of our entity-level controls, controls over financial reporting and controls over our IT applications to support management&#146;s assessment of our internal control over financial

	We do not intend to follow NASDAQ&#146;s requirements regarding shareholder approval for all equity compensation plans. Generally, NASDAQ Rule 5635(c) requires each issuer to obtain shareholder approval of all equity
	compensation plans (including warrant incentive plans) and material amendments to such plans. However, pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5615(a)(3), we have elected to follow our home country&#146;s practices (in this case, being Danish practices) in lieu of
	the requirements of NASDAQ Rule 5635(c). Our home country practices do not require us to obtain a shareholders&#146; approval for amendments to our existing warrant incentive program.

	We have audited the
	accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Ascendis Pharma A/S and subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, and the consolidated statements of profit or loss and other
	comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of changes in equity, and the consolidated cash flow statements for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
	Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in
	accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
	includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
	statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
	present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ascendis Pharma A/S and subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
	the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our revenue currently
	comprises up-front payments and service fees from research, development and commercialization agreements. Our collaboration agreements comprise elements of up-front license fees, milestone payments based on development and sales and royalties based
	on product sales. In addition, our collaboration agreements contemplate our involvement in the ongoing research and development of our partnered product candidates, for which we are separately remunerated for the services we render.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a general principle, revenue is recognized when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to us and these benefits can be
	measured reliably. Further, revenue recognition requires that all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods or services included in the transaction have been transferred to the buyer, and that we retain neither continuing managerial
	involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods or services sold.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Collaboration
	agreements which contain multiple activities are only separated into individual units of accounting if they constitute a separate earnings process. If multiple activities or rights are not separable, they are combined into a single unit of
	accounting, and recognized over the period of continued involvement; i.e. the period where we are actively involved in development and deliver significant services to the collaboration partner. If multiple activities or rights are separable, each
	separate component is accounted for after considering the specific nature of the element and the underlying activities to which earnings process relates. For the three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the collaboration agreements
	entered into by the Company did not meet the criteria for separation, and all arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of account. Accordingly, the up-front license payments have been recognized as revenue over the period of continued
	involvement. In addition, the milestone criteria and sales-based royalty thresholds have not yet been met and such thresholds are not yet considered probable, accordingly no milestone and royalty payments have been received or are expected to be
	received.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If we are entitled to reimbursement from our collaborators for specified research and development expenses and/or entitled to
	payments for specified research and development services that we provide, we determine whether the research and development funding would result in collaborative revenues or an offset to research and development expenses. Where the payment is for
	specific research and development services that are to be accounted for as collaborative revenue, such revenue is recognized when such services are provided. Where such payments are not to be considered to be collaborative revenue but are considered
	to be reimbursements for external expenses incurred, the reimbursements are offset against research and development costs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to
	the revenue that we have generated from our collaborations, we also generate revenue for services performed on feasibility studies for potential partners to evaluate if our TransCon technology enables certain advantages for their product candidates
	of interest. Such feasibility studies are often structured as short-term agreements with fixed fees for the work that we perform.

	of IFRS 9 in the future will have a material impact on amounts reported in respect of the Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities, but the final conclusion on this awaits a more detailed review of the standard.

	In May 2014, IASB issued IFRS 15 &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#148;. The standard is part of the convergence project with FASB to replace IAS 18 &#147;Revenue&#148;. The new standard will establish a
	single, comprehensive framework for revenue recognition, based on a five-step model to determine when, how and at what amount revenue is to be recognized depending on whether certain criteria are met. The standard awaits EU Endorsement. The initial
	effective date was January&nbsp;1, 2017, but in September 2015, the IASB deferred the effective date to January&nbsp;1, 2018. We do not believe that the application of IFRS 15 in the future will have a material impact on amounts reported in respect
	of the Company&#146;s revenues, but the final conclusion on this awaits a more detailed review of the standard.

	In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 &#147;Leases&#148;, which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases. For lessors, there is little change to the existing accounting in IAS 17
	&#147;Leases&#148;. The standard awaits EU Endorsement. The new standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January&nbsp;1, 2019. We believe that the application of IFRS 16 will impact the Company&#146;s balance sheet through
	recognition of assets and liabilities that would currently not be recognized under the current standard, as they are classified as operating lease arrangements.

	IAS 18, &#147;Revenues&#148; prescribes the criteria to be fulfilled for revenue being recognizable. Evaluating the criteria for
	revenue recognition with respect to our research and development and commercialization agreements requires judgment to ensure that all criteria have been fulfilled prior to recognizing any amount of revenue. We generate revenue from collaboration
	agreements which typically involve multiple elements, including licenses to our technology, transfer of patents, participation in joint development projects with our collaboration partners, and other services in various areas related to the
	development of new products. As part of evaluating the criteria for revenue recognition, we consider the separability of the individual deliverables in the collaboration agreements and potential allocation of the total consideration received to the
	individual elements of the agreement. Further, if any up-front elements are considered inseparable from a following development period, the appropriate allocation of an up-front payment over time needs to be determined.

	1,022,908 warrants granted on December&nbsp;18, 2015, there are four annual exercise periods; each exercise period begins two full trading days after the publication of the public release of our earnings data of a fiscal quarter and continues until

	On January&nbsp;13, 2015, in preparation for the
	Company&#146;s IPO, the shareholders decided at an extraordinary general meeting to issue bonus shares in the ratio of 3:1 of the Company&#146;s authorized, issued and outstanding ordinary and preference shares. The decision had a corresponding
	impact on the number of warrants issued and the exercise prices for outstanding warrants. Accordingly, the number of warrants was adjusted upwards in the ratio of 3:1 with a corresponding downward adjustment of the exercise prices in the ratio of
	3:1. As outlined in Note 2, the effect of the bonus shares has been retrospectively reflected in all periods presented in these financial statements.

	Warrant compensation costs are determined with basis in the grant date fair value of the warrants granted and recognized over the
	vesting period. Fair value of the warrants is calculated at the grant dates by use of the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model with the following assumptions: (1)&nbsp;an exercise price equal to or above the estimated market price of our shares at the
	date of grant; (2)&nbsp;an expected lifetime of the warrants determined as a weighted average of the time from grant date to date of becoming exercisable and from grant date to expiry of the warrants; (3)&nbsp;a risk free interest rate equaling the
	effective interest rate on a Danish government bond with the same lifetime as the warrants; (4)&nbsp;no payment of dividends; and (5)&nbsp;a volatility for comparable companies for a historic period equaling the expected lifetime of the warrants.
	The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the warrants is indicative of future trends. The expected volatility has been calculated using a simple average of daily historical
	data of comparable publicly traded companies, as we do not have sufficient data for the volatility of our own share price.

	Goodwill relates to the acquisition of Complex Biosystems GmbH (now Ascendis Pharma GmbH) in 2007. Goodwill
	was calculated as the excess amount of the purchase price to the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Business combinations recognized before January&nbsp;1, 2012, the Group&#146;s date of
	transition to IFRS, have not been adjusted to IFRS 3, &#147;Business Combinations&#148;. Ascendis Pharma GmbH was initially a separate technology platform company, but is now an integral part of our research and development activities, including
	significant participation in the development services provided to our external collaboration partners. Accordingly, it is not possible to look separately at Ascendis Pharma GmbH when considering the recoverable amount of the goodwill. Goodwill is
	monitored and tested for impairment on a consolidated level as we are considered to represent one cash-generating unit. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined based on an estimation of the Company&#146;s fair value less
	costs of disposal. We have determined the fair value of goodwill after taking into account the market value of our ADSs representing the enterprise value of our group enterprises as of the balance sheet date. The computation of our enterprise value
	significantly exceeded the carrying amount of our equity, leaving sufficient value to cover the carrying amount of goodwill. With reference to materiality, we have concluded that no further assumptions need to be applied in determining whether
	goodwill is impaired.

	Goodwill is tested for impairment on a yearly basis at December&nbsp;31, or more frequently, if indications of
	impairment are identified. There have been no impairments recognized in any of the periods presented.

	The

	only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period-end for a 10% change in foreign currency rate. The sensitivity analysis includes external payables and receivables as well as balances held in
	foreign currencies. A positive number indicates an increase in profit before tax or equity where the USD strengthens 10% against the EUR.
