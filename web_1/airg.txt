	We supply antennas that are part of the greater wireless communications industry. All wireless devices, from Wi-Fi routers to mobile handsets,
	require an antenna, or multiple antennas, to communicate with other devices. Antennas are the essential component in enabling wireless connectivity, and their design and application can dramatically affect throughput, range, and reliability of
	wireless devices.

	Wireless technology has grown rapidly. When it was first introduced to the mass market in the United States in the
	mid-1980s, the primary application was analog cellular phone voice services. However, wireless has rapidly evolved as the shift to digital and Internet Protocol ramped up and the explosion of ubiquitous broadband connectivity was born. The rapid
	growth of internet applications, websites and media opportunities has given consumers unlimited uses for wireless devices including managing e-mail, online browsing and shopping, and running applications for business, personal productivity, and
	entertainment and media while on the go. Carriers and enterprises have also realized the economic benefits of wireless connectivity to enable efficient delivery of premium content and internet services in the home, enterprise and mobile markets.
	Over the past decade, wireless technologies such as cellular and Wi-Fi have emerged as mainstream networking platforms to connect people and data via devices. According to the Cisco Visual Networking Index, or the Cisco Report, there were
	approximately 7.9 billion mobile connected devices in 2015&#151;1.1 for every person on Earth. By 2021, there are expected to be approximately 11.6 billion mobile-connected devices, representing nearly 1.5 mobile devices per person on Earth.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The most common form of wireless access is Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is a standard established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or
	IEEE, known technically as 802.11. The Wi-Fi standard is &#147;the most ubiquitous wireless connectivity technology for internet access&#148; according to ABI Research, a market intelligence firm. Wi-Fi enables devices to operate on a local area
	network, or LAN, or wide area network, or WAN, to connect to and access the internet and communicate with others without using cabling or wiring. It adds the convenience of mobility to the powerful utility provided by high-speed data networks, and
	is a natural extension of broadband connectivity in the home and office. Wi-Fi was first utilized in applications such as computers and routers, and is now commonly embedded into everyday electronic devices, such as printers, digital cameras, gaming
	devices, smart phones, tablets and broadband access systems for video and data enablement. In addition, many new products are coming out with multiple wireless capabilities whereby Wi-Fi and other similar wireless protocols have become &#145;must
	have&#146; features to extend a device&#146;s basic utility. As an example, smart devices such as Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy come equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Near Field Communication, or NFC, functions, in addition to traditional
	cellular functions. Each of these represents a separate radio technology, and each radio requires different antenna solutions to provide an optimal user experience.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Wi-Fi market is continuing to grow rapidly as the technology is adopted across a wide variety of markets, including consumer, mobile,
	automotive, and emerging markets such as machine to machine, or M2M. The increase of in-home wireless devices in security and remote monitoring, lighting, HVAC, and entertainment has helped drive the embedded antenna market. According to ABI
	Research, the number of Wi-Fi-enabled device shipments, excluding cellular and personal computers, is expected to exceed 1.3 billion devices annually by 2021, representing a 13% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, in this market for the period
	from 2016 through 2021. Our customers demand an ever increasing number of antennas per device and increasing antenna system complexity to support the evolving and new ways to wirelessly connect. 802.11 standards are expanding and evolving in terms
	of multi-carrier and multi user Multiple Input, Multiple Output, or MIMO, schemes, with a path to higher efficiency WLAN through 802.11ax, and through introducing new frequency bands through Wi-Fi Halo&#153;, WiGig, and

	The following tables set forth a summary of our historical financial data as of, and for the periods ended on, the dates indicated. We have
	derived the statements of operations data for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015 from our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The statements of operations data for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
	2015 and 2016 and the balance sheet data as of September&nbsp;30, 2016 have been derived from our unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus and have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements. In
	the opinion of the management, the unaudited data reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of results as of and for these periods. You should read this data together with our
	financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus and the sections in this prospectus entitled &#147;Selected Financial Data&#148; and &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	Operations.&#148; Our historical results for any prior period are not indicative of our future results, and our results for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2016 may not be indicative of our results for the year ending December&nbsp;31,
	2016.

	The market for our antenna products, and
	specifically the Wi-Fi market, is developing and may not develop as we expect. We believe our future success will depend in large part on the growth in the market for Wi-Fi devices that provide in-home wireless data connectivity for internet and
	video distribution. It is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewal rates, customer demand for our antennas, the size and growth rate of this market, the entry of competitive products, or the success of existing competitive products. Any
	expansion in our market depends on several factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our antennas. If our antenna products do not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for antennas in our
	market caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions, or otherwise, it could result in reduced customer orders, early order
	cancellations, or decreased sales, any of which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

	Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult
	for us to predict our future operating results. The timing and size of sales of our products are variable and difficult to predict and can result in fluctuations in our net sales from period to period. In addition, our budgeted expense levels depend
	in part on our expectations of future sales. Because any substantial adjustment to expenses to account for lower levels of sales is difficult and takes time, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected
	shortfall in net sales, and even a small shortfall in net sales could disproportionately and adversely affect our operating margin and operating results for a given quarter.

	Antenna solutions is an established technical field with low intellectual property and technological barriers to entry. Antenna competition
	exists globally for all areas of our business and product lines. The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants. The markets are
	influenced by, among others, brand awareness and reputation, price, strength and scale of sales and marketing efforts, professional services and customer support, product features, reliability and performance, scalability of products, and breadth of
	product offerings. Due to the proprietary nature of our products, competition occurs primarily at the design stage. As a result, a design win by our competitors or by us typically limits further competition regarding that design. This competition
	could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which would likely seriously harm our business, operating results or financial
	condition. From a cost and control perspective, our products generally cost more than our competitors&#146; products and add a degree of complexity to an OEM and ODM product planning and manufacturing process. If our ability to design antenna
	solutions is deemed to be on par or of lesser value than competing solutions, we could lose our customers and prospects.

	The markets for development,

	Historically, large, integrated telecommunications equipment suppliers controlled access to the wireless broadband infrastructure equipment
	and network management software that could be used to extend the geographic reach of wireless internet networks. However, in recent years, network operators and service providers have been able to purchase wireless broadband infrastructure equipment
	and purchase and implement network management applications from distributors, resellers, and OEMs and ODMs. Increased competition from providers of wireless broadband equipment may result in fewer vendors providing complementary equipment, which
	could harm our business and sales. Broadband equipment providers or system integrators may also offer wireless broadband infrastructure equipment for free or as part of a bundled offering, which could force us to reduce our prices or change our
	selling model to remain competitive. If there is a major shift in the market such that network operators and service providers begin to use closed network solutions that only operate with other equipment from the same vendor, we could experience a
	significant decline in sales because our products would not be interoperable with these proprietary standards.

	subject to short product development windows and short product lifecycles. In the case of the short product development window, we may be pressured to provide solutions that are the lowest in cost to be accepted. Customer pressure could force us to
	reduce our price to win designs with short development windows. Regarding short product lifecycles, we might provide up-front design and engineering work, but ultimately lose the design to a competitor, or even if we win the design, such design
	could be extremely short-lived due to our customers&#146; inability to sell the product in significant volume. Our up-front costs associated with a design can be significant, and if the sales volumes are inadequate due to lack of acceptance and/or

	to come to market with innovative designs that attract customers based upon design, performance, cost, ease of use, and convenience. Product lifecycles can be extremely short as companies try to gain advantage over their competitors. Because of the

	or will be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying, reverse engineering or otherwise obtaining and using our technology, proprietary rights or products. For example, the laws of certain countries in which our products are manufactured or
	licensed do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, or applications for

	We currently

	portion of the net proceeds to us for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or investments.
	However, our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds to us from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of those proceeds. Our management may
	spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock, and you will not have the opportunity to influence management&#146;s decisions on how to use the proceeds from this offering. Our failure
	to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline.

	The public offering price of our common stock is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our common stock

	$17.96&nbsp;per share, which is the last reported sale price of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market on December&nbsp;2, 2016. The exercise of outstanding options and warrants will result in further dilution. In addition, if we raise

	In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of

	We only recently began operating as a public company. As a public company, particularly after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth

	financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As described above, as an emerging growth company, we will not need to
	comply with the auditor attestation provisions of Section 404 for several years. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting
	that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and management time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of
	Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could lose investor confidence in the

	We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the common stock that we are offering will be approximately $20.2&nbsp;million (or
	$25.5&nbsp;million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares from us in full), based upon the assumed public offering price of $17.96&nbsp;per share, which is the last reported sale price of our common stock on The
	NASDAQ Capital Market on December&nbsp;2, 2016, after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed public offering price of
	$17.96&nbsp;per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by $1.2&nbsp;million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting the
	estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering. Each increase (decrease) of 200,000 shares in the number of shares offered by us
	would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $3.4&nbsp;million, assuming that the public offering price stays the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and the
	estimated offering expenses payable by us.

	The principal purposes of this offering are to raise additional capital, facilitate an orderly distribution of
	shares for the selling stockholders and increase our public float. We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, product
	development and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses. However, we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions
	or investments. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed
	obligations of the U.S. government.

	The amounts and timing of our actual expenditure, including expenditure related to sales and
	marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing activities, expansion internationally, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations,
	competitive pressures and other factors described under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in this prospectus. We therefore cannot estimate the amount of net proceeds to be used for the purposes described above. As a result, we may find it necessary or
	advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering.

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Airgain is a leading provider
	of embedded antenna technologies used to enable high performance wireless networking across a broad range of home, enterprise, and industrial devices. Our innovative antenna systems open up exciting new possibilities in wireless services requiring
	high speed throughput, broad coverage footprint, and carrier grade quality. Our antennas are found in devices deployed in carrier, enterprise, and residential wireless networks and systems, including set top boxes, access points, routers, gateways,
	media adapters, and digital televisions. Through our pedigree in the design, integration, and testing of high performance embedded antenna technology, we have become a leading provider to the residential wireless local area networking, also known as
	WLAN or Wi-Fi, antenna market, supplying to leading carriers, Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs, Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, and system designers who depend on us to achieve their wireless performance goals. We also develop
	embedded antenna technology for adjacent markets, including enterprise Wi-Fi systems for on premises and cloud-based services, and for small cellular applications such as Pico and Femto Cells using Long-Term Evolution, or LTE, and Digital Enhanced
	Cordless Telecommunications, or DECT, and high-performance designs for the in-building wireless market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We shipped approximately
	87&nbsp;million antenna products worldwide in 2015 used in approximately 34&nbsp;million devices. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we shipped approximately 115 million antenna products worldwide used in approximately 39 million devices.
	Our products are found in a broad range of devices that generally enable Wi-Fi connectivity for data and video coverage. We sell our products to OEMs and ODMs. These companies compete based on product performance, product features, price, and other
	factors. While our products are found in devices manufactured by global OEMs and ODMs, the products end up primarily in the end-user devices that are deployed in carrier, enterprise, and residential wireless networks, access points, routers,
	residential gateways, set-top boxes, media adapters, and digital televisions. Our global sales force works with telecommunications and broadband carriers and retail-focused customers who seek high performance, reliable wireless solutions. By working
	with these end-user carriers and retail-focused customers, we seek to have service providers influence OEMs and ODMs to specify our antennas for the products they provide to their end-user customers. Our direct sales team works directly with
	customers, and also works with indirect channel partners who pursue sales opportunities that are based in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our sales cycle can be short or lengthy depending upon the specific situation; however, the majority of our revenues are derived from device
	designs with life-cycles of over 12 months. For some recurring customers, we are able to commence volume production of equipment that incorporates our products in less than one calendar quarter. In situations where we are selling to a new customer,
	it may take 12 to 18 months from initial meeting to achieve a design win. Competition generally lengthens the sales process, but our past performance and ability to provide high throughput, highly reliable antenna solutions can shorten the process.
	We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested and expect to continue to invest heavily in our product development efforts to address customer needs, and enable solutions that can address new end markets, such as alternative
	wireless connectivity technologies. In addition, we expect to continue to expand our sales force and engineering organizations and to make additional capital expenditures to further penetrate markets both in the United States and internationally,
	and to continue to expand our research and development for new product offerings and technology solutions.

	Although our sales cycle can be lengthy depending on the specific situation, the majority of our
	revenues are derived from device designs with life-cycles of over a year. In 2015, 80% of our product revenues were from devices in the marketplace for over two years, 11% for devices in the marketplace for one to two years and 9% for devices in the
	marketplace for less than one year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 42% of our product revenues were from devices in the marketplace for over two years, 35% for devices in the marketplace for one to two years and 23% for devices in the
	marketplace for less than one year.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe demand is growing rapidly for our antenna solutions and there is a significant market
	opportunity. As the ability to provide mobile internet access has grown, our solutions and expertise have become more important to prospects and customers. As a passive component, embedded antennas can be viewed as a commodity. However, our design,
	engineering, and research show that antenna selection, placement, and testing can have significant improvements in device performance. We believe that we are chosen when performance is a more significant factor than price, and our distinctive focus
	on superior designs that provide increased range and throughput has allowed us to build a leadership position in the in-home WLAN antenna market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our sales increased 9% last year, from $25.5 million for 2014 to $27.8 million for 2015. Sales have increased each year since 2011, from $10.0
	million in 2011 to $18.2 million in 2012, $25.4 million in 2013, $25.5 million in 2014, and $27.8 million in 2015. However, our historical sales growth has been somewhat inconsistent and should not be considered indicative of our future performance.
	Our net loss has decreased from net losses of $5.1 million in 2011 and $1.1 million in 2012 to net income of $0.2 million in 2013 and $3.6 million in 2014 to a net loss of $0.3 million in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net
	income was $2.6 million.

	Factors Affecting Our Operating Results
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that our performance and future success depend upon several factors, including the average selling price of our products per device,
	the number of antennas per device, manufacturing costs, investments in our growth, and our ability to diversify the number of devices that incorporate our antenna products. Our customers are extremely price conscious, and our operating results are
	affected by pricing pressure which may force us to lower prices below our established list prices. In addition, a few end customer devices which incorporate our antenna products comprise a significant amount of our sales, and the discontinuation or
	modification of such devices may materially and adversely affect our sales and results of operations. We have seen the number of devices increase 69% and number of antennas per device increase 20% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when
	compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our ability to maintain or increase our sales depends on new and existing end customers selecting our antenna solutions for their devices and depends on investments in our growth to address
	customer needs, target new end markets, develop our product offerings and technology solutions and expand internationally. While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges we must
	successfully address. See the section entitled &#147;Risk Factors.&#148;

	Seasonality

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our operating results historically have not been subject to significant seasonal variations. However, our operating results are affected by how
	customers make purchasing decisions around local holidays in China. For example, a national holiday the first week of October in China may cause customers to purchase product in the third quarter ahead of their holiday season to account for higher
	volume requirements in the fourth quarter. In addition, although it is difficult to make broad generalizations, our sales tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year compared to other quarters due to the Chinese New Year. Results for any
	quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year and these patterns may change as a result of general customer demand or product cycles.

	Provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
	management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
	periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and
	tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. We have concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will utilize its deferred tax assets other than those that are offset by reversing temporary differences.

	We believe that the use of Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, is helpful for an
	investor to determine whether to invest in our common stock. In computing Adjusted EBITDA, we also exclude stock-based compensation expense, which represents non-cash charges for the fair value of stock options and other non-cash awards granted to
	employees. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of
	equity instruments that can impact a company&#146;s non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash expense allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and
	those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our Adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as
	other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Our Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as
	an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided
	by GAAP financial results.

	from Skycross, Inc. Total devices increased by 8.0 million devices to 16.6 million devices and by 15.8 million devices to 38.7 million devices for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The average number of antennas per device increased from 2.47 antennas per device for the three months ended
	September 30, 2015 to 2.84 antennas per device for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the average number of antennas per device increased from 2.47 antennas per device for the nine months ended
	September 30, 2015 to 2.98 antennas per device. The average selling price per device for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $0.72 as compared to $0.76 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average selling price per
	device for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $0.77 as compared to $0.79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. When compared with the same periods in the prior year, during the three and nine months ended September 30,
	2016, we sold significantly more board mounted antennas which do not require cables or connectors. Board mounted antennas tend to have lower per unit pricing and higher margins. Additionally, overall demand in the set-top-box and TV markets and the
	incorporation of our antennas in new devices offset by products reaching the end of their lifecycle, contributed to the increase in sales for the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the three months ended and
	nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

	Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased for both the three months ended and nine months ended
	September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross profit percentage is primarily driven by an increase in sales of board mounted antennas which do not require cables or
	connectors. Board mounted antennas tend to have lower per unit pricing and higher gross margins. We anticipate the sales of board mounted antennas as a percentage of sales mix will be lower in future periods which may cause gross profit as a
	percentage of sales to decline.

	Our business enterprise value was estimated using a
	combination of two generally accepted approaches: the income approach and the market-based approach. The income approach estimates enterprise value based on the estimated present value of future net cash flows the business is expected to generate
	over its remaining life. The estimated present value is calculated using a discount rate reflective of the cost of capital associated with an investment in a similar company and risks associated with our cash flow projections. Our discounted cash
	flow projections are sensitive to highly subjective assumptions that we were required to make each valuation date. The market-based approach measures the value of a business through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable investments
	or assets, and in our case, focuses on comparing us to the group of peer companies. In applying this method, valuation multiples are derived from historical operating data of the peer company group. We then apply multiples to our operating data to
	arrive at a range of indicated values of the company. For each valuation, we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the value of invested capital for both the market approach and income approach. The financial forecasts took
	into account our past results and expected future financial performance. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates as the assumptions used are highly subjective and subject to changes as a result of new operating data and economic and other
	conditions that impact our business.

	compensation expense is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the applicable grant date.

	The demand for smart phone, tablet, laptop and notebook connectivity in the home and enterprise is robust. Whereas families often shared a
	single computer and internet connection in the 1990&#146;s, ubiquitous wireless connectivity throughout the home is available today via carrier gateways that enable Internet access and media distribution to multiple smart phones, fixed and mobile
	computing devices and smart TVs that share the same broadband data connections. Wireless access enables mobility and the potential sale of additional services by telecom, cable, and satellite broadcast companies and does not require the time and
	cost for cabling. Additionally, the demand for over-the-top, or OTT, audio and video services from the Internet is strong as families enjoy free or paid content subscriptions to sites such as Netflix, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, Pandora, YouTube, and
	many others on a 24/7 basis. Our business opportunity has been driven by the rapidly expanding market for embedded antenna solutions for in-home wireless data and video connectivity products. Wi-Fi has emerged as the key wireless technology for
	delivering media services in the connected home of smart devices. According to the Cisco Report, globally, in 2015, a smart device generated 14 times more traffic than a non-smart device, and by 2020 a smart device is estimated to generate nearly 23
	times more traffic. Furthermore, the Cisco Report also anticipates that smart device traffic will grow at a CAGR of 53% from 2015 to 2020.

	Wireless networking has also become mission-critical for businesses, schools, and governments to
	keep constituents connected. As more applications become cloud-enabled (meaning stored or run from servers in a data center), access to these services becomes even more ubiquitous. Municipalities have also begun to offer free Wi-Fi services to
	citizens in public access locations. Some of this public access Wi-Fi is also served by the larger telecom and cable carriers. As Wi-Fi standards have gone from 802.11b/g to 802.11n, and more recently 802.11ac, the ability to access standard and
	high definition video over Wi-Fi becomes meaningful and drives demand. Carriers have been challenged to meet the requirements of the new high-bandwidth video and data applications. With current high-performance Wi-Fi, carriers can eliminate video

	While we
	believe our embedded antenna solutions provide significant performance improvement over competing antenna products and meet the demand of today&#146;s market, the need for even better wireless coverage in home networks continues to grow. Wireless
	video offerings from service providers are becoming more commonplace, and next generation technologies require ever increasing data speeds, bandwidth and coverage to meet rising consumer expectations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There are basically two ways to improve the data transfer speed in wireless networks: improve the efficiency of encoding the data on the
	wireless carrier signal, or reduce the need to re-transmit data to make up for poor reception. Improving the encoding efficiency requires a change in the protocol standard, which occurred when the industry transitioned from 802.11b/g/a standard to
	the 802.11n standard, and continues to occur today, such as with the recent transition to the new 802.11ac standard. However, there remains a fundamental relationship between the quality of the wireless signal, and performance, and the amount of
	information any signal can carry.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To improve signal quality, we have developed our smart antenna technology, which serves as a very
	effective way to direct radio wave energy and point this focused energy in a chosen direction. This focused energy is then harnessed to improve data communication in wireless networks through a set of proprietary algorithms implemented in software
	and firmware that can greatly enhance the range and data throughput performance versus conventional solutions. All of the algorithms operate within the standardized protocols for 802.11 networks and are fully compatible with existing products on the
	market.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The improved antenna performance of our smart antenna system is based on combining the benefits of multiple antennas with
	self-adaptive automatic antenna switching. Our patented antenna tuning process is very rapid and is applied automatically both to receiving and transmitting functions. This same control method can be used with many different physical antenna
	configurations, and allows our antennas to achieve greater performance than conventional solutions. Our patented Smart Antenna technology is very effective at improving the signal quality of WLAN connections. These smart antennas are optimized to
	receive signals from single or multiple antenna element systems, dynamically and in real time selecting the optimal configuration maximizing the performance of any given data transmission.

	Our Smart Antenna switching algorithms can be applied to almost any type of antenna structure. Our Smart Antenna algorithms power intelligent
	switching between elements in multi-element antenna systems, however the technology can equally be applied to single element smart antenna systems whereby switching can be used to dynamically re-configure antenna patterns to maximize throughput and
	coverage for a given environment.

	As of September 30, 2016, we
	had approximately 38&nbsp;employees in the United States and 4 in the United Kingdom, 28 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development, 8 of whom were primarily engaged in sales and marketing and 6 of whom were primarily engaged in
	operations and general and administration functions. In addition, we also have 9&nbsp;employees based out of China whom primarily were engaged in sales and marketing. In addition, we contract directly with engineers and sales contractors
	domestically and internationally. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

	Our board of
	directors consists of seven members. Our board of directors has determined that Joan Gillman and Thomas A. Munro are independent directors in accordance with the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market. The NASDAQ independence definition
	includes a series of objective tests, including that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings
	with us. In addition, as required by NASDAQ rules, our board of directors has made a subjective determination as to each independent director that no relationships exist, which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the
	exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In making these determinations, our board of directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director&#146;s
	business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.

	Our
	board of directors is currently led by its chairman, Jim K. Sims. Our board of directors recognizes that it is important to determine an optimal board leadership structure to ensure the independent oversight of management as the company continues to
	grow. We separate the roles of chief executive officer and chairman of the board in recognition of the differences between the two roles. The chief executive officer is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the company and the
	day-to-day leadership and performance of the company, while the chairman of the board of directors provides guidance to the chief executive officer and presides over meetings of the full board of directors. We believe that this separation of
	responsibilities provides a balanced approach to managing the board of directors and overseeing the company.

	The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options, or ISOs, and nonqualified stock options, or NSOs,
	restricted stock, dividend equivalents, restricted stock units, or RSUs, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, and other stock or cash based awards. Certain awards under the 2016 Plan may constitute or provide for a deferral of compensation, subject
	to Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code, which may impose additional requirements on the terms and conditions of such awards. All awards under the 2016 Plan will be set forth in award agreements, which will detail the terms and conditions

<I>
	Stock Options
</I>
	. Stock options provide for the purchase of shares of our common stock in the future at an exercise price set on the grant
	date. ISOs, by contrast to NSOs, may provide tax deferral beyond exercise and favorable capital gains tax treatment to their holders if certain holding period and other requirements of the Internal Revenue Code are satisfied. The exercise price of a
	stock option will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying share on the date of grant (or 110% in the case of ISOs granted to certain significant stockholders), except with respect to certain substitute options granted in
	connection with a corporate transaction. The term of a stock option may not be longer than ten years (or five years in the case of ISOs granted to certain significant stockholders). Vesting conditions determined by the plan administrator may apply
	to stock options and may include continued service, performance and/or other conditions. ISOs generally may be granted only to our employees and employees of our parent or subsidiary corporations, if any.

	with a corporate transaction), and the term of a SAR may not be longer than ten years. Vesting conditions determined by the plan administrator may apply to SARs and may include continued service, performance and/or other conditions.

	. Restricted stock is an award of nontransferable shares of our common stock that remain forfeitable unless
	and until specified conditions are met, and which may be subject to a purchase price. RSUs are contractual promises to deliver shares of our common stock in the future, which may also remain forfeitable unless and until specified conditions are met
	and may be accompanied by the right to receive the equivalent value of dividends paid on shares of our common stock prior to the delivery of the underlying shares. Delivery of the shares underlying RSUs may be deferred under the terms of the award
	or at the election of the participant, if the plan administrator permits such a deferral. Conditions applicable to restricted stock and RSUs may be based on continuing service, the attainment of performance goals and/or such other conditions as the
	plan administrator may determine.

	Other stock or cash based awards are awards of cash, fully

	form in the settlement of other awards, as standalone payments and as payment in lieu of base salary, bonus, fees or other cash compensation otherwise payable to any individual who is eligible to receive awards. The plan administrator will determine

	of directors or its authorized committee may modify the non-employee director compensation program from time to time in the exercise of its business judgment, taking into account such factors, circumstances and considerations as it shall deem

	Stock Options and SARs
</I>
	. A 2016 Plan participant generally will not recognize taxable income and we generally will not be entitled to a
	tax deduction upon the grant of a stock option or SAR. The tax consequences of exercising a stock option and the subsequent disposition of the shares received upon exercise will depend upon whether the option qualifies as an ISO or an NSO. Upon
	exercising an NSO when the fair market value of our stock is higher than the exercise price of the option, a 2016 Plan participant generally will recognize taxable income at ordinary income tax rates equal to the excess of the fair market value of
	the stock on the date of exercise over the purchase price, and we (or our subsidiaries, if any) generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction for compensation expense, in the amount equal to the amount by which the fair market value of
	the shares purchased exceeds the purchase price for the shares. Upon a subsequent sale or other disposition of the option shares, the participant will recognize a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss in the amount of the difference between
	the sales price of the shares and the participant&#146;s tax basis in the shares.

	Our employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP if

	Grant of Rights.
</I>
	The ESPP is intended to qualify under Section&nbsp;423 of the Internal Revenue Code and stock will be offered under
	the ESPP during offering periods. The length of the offering periods under the ESPP is determined by the plan administrator and may be up to 27 months long. Employee payroll deductions are used to purchase shares on each purchase date during an
	offering period. The purchase dates for each offering period will be the final trading day in each offering period. Offering periods under the ESPP will commence when determined by the plan administrator. The plan administrator may, in its
	discretion, modify the terms of future offering periods.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through payroll
	deductions of up to 20% of their eligible compensation, which includes a participant&#146;s gross base compensation for services to us, including overtime payments and excluding sales commissions, incentive compensation, bonuses, expense
	reimbursements, fringe benefits and other special payments. The plan administrator may establish a maximum number of shares that may be purchased by a participant during any offering period, which, in the absence of a contrary designation, will be
	20,000 shares. In addition, no employee will be permitted to accrue the right to purchase stock under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $25,000 worth of shares during any calendar year during which such a purchase right is outstanding (based on the
	fair market value per share of our common stock as of the first day of the offering period).

	foregoing transactions or events or certain significant transactions, including a change in control, the plan administrator may provide for (1)&nbsp;either the replacement of outstanding rights with other rights or property or termination of
	outstanding rights in exchange for cash, (2)&nbsp;the assumption or substitution of outstanding rights by the successor or survivor corporation or parent or subsidiary thereof, if any, (3)&nbsp;the adjustment in the number and type of shares of

	The ESPP, and the right of participants to make purchases thereunder, is intended to qualify under the provisions of Section&nbsp;423 of the

	subject to tax in an amount that depends upon the length of time such shares are held by the participant prior to disposing of them. If the shares are sold or disposed of more than two years from the first day of the offering period during which the
	shares were purchased and more than one year from the date of purchase, or if the participant dies while holding the shares, the participant (or his or her estate) will recognize ordinary income measured as the lesser of: (1)&nbsp;the excess of the

	indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. There is no pending litigation or proceeding naming any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is being sought, nor are we aware of any pending or

	From 2010 through 2011, we sold to investors in private placements an aggregate of $3.0 million
	of convertible promissory notes, or the 2011 Notes, and 8,099,723 warrants to purchase shares of our Series G preferred redeemable convertible stock, or the 2011 Warrants. In June 2012, in accordance with the terms of the 2011 Notes, the principal

	automatic net exercise of the 2011 Warrants into shares of our common stock, and we issued an aggregate of 127,143 shares of our common stock in connection with such net exercise. The following table sets forth the aggregate number of 2011 Warrants

	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to close

	additional shares. If the underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by exercise of the option to purchase additional shares and, therefore, have a naked short position, the position can be closed out only by buying shares in the open

	The Company recognizes all employee stock-based
	compensation as a cost in the financial statements. Equity classified awards are measured at the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The impact of
	forfeitures that may occur prior to vesting is also estimated and considered in the amount recognized for all stock-based compensation. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
	Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015 was $657,730 and $341,554, respectively, for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2016 (unaudited) was $29,424 and $111,872 respectively, and for the

	Prior to the initial public offering the

	a written request from the holders of not less than 66&nbsp;2/3% of the then outstanding Senior Preferred Stock, all shares of the Senior Preferred Stock could be redeemed at the original issue price plus any accrued and unpaid dividends in two
	annual installments. At least one of the Company&#146;s two largest shareholders would have needed to vote in favor of redemption to meet the 66 2/3% requirement. The Company obtained written commitments from these two shareholders committing that
	neither shareholder would vote in favor of redemption prior to January&nbsp;1, 2018.

	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company
	had issued freestanding warrants exercisable to purchase shares of its Series G preferred redeemable convertible stock. These warrants were classified as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as the terms for redemption of the
	underlying security were outside the Company&#146;s control. The warrants were recorded at fair value using a combination of an option pricing model and current value model under the probability-weighted return method. The fair value of all warrants
	were remeasured at each balance sheet date with any changes in fair value being recognized in the statement of operations. In May 2016, the warrants were amended such that the warrants became immediately exercisable into shares of the Company&#146;s
	common stock. Concurrent with such amendment, the holders of the outstanding warrants elected to net exercise the warrants, and the Company issued an aggregate of 127,143&nbsp;shares of common stock.

	On December&nbsp;17, 2015, the Company executed and entered into an asset
	purchase agreement for certain North American assets of Skycross, Inc., a manufacturer of advanced antenna and radio-frequency solutions. As a result of the acquisition, the Company expects to benefit from the acquisition primarily through the
	addition of new customers. The goodwill of $1,249,956 arising from the acquisition relates to expected synergies and cost reductions through economies of scale. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is $1,249,956.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to the $4.0 million paid up front, the purchase price also includes a contingent consideration arrangement. The $1.0 million of
	deferred consideration is payable upon the later of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement between the Company and Skycross, Inc. which defines transition services to be provided by Skycross to the Company, and (ii)&nbsp;the
	date on which the Company has received copies of third party approvals with respect to each customer and program that was purchased. The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that could be required to be paid under the contingent
	consideration arrangement is between $0 and $1.0 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated by applying the income approach. The income approach is based on estimating the value of the present worth of future net cash
	flow.

	The fair value of accounts receivable is $429,267. The contingent consideration of $1.0&nbsp;million is

	Revenue associated with the acquired Skycross assets since the date of acquisition was $0.2&nbsp;million, $1.4&nbsp;million and
	$3.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited), respectively. Cost of goods sold associated with the acquired Skycross assets since the date of acquisition was
	$0.1&nbsp;million, $0.5 million and $1.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited), respectively. The acquired assets were not managed as a discrete business by the
	previous owner. Accordingly, the historical financial information for the assets acquired was impracticable to obtain, and inclusion of pro forma information would require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding these assets&#146;
	historical financial results that may not be reasonable or accurate. As a result, pro forma results are not presented. It is not practicable to determine net income included in the Company&#146;s operating results relating to Skycross assets since
	the date of acquisition because the assets have been fully integrated into the Company&#146;s operations, and the operating results of the Skycross assets can therefore not be separately identified.

	The net change in the total valuation allowance was a decrease of $2,085,328 and $1,375,356 in 2014 and 2015,
	respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
	dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback
	and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment.

	As the Series&nbsp;G Preferred Stock was redeemable at the option of the Series&nbsp;G preferred stockholders,
	the Company had determined the warrants for Series&nbsp;G Preferred Stock should be classified as liabilities and adjusted to fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using a combination of an option-pricing
	model and current value model under the probability-weighted return method, using significant unobservable inputs (Level&nbsp;3 inputs) including: management&#146;s cash flow projections; probability and timing of potential liquidity scenarios;
	weighted-average cost of capital that included the addition of a company specific risk premium to account for uncertainty associated with the Company achieving future cash flows; selection of appropriate market comparable transactions and multiples;
	expected volatility; and risk-free rate. The Company used a combination of discounted cash flow, guideline public company and market transaction valuation techniques in estimating the fair value of the warrant liability at each reporting date. The
	discount rates used were 19%, 21% and 20% at December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2015 and May 24, 2016 (unaudited), respectively. The fair value of the warrants was $809,974, $709,504 and $249,215 as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015 and May 24, 2016

	The grant-date fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the
	Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The weighted average assumptions for 2014 and 2015 grants and the grants for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited) are provided in the following table. The Company&#146;s lack of historical
	share option exercise experience does not provide it a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term because of a lack of sufficient data. Therefore, we estimate the expected term by using the simplified method, which calculates the
	expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. Since the Company&#146;s shares have only been publicly traded since August 12, 2016 and its shares were rarely traded privately, expected volatility is
	estimated based on the average historical volatility of similar entities with publicly traded shares. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of grant.

	subsection (a), (b)&nbsp;or (c)&nbsp;above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in

	materially prejudiced by such failure (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses). In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
	indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and
	after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of the indemnifying party&#146;s election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal
	or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that if, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, it is advisable for the
	Underwriters to be represented as a group by separate counsel, the Representatives shall have the right to employ a single counsel (in addition to local counsel) to represent all Underwriters who may be subject to liability arising from any claim in
	respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters under subsection (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying party or parties and reimbursed to
	the Underwriters as incurred. An indemnifying party shall not be obligated under any settlement agreement relating to any action under this Section&nbsp;6 to which it has not agreed in writing. In addition, no indemnifying party shall, without the
	prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified
	party for all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. Notwithstanding the
	foregoing, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6(d), such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable
	for any settlement effected without its written consent if (i)&nbsp;such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii)&nbsp;such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed
	such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.

	be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling
	Stockholders or the Underwriters and the parties&#146; relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that
	it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection&nbsp;(e) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which
	does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this subsection&nbsp;(e). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence
	of this subsection&nbsp;(e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this
	subsection&nbsp;(e). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection&nbsp;(e), (i)&nbsp;no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such
	Underwriter with respect to the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and (ii)&nbsp;the liability
	under this subsection (e)&nbsp;of each Selling Stockholder shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions, actually received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of Securities sold by such
	Selling Stockholder hereunder. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
	Underwriters&#146; obligations in this subsection (e)&nbsp;to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Selling Stockholders&#146; obligations in this subsection (e)&nbsp;to contribute are
	several in proportion to their respective net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions, actually received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Securities sold by the Selling Stockholders hereunder and not joint. The
	remedies provided for in this Section&nbsp;6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that might otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
