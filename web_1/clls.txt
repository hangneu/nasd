	calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense&#151;a non-cash expense, we
	believe that this financial measure, when considered together with our IFRS financial statements, can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis&#146; financial performance. Moreover, our management views the Company&#146;s operations, and
	manages its business, based, in part, on this financial measure. In particular, we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for
	period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis
	of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies, including companies in our industries which have similar Stock-based compensations, may address the impact of Non-cash stock-based compensation
	expense differently; and (b) other companies may report Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.
	Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our other IFRS financial results, including Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.

	We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis as our Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis, adjusted to eliminate the impact of Non-cash stock-based compensation
	expense. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based
	compensation expense a non-cash expense, we believe that this financial measure, when considered together with our IFRS financial statements, can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis&#146; financial performance. Moreover, our management
	views the Company&#146;s operations, and manages its business, based, in part, on this financial measure. Our use of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not
	consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Please refer below for a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to Net Income (Loss)

	We are an early-stage gene-editing company with a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical and agricultural biotechnology
	product development is a highly speculative endeavor. It entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and there is significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile,
	to gain regulatory approval or to become commercially viable. In our therapeutics business, we are focused on developing products using our gene-editing platform to develop genetically modified T-cells that express a CAR and are designed to target
	and kill cancer cells. While there have been significant advances in cell-based immunotherapy, our gene-editing platform and T-cell and CAR technologies are new and unproven. All of the product candidates that we are developing or co-developing are
	in pre-clinical stages or entering into a clinical stage (UCART19 for which a CTA has been filed), and we have not yet generated any revenue from product sales to date. In our agricultural biotechnology business, we are exploring the use of our
	gene-editing technologies to develop healthier food products for a growing population. Our plant products are in early stages of development, and we have not yet generated any revenues from sales of these plant products.

	Our limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. We have encountered, and will

	accuracy, determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, gaining market acceptance of our gene-editing platform, managing a complex regulatory landscape and developing new product candidates. Our current operating model may require
	changes in order for us to scale our operations efficiently. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we face as an early-stage company focused on developing products in the fields of immuno-oncology and

	through the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, obtaining public funding in support of innovation, reimbursements of research tax credit claims, and royalties on our licensed technology. During 2013 and 2014, we have received

	Pfizer and Servier. In addition, in March 2015, we completed our U.S. Initial Public Offering of 5,500,000 American Depositary Shares on the Nasdaq Global Market for gross proceeds of $228.3 million. Our research and development expenses for the
	years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015 were &#128;14.4 and &#128;52.4&nbsp;million, respectively. Our net loss for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015 was &#128;1.0&nbsp;million and &#128;20.4&nbsp;million, respectively.

	Servier will achieve these targets. Our other product candidates are in various stages of pre-clinical development and we have limited pre-clinical data evaluating many of these product candidates. Because of the early stage of development of our
	product candidates, we have not yet demonstrated the safety, specificity and clinical benefits of our product candidates in humans, and we cannot assure you that the results of any human trials will demonstrate the value and efficacy of our
	platform. Moreover, there are a number of regulatory requirements that we must satisfy before we can commence clinical trials in the United States and the European Union, or EU. Satisfaction of these requirements will entail substantial time, effort
	and financial resources. We may never satisfy these requirements. Any time, effort and financial resources we expend on our other early-stage product candidate development programs may adversely affect our ability to continue development and
	commercialization of our more advanced product candidates and we may never commence clinical trials of any product candidates despite expending significant resources in pursuit of their development. Even if we do commence clinical trials of our

	Because we are developing novel CAR T-cell immunotherapy product candidates that are
	unique biological entities, the regulatory requirements that we will be subject to are not entirely clear. Even with respect to more established products that fit into the categories of gene therapies or cell therapies, the regulatory landscape is
	still developing. For example, regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products and cell therapy products have changed frequently and will likely continue to change in the future. Moreover, there is substantial, and sometimes uncoordinated,
	overlap in those responsible for regulation of existing gene therapy products and cell therapy products. For example, in the United States, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics
	Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene therapy clinical trials are also subject to review
	and oversight by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at the institution participating in the clinical trial. Gene therapy clinical studies
	conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities&#146; Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee,
	or the RAC. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, review process and determinations of other reviewing bodies can impede or delay the initiation of a clinical study, even if the FDA has reviewed the study
	and approved its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can place an IND application on clinical hold even if such other entities have provided a favorable review. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent
	institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which a clinical trial will be conducted. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory
	bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates.

	Similarly complex regulatory environments exist in other
	jurisdictions in which we might consider seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates, further complicating the regulatory landscape. For example, in the EU a special committee called the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) was
	established within the EMA in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced-therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs, and to follow scientific developments in the field. ATMPs include gene
	therapy products as well as somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products. In this regard, on May&nbsp;28, 2014, the EMA issued a recommendation that Cellectis&#146; UCART19 be considered a gene therapy product under Regulation (EC)
	No 1394/2007 on ATMPs.

	These various regulatory review committees and advisory groups and new or revised guidelines that they promulgate
	from time to time may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of
	our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. Because the regulatory landscape for our CAR T-cell immunotherapy product candidates is new, we may face even more cumbersome and complex regulations than those
	emerging for gene therapy products and cell therapy products. Furthermore, even if our product candidates obtain required regulatory approvals, such approvals may later be withdrawn as a result of changes in regulations or the interpretation of
	regulations by applicable regulatory agencies.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory

	obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business.

	Our therapeutic product candidates will require substantial additional clinical development, testing, and regulatory approval before we are

	carry out their contractual duties or meet required performance standards or expected deadlines, we might be required to replace them or the data that they provide could be rejected by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory bodies, all of which

	To date, we have not completed
	pre-clinical testing for any of our product candidates, except UCART19, which has not yet commenced clinical trials. Pre-clinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and unpredictable processes that can be subject to extensive delays. We
	cannot guarantee that any pre-clinical studies or clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. It may take several years to complete the pre-clinical testing and clinical development necessary to commercialize a
	product candidate, and delays or failure can occur at any stage. Interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results, and success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials
	will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in earlier trials, and we cannot be certain
	that our product candidates will not face similar setbacks. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until
	the clinical trial is well advanced. An unfavorable outcome in one or more clinical trials would be a major setback for our product candidates and for us and may require us or our collaborators to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more
	product candidate development programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.

	The product candidates we
	develop will be subject to a complex, highly-regulated manufacturing process that will be subject to multiple risks. As a result of the complexities of this process, the cost to manufacture our CAR T-cell immunotherapy product will be generally
	higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the manufacturing process requires very minimal batch-to-batch variability, which is expensive to ensure. Our manufacturing process will be susceptible to product loss or failure due to
	logistical issues associated with the collection of white blood cells, or starting material, from healthy third-party donors, shipping such material to the manufacturing site, ensuring standardized production batch-to-batch in the context of mass
	production, freezing the manufactured product, shipping the final product globally, and infusing patients with the product. In addition, we may face manufacturing issues associated with interruptions in the manufacturing process, contamination,
	equipment or reagent failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in cell growth, and variability in product characteristics. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result
	in reduced production yields, product defects, and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral, or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such
	manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Further, as product candidates are developed through pre-clinical to late stage clinical trials towards approval and
	commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these
	intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Currently, the product candidates we develop are manufactured using processes appropriate for pre-clinical stage production by a third-party
	contract manufacturing organization, or CMO. Although we work with CMOs to ensure that commercially viable processes are available for mass production, there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or
	commercialization, including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-out, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency, and timely availability of reagents or raw materials. We may ultimately be unable to
	reduce the cost of goods for the product candidates to levels that will allow for an attractive return on investment if and when those product candidates are commercialized.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect our manufacturing strategy for the product candidates we develop will continue to involve the use of one or more CMOs as well as
	establishing our own capabilities and infrastructure, including a manufacturing facility. We expect that development of our own manufacturing facility will provide us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the
	commercial market, enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and allow for better long-term margins. However, we have no experience as a company in developing a manufacturing facility and may never be successful in developing our own
	manufacturing facility or capability. We may establish multiple manufacturing facilities as we expand our commercial footprint to multiple geographies, which may lead to regulatory delays or prove costly. Even if we are successful, our manufacturing
	capabilities could be affected by cost-overruns, unexpected delays, equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures, regulatory issues and numerous other factors that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of
	our manufacturing strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business.

	In addition, the manufacturing process for any products
	that we may develop is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval processes for the jurisdictions in which we or our collaborators will seek marketing approval for commercialization, and we will need to contract with manufacturers who
	can meet all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. If the manufacturing process is changed during the course of product development, FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could require us to repeat some or
	all previously conducted trials or conduct additional bridging trials, which could delay or impede our ability to obtain marketing approval. If we or our CMOs are unable to reliably produce product candidates or products to specifications acceptable
	to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, such as the FDA&#146;s cGMP standards compliance, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we need to further develop, conduct clinical trials for, and commercialize such products in the relevant

	Our gene-editing technologies are novel. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene editing is unsafe, and products incorporating
	gene editing may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians specializing in our targeted diseases prescribing our product candidates as treatments in lieu of, or in addition
	to, existing, more familiar, treatments for which greater clinical data may be available. Any increase in negative perceptions of gene editing may result in fewer physicians prescribing our treatments or may reduce the willingness of patients to
	utilize our treatments or participate in clinical trials for our product candidates. Increased negative public opinion, or more restrictive government regulations in response thereto, would have a negative effect on our business or financial
	condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for such product candidates. For example, in 2003, 20 subjects treated for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency in two gene therapy
	studies using a murine gamma-retroviral vector, a viral delivery system, showed correction of the disease, but the studies were terminated after five subjects developed leukemia. Although none of our current product candidates utilize these
	gamma-retroviruses, our product candidates use a viral delivery system. Adverse events in clinical studies for the product candidates we develop or those of our competitors, even if not ultimately attributable to our or their product candidates,
	respectively (such as the many adverse events that typically arise from the transplant process), and any resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing

	Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical studies of the product
	candidates we develop is critical to our success. The timing of these clinical studies will depend, in part, on the speed of recruitment of patients to participate in testing such product candidates as well as completion of required follow-up
	periods. We or our collaborators may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to complete the clinical studies for our product
	candidates in a timely manner. If patients are unwilling to participate in such studies because of negative publicity from adverse events in the biotechnology or gene or cell therapy industries or for other reasons, the timeline for recruiting
	patients, conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product candidates, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or
	termination of the clinical studies altogether.

	In addition, clinical trials for the product candidates we develop will compete with
	other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition may reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in
	our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Because the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of the clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some
	of our competitors use, which may reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites. Moreover, because the product candidates we develop represent a departure from more commonly used methods for
	cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy and stem cell transplants, rather than enroll patients in our future clinical trial or clinical trial of our collaborators.

	regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, and submission of safety and other post-market information. Any regulatory approvals received for the product candidates may
	also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and
	surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. For example, the holder of an approved BLA in the United States is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the BLA. FDA
	guidance advises that patients treated with some types of gene therapy undergo follow-up observations for potential adverse events for as long as 15 years. Similarly, in the EU, pharmacovigilance obligations are applicable to all medicinal products.
	In addition to those, holders of a marketing authorization for gene or cell therapy products must detail, in their application, the measures they envisage to ensure follow-up of the efficacy and safety of these products. In cases of particular
	concern, marketing authorization holders for gene or cell therapy products in the EU may be required to design a risk management system with a view to identifying, preventing or minimizing risks, and may be obliged to carry out post-marketing
	studies. In the United States, the holder of an approved BLA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Similar provisions apply
	in the EU. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. Similarly, in the EU any promotion of medicinal products is highly
	regulated and, depending on the specific jurisdiction involved, may require prior vetting by the competent national regulatory authority.

	from being marketed outside of the jurisdictions in which regulatory approvals have been received. In order to market and sell the product candidates in the EU and many other jurisdictions, we and our collaborators must obtain separate marketing

	We
	plan to seek orphan drug designation for some or all of our product candidates in specific orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for the use of these products. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan
	designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United
	States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be
	requested before submitting a BLA. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. After the FDA
	grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval
	process. Although we intend to seek orphan product designation for some or all of our product candidates, we may never receive such designations.

	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease
	for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except
	in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan product exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient
	quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Even if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for
	any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. Exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated
	indication and may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or
	condition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be

	Similarly, in Europe, a medicinal product may receive orphan designation under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000. This applies to products
	that are intended for a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition and either (a)&nbsp;such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b)&nbsp;the product, without the benefits
	derived from orphan status, would unlikely generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment. Moreover, in order to obtain orphan designation in the EU it is necessary to demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of

	In the EU, orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and applicants can benefit
	from specific regulatory assistance and scientific advice. Products receiving orphan designation in the EU can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the
	market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies (Article 37, Regulation 1901/2006). However, the 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the
	fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation&#151;for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization

	In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions,
	there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our or our collaborators&#146; ability to sell our products profitably. By way of example, in the United States, the Patient Protection and
	Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA) was enacted in March 2010 and is expected to have a significant impact on the provision of, and payment for, health care in the United
	States. The ACA was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance
	industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.

	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to
	Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was
	signed into law which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additional
	legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States, could influence the purchase of medicines and reduce demand and prices for our products, if approved.
	This could harm our or our collaborators&#146; ability to market any products and generate revenues. Cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and the effect of further healthcare reform could significantly
	reduce potential revenues from the sale of any of our product candidates approved in the future, and could cause an increase in our compliance, manufacturing, or other operating expenses.

	In some countries, the proposed pricing for a biopharmaceutical product must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. In addition, in
	certain foreign markets, the pricing of biopharmaceutical product is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU
	provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve
	a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price
	controls or reimbursement limitations for biopharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, biopharmaceutical products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of
	the United States and generally tend to have significantly lower prices.

	compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP. The FDA&#146;s cGMP regulations and comparable regulations in other jurisdictions govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of
	quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes
	in the properties or stability of the product candidates we develop that may not be detectable in final product testing. In the United States, we or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA on a timely
	basis and must adhere to the FDA&#146;s cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must
	pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility
	involved with the preparation of our product candidates or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, FDA approval

	Similarly, in the EU, Directive 2003/94/EC lays down the principles and guidelines of GMP in

	In the EU, genetically modified foods, or GM foods, can only be allowed on the market once they have been authorized subject to rigorous
	safety assessments. The procedures for evaluation and authorization of GM foods are governed by Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 on GM food and feed and Directive 2001/18/EC on the release of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, into the environment.
	If the GMO is not to be used in food or feed, then an application must be made under Directive 2001/18/EC. If the GMO is to be used in food or feed (but it is not grown in the EU) then a single application for both food and feed purposes under
	Regulation 1829/2003 should be made. If the GMO is used in feed or food and it is also grown in the EU, an application for both cultivation and food/feed purposes needs to be carried out under Regulation (EC) 1829/2003. A different EU regulation,
	Regulation (EC) 1830/2003, regulates the labeling of products that contain GMOs that are placed on the EU market. There are currently legislative proposals in the EU that would allow EU Member States to restrict or prohibit growing GMOs in their

	The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of significant changes
	to U.S. patent law. These changes include a transition from a &#147;first-to-invent&#148; system to a &#147;first-to-file&#148; system, changes to the way issued patents are challenged, and changes to the way patent applications are disputed during
	the examination process. As a result of these changes, the patent law in the United States may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed
	new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act, and, in particular, the first-to-file provisions
	became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act may affect our ability to obtain patents, and if obtained, to enforce or defend them. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any,
	impact the America Invents Act will have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications and our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and to enforce or defend any patents that may issue from our patent applications, all of which

	In addition to patent protection, because we operate in the highly technical field of

	assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all
	confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party&#146;s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering

	The laws of some foreign
	countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain
	outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. In addition, the legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do
	not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to biopharmaceuticals or biotechnologies. As a result, many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending
	intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. Such issues may make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many
	foreign countries, including the EU countries, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including
	government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to
	grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensors&#146; efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the
	world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.

	Furthermore,

	Our current strategy does not involve plans to acquire companies or technologies facilitating or enabling us to access to new
	medicines, new technologies, new research projects, or new geographical areas, or enabling us to express synergies with our existing operations. However, if such acquisitions were to become necessary or attractive in the future, we may not be able
	to identify appropriate targets or make acquisitions under satisfactory conditions, in particular, satisfactory price conditions. In addition, we may unable to obtain the financing for these acquisitions under favorable conditions, and could be led
	to finance these acquisitions using cash that could be allocated to other purposes in the context of existing operations. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such
	businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or
	acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction, which could have a
	material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, earnings and prospects.

	As a U.S. public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other
	expenses. We are subject to the Exchange Act, including the reporting requirements thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Nasdaq listing requirements and other applicable securities
	rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations results in substantial legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources.
	These costs and other impacts will likely increase, particularly after we are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; and/or a foreign private issuer. For example, although we intend to continue to provide quarterly interim consolidated
	financial data to the SEC, for so long as we remain a foreign private issuer, we are not required to file with the SEC quarterly reports with respect to our business and results of operations that are required to be made by domestic issuers.

	Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section&nbsp;404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on
	our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we are not
	be required to include this attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. When our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of
	our internal control over financial reporting, the cost of complying with Section&nbsp;404 will significantly increase and management&#146;s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and
	results of operations. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will further increase our cost and expense. If we fail to implement the requirements of Section&nbsp;404
	of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the required timeframe, we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including the SEC and the Nasdaq. Furthermore, if we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial
	reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities. Failure to implement or maintain effective
	internal control systems required of public companies could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.

	A non-U.S. corporation will be considered a passive foreign investment company,
	or PFIC, for any taxable year if either (1)&nbsp;at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (2)&nbsp;at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during such year) is
	attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. Based on the value and composition of our assets, although not free from doubt, we believe that we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the 2015
	taxable year. The determination of PFIC status is fact-specific, and a separate determination must be made each taxable year as to whether we are a PFIC (after the close of each such taxable year). If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which
	a U.S. holder (as defined in the section titled &#147;Taxation&#151;Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&#148; in this Annual Report) holds ADSs, the U.S. holder may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including (1)&nbsp;the treatment

	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our share capital and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We
	currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs are not likely to receive any dividends for the foreseeable future and any increase in value will depend solely upon any
	future appreciation. Consequently, holders of our equity securities may need to sell all or part of their holdings after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains.

	originally instituted outside of the United States. Foreign courts may refuse to hear a U.S. securities law claim because foreign courts may not be the most appropriate forums in which to bring
	such a claim. Even if a foreign court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides, and not U.S. law, is applicable to the claim. Further, if U.S. law is found to be applicable, the
	content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process, and certain matters of procedure would still be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides. In particular,
	there is some doubt as to whether French courts would recognize and enforce certain civil liabilities under U.S. securities laws in original actions or judgments of U.S. courts based upon these civil liability provisions. In addition, awards of
	punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in France. An award for monetary damages under the U.S. securities laws would be considered punitive if it does not seek to compensate the claimant for loss
	or damage suffered but is intended to punish the defendant. French law provides that a shareholder, or a group of shareholders, may initiate a legal action to seek indemnification from the directors of a corporation in the corporation&#146;s
	interest if it fails to bring such legal action itself. If so, any damages awarded by the court are paid to the corporation and any legal fees relating to such action are borne by the relevant shareholder or the group of shareholders.

	We are a pioneering gene-editing company, employing our core
	proprietary technologies to develop best-in-class products in the emerging field of immuno-oncology. Our product candidates, based on gene-edited T-cells that express chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, seek to harness the power of the immune
	system to target and eradicate cancer cells. We believe that CAR-based immunotherapy is one of the most promising areas of cancer research, representing a new paradigm for cancer treatment. We are designing next-generation immunotherapies that are
	based on gene-edited CAR T-cells. Our gene-editing technologies allow us to create allogeneic CAR T-cells, meaning they are derived from healthy donors rather than the patients themselves. We believe that the production of allogeneic CAR T-cells
	will allow us to develop cost-effective, off-the-shelf products that are capable of being cryopreserved, stored and distributed worldwide. Our gene-editing expertise also enables us to develop product candidates that feature additional safety and
	efficacy attributes, including control properties designed to prevent them from attacking healthy tissues, to enable them to tolerate standard oncology treatments, and to equip them to resist mechanisms that inhibit immune-system activity. In
	addition to our focus on immuno-oncology, we are exploring the use of our gene-editing technologies in other therapeutic applications, as well as to develop healthier food products for a growing population.

	Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for one in four deaths. Immuno-oncology seeks to harness the
	power of the body&#146;s immune system to target and kill cancer. A key to this effort is a type of white blood cell known as the T-cell, which plays an important role in identifying and killing cancer cells. Unfortunately, cancer cells often
	develop mechanisms to evade the immune system. CARs, which are engineered receptors that can be expressed on the surface of the T-cell, provide the T-cell with a specific targeting mechanism, thereby enhancing its ability to seek, identify, interact
	with and destroy tumor cells bearing a selected antigen. Research and development of CAR T-cell immunotherapies currently focuses on two approaches: autologous and allogeneic therapies. Autologous CAR T-cell immunotherapies modify a patient&#146;s
	own T-cells to target specific antigens that are located on cancer cells. This type of therapy requires an individualized immunotherapy product for each patient and is currently being tested in clinical trials by several academic institutions,
	biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. In contrast, an allogeneic CAR T-cell immunotherapy is an approach by which a cancer patient is infused with a mass-produced, off-the-shelf immunotherapy product derived from a healthy T-cell donor. Our
	initial focus is on developing allogeneic treatments, and we believe that we are the leading company pursuing this approach.

	Gene editing is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted, repaired or
	replaced from a precise location in the genome. The most fundamental challenge of gene editing is the need to specifically and efficiently target a precise DNA sequence within a gene. Our proprietary nuclease-based gene-editing technologies,
	combined with 16 years of genome engineering experience, allow us to edit any gene with highly precise insertion, deletion, repair and replacement of DNA sequences. Our nucleases, including a particular class of proteins derived from transcription
	activator-like effectors act like DNA scissors to edit genes at precise target sites and allow us to design allogeneic CAR T-cells. Our patented PulseAgile electroporation technology allows us to efficiently deliver our clinical grade nucleases into

	In February 2014, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Servier to develop and commercialize certain product candidates.
	Pursuant to the agreement, Servier made an upfront payment of &#128;7.55&nbsp;million ($8.2 million). In addition, the strategic alliance, as amended in November 2015, provides for aggregate additional payments of up to &#128;895.0&nbsp;million
	($974.0 million), comprising payments upon the exercise of each option granted to Servier and payments upon the occurrence of certain specified development and commercial milestones. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging in the
	high single-digit percentages based on annual net sales of commercialized products. This agreement covers the development and the potential commercialization of the lead product candidate, UCART19, as well as other product candidates directed at
	four targets. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for the research and development of certain product candidates through the end of Phase 1 clinical trials. We granted Servier an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive,
	worldwide license on a product candidate-by-product candidate basis, with respect to each target selected by Servier and developed under the agreement, to further develop, manufacture and commercialize such product in the field of anti-tumor
	adoptive immunotherapy. Upon exercising each such option, Servier will assume responsibility for the further clinical development, manufacture and commercialization of the relevant product candidate. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to
	our initial collaboration agreement with Servier, which allowed for an early exercise of Servier&#146;s option with respect to UCART19 and other product candidates. Pursuant to this amendment, Servier has exercised its option to acquire the
	exclusive worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize UCART19. In addition, Pfizer and Servier have announced that they have entered into an exclusive global license and collaboration agreement to co-develop and commercialize UCART19.

	In June 2014, we entered into a global strategic collaboration agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which we will collaborate to conduct discovery
	and pre-clinical development activities to generate CAR T-cells directed at targets selected by Pfizer or us in the field of oncology. Pursuant to the agreement, Pfizer made an upfront, non-refundable $80.0 million payment to us, concurrent with
	Pfizer&#146;s equity investment in our Company. In addition, the strategic alliance provides for up to $2.8 billion in potential clinical and commercial milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging in the high
	single-digit percentages based on annual net sales of commercialized products. We may also receive funding for research and development costs associated with the Pfizer-selected targets and for four Cellectis-selected targets within the alliance.
	Pfizer has exclusive rights to pursue development and commercialization of products for a total of 15 targets of their choice. In addition, in November 2015 Pfizer and Servier announced that they had entered into an exclusive global license and
	collaboration agreement to co-develop and commercialize UCART19. According to their announcement, Pfizer and Servier would work together on a joint clinical development program for UCART19 and share development costs. Pfizer will be responsible for

	Immunotherapy: Turning the Immune System into &#147;Smart Drugs&#148;

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The immune system has evolved to protect the body from invading pathogens or external harmful materials by identifying these foreign bodies
	through &#147;non-self&#148; antigens, which are molecular signatures that they carry and are foreign to the body. A central function of the immune system is to discriminate between &#147;self,&#148; which is recognized through antigens normally
	present in the body and borne by cells, proteins, sugars or lipids, and non-self, which is detected through abnormal or foreign antigens. Cancer cells thrive, in part, because they trick the immune system into treating them as self, even though they
	express abnormal antigens, and thus immune tolerance occurs when the immune system fails to recognize and attack tumors. Breaking immune tolerance is an important aspect of most immuno-oncology-based therapeutics because it enables the immune system
	to recognize and treat tumors as non-self and lead to tumor destruction.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The immune system recognizes non-self danger signals and
	responds to threats at a cellular level. The immune system may be conceptualized as comprising two arms. The first arm, known as the innate immune system, recognizes non-specific signals of infection or abnormalities as a first line of defense. The
	innate immune system is the initial response to an infection, and the response is the same every time regardless of prior exposure to the infectious agent. The second arm, known as the adaptive immune system, is composed of highly specialized cells
	and provides long-term specific recognition and protection from infectious agents and abnormal processes such as cancer. The adaptive immune response is further subdivided into antibody-based responses and cellular responses, which include
	T-cell-based immune responses. The most significant components of the cellular aspect of the adaptive immune response are T-cells, which are specialized cells that generally mature in the thymus. T-cells are involved in both sensing and killing
	infected or abnormal cells, as well as coordinating the activation of other cells and mounting an immune response.

	Although the immune
	system is designed to identify and destroy foreign or abnormal protein-bearing tumor cells, this process is often defective in cancer patients. Additionally, cancer cells employ a number of mechanisms to escape immune detection and attack to
	suppress the effect of the immune response.

	Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that modifies, stimulates, or re-directs certain parts
	of the immune system to fight diseases, such as cancer. Immunotherapy works by stimulating a patient&#146;s own immune system or by turning its attacks towards harmful targets, such as cancer cells. Immunotherapy can also be pursued by giving
	patients engineered immune cells, such as CAR T-cells to target certain cells. Immunotherapy is playing an increasingly large role in treating cancer, chronic infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and allergic diseases.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	T-cells are a class of white blood cells that carry a specific TCR at their surface, that allows them to recognize and kill other cells that
	express antigens foreign to the individual. Normal cells express a set of specific molecules, called human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, at their surface. HLA is associated with small fragments, or peptides of the proteins expressed or processed inside
	the cell. Abnormal or foreign proteins expressed in a cell (viruses, for example) can attach to HLAs at the cell&#146;s surface and be recognized by T-cells through these HLA-peptide complexes and identified as foreign antigens. This recognition
	triggers the activation of the T-cells, which destroy the foreign HLA-peptide complex-bearing cell, secrete specific hormones attracting other immune-competent cells to their location, and start multiplying to establish a full immune response.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An activated T-cell can multiply tens of thousands of times, so long as there remains a presence of the foreign antigen in the body. Unlike
	antibodies that mainly diffuse passively through the body and its circulating fluids, T-cells actively leave blood vessels or lymphoid organs and travel through the tissues of the body where they can attack foreign antigens. Once the antigen is
	eliminated from the body, the T-cells run out of stimulation and die off, with only a fraction surviving as &#147;memory T-cells,&#148; which can react promptly should the antigen reappear in the body.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is a high variability of HLA molecules in the population. Therefore, if a cell is introduced into a person and originally comes from
	another individual that is not HLA-matched, it will bear, at its surface, HLA-peptide complexes that are recognized as foreign and will be killed by the T-cells of the recipient. This mechanism of graft rejection has been a major limitation to
	transplanting patients with allogeneic tissues. Reciprocally, if T-cells are grafted from one individual to another and start recognizing as foreign the normal HLA-peptide complexes at the surface of all tissues of the grafted individual, then they
	may attack and kill those healthy tissues, leading to Graft-versus-Host disease (GvHD), which can be very severe, and potentially fatal, if left untreated. GvHD has been a major limitation to the use of allogeneic T-cells when treating patients.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cancerous cells express abnormal antigens and can be killed by T-cells. However, cancer may grow and spread to various organs when
	T-cells with cancer-specific receptors are in low numbers, of poor quality, or rendered inactive by suppressive mechanisms employed by tumor tissues. T-cells are a key armament when fighting cancers. They play a particularly significant role if they
	are tailored to target tumors, and even more so if their genes are edited to overcome tumor defenses, to make T-cells compatible with other anti-cancer drugs that can be combined with them, and to prevent GvHD, which would allow the use of
	allogeneic T-cells.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CARs are engineered molecules that, when present at the surface of T-cells, enable them to recognize specific proteins or antigens that are
	present on the surface of other cells. These receptors are typically used to graft the specificity of an antibody derived from a single cell, or a monoclonal antibody, onto a T-cell and provide it with a specific targeting mechanism to seek,
	identify, interact with and destroy the tumor cells bearing a selected antigen associated with that tumor also known as tumor-associated antigen, or TAA and tumor-specific antigens, or TSA. The expression of some genes, or combinations of genes, can
	be associated with certain classes of cancers. It is sometimes possible to identify TAAs that are expressed at various levels by tumor cells from a given cancer type. These TAAs may also be normally expressed by other tissues at different stages of
	development.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	T-cells with CARs are referred to as CAR T-cells. Whereas natural T-cell receptors, or TCRs, only recognize antigens bound
	to an HLA molecule at a cell&#146;s surface, a CAR is able to directly recognize antigens that are present at the targeted cell&#146;s surface. It is believed that upon cell-to-cell contact between a CAR T-cell and an antigen-bearing targeted cell,
	antigen recognition by the CAR &#147;activates&#148; the CAR T-cell, triggering it to multiply, attack and kill its target through the release of &#147;hole-forming&#148; proteins, known as perforins, and &#147;degradation enzymes,&#148; known as
	granzymes, that enter the targeted cell through the perforin-formed holes and carry out the killing. The activation of a T-cell through a CAR results in a target-associated &#147;kill and amplify&#148; chain reaction that eradicates the tumor.

	In order to perform gene editing, we use our proprietary PulseAgile electroporation technology to introduce nucleases inside the target T-cell

	molecules are rapidly degraded by the cell, which means that the nuclease is only expressed for a short time.

	particularly effective due to the shape of the electrical field that includes high voltage peaks, which are optimized to create transient holes in the cell membrane, followed by lower voltage pulses that help mRNA (for example TALEN encoding mRNA)
	migrate into the cells. In addition, PulseAgile is optimized to preserve high cell viability and thus suited for large-scale manufacturing.

	Next-Generation Products Based on Multi-chain CAR
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Historically, CAR components have been assembled into a linear CAR molecule, known as a &#147;single-chain&#148; CAR. We have developed another
	architecture, which we call &#147;multi-chain&#148; CAR, that is currently based on the structure of the high-affinity IgE receptor, which is normally absent in T-cells. The multi-chain CAR is composed of several membrane-bound proteins that
	naturally assemble at the cell&#146;s surface and, as described below, have several benefits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CAR architectures generally utilize a
	single polypeptide chain, which requires multiple appending of domains to enable a configuration that provides both the T-cell activation and co-stimulation needed for optimal T-cell responses. Typically, the target-binding domain of a CAR consists
	of a single-chain variable fragment of an antibody comprising variable domains of large polypeptide subunits, or heavy chains, and small polypeptide subunits, or light chains, joined by a short linker peptide. This structure allows the expression of
	the CAR as a single-chain protein. One limitation of single-chain CAR architecture is the small number of features that it is able to add to a cell. With single-chain CARs, each additional feature, or domain, has to hinge on the transmembrane
	structure. As a result, single-chain CARs are structured so that as domains are added, they are inevitably located further away from the transmembrane structure. When such protein domains are not located close to the transmembrane structure, they
	tend to be less stable or active, which limits the number of domains that can be added.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have developed a novel multi-subunit CAR
	architecture that overcomes these structural issues and expands the functional possibilities that can be brought to a T-cell. Our multi-chain CAR is currently based on the architecture of a specific high affinity antibody receptor, IgE, that is
	normally absent from T-cells. This architecture offers the potential for inclusion of multiple intra-cellular signaling domains, optimally located at their natural distance from the membrane. In other words, our multi-chain CAR offers additional
	positions close to the cell membrane so that domains can be more flexibly located relative to the cell&#146;s transmembrane structure. This also facilitates the potential implementation of multiple recognition domains, possibly allowing the
	recognition of not only a single antigen, but also of patterns of multiple antigen expression. This novel multi-subunit architecture would allow the construction of CARs with both improved activity and specificity and thus an expanded range of
	applications.

	CARs, whether single or multi-chain, are means to redirect T-cell activity toward cells bearing selected antigens. Our

	In the
	first round, genetic material is added to the T-cell&#146;s genome using a viral vector&#151;a benign modified virus that cannot replicate autonomously but can efficiently deliver such genetic material into a cell with which it is in contact. In
	particular, we use replication-deficient viral vectors derived from a specific type of virus, known as lentivirus, to establish integration. The genetic material added includes a gene-coding for a CAR, which becomes a new receptor at the
	T-cell&#146;s surface that allows it to recognize and bind to a target molecule that is present at the surface of other cells. At this stage, we can also add additional genes to these cells that confer specific properties. For example, we add
	suicide genes, which code for proteins that can make T-cells susceptible to certain drugs and enable us to deplete our engineered T-cells at our discretion by administering a drug to the patient. This system can also be integrated within the CAR
	itself.

	treatments. For example, we inactivate the CD52 gene, which codes for the target of alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody sometimes used in CLL patients, that would otherwise destroy our engineered T-cells. Likewise, we believe we can inactivate the
	deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) genes in order to make our T-cells respectively resistant to purine nucleotide analogs (e.g.fludarabine, clfarabine or cytarabine) or to corticoids that are used for several types of cancer

	2015. The median age at diagnosis for ALL is 14 years with 58.8% of patients diagnosed at younger than 20 years of age. In contrast, 25.5% of cases are diagnosed at 45 years or older and only approximately 11% of patients are diagnosed at 65 years
	or older. ALL represents 75% to 80% of acute leukemia among children, making it the most common form of childhood leukemia; by contrast, ALL represents approximately 20% of all leukemia among adults. The cure rates and survival outcomes for patients
	with ALL have improved dramatically over the past several decades, primarily among children. Improvements are largely owed to advances in the understanding of the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of the disease, the incorporation of risk-adapted
	therapy, and the advent of new targeted agents. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database have shown a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 86% to 89% for children. Adults have the poorest 5-year OS rate of 24.1% for
	patients between the ages of 40 and 59 years and an even lower rate of 17.7% for patients between the ages of 60 and 69 years. Despite great progress in the development of curative therapies, ALL remains a leading cause of pediatric cancer-related
	mortality for patients presenting with a relapsed or refractory disease. New therapies are needed to overcome chemotherapy resistance and reduce non-specific treatment associated side effects.

	CLL is a chronic disease of the blood that develops slowly and is characterized by an excess of white blood cells. In healthy individuals,
	B-lymphocytes produced by the bone marrow are replaced in a few days. In the case of chronic lymphoid leukemia, the B-lymphocytes produced by the bone marrow accumulate in the blood, the ganglia, the spleen and the bone marrow, instead of dying
	within a few days or months to be replaced by others. Prognosis depends on the disease stage at diagnosis as well as the presence or absence of high-risk markers. CLL is the most common leukemia in the developed countries (approximately one-third of
	all new leukemia cases) with an incidence of four cases per 100,000 people per year. CLL primarily affects the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of approximately 70 years. Efforts by competitors are ongoing to develop CAR adoptive
	immunotherapies for CLL and ALL through autologous approaches. The initial results in a recently published CAR clinical trial are very encouraging.

	In vitro studies demonstrated efficient killing of human CD19-bearing cells by UCART19. Animal

	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a form of cancer that is characterized by infiltration of the bone marrow, blood, and other tissues by
	proliferative, clonal, abnormally and/or poorly differentiated cells of the hematopoietic system called blast cells. These cells interfere with normal hematopoiesis, thus contributing to the bone marrow failure which is the most common underlying
	cause of death. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults and has an annual overall incidence of 3.8 cases per 100,000 in the US and Europe. Although it can occur in children and adults, AML is primarily a disease of the elderly, with
	an incidence of 15 cases per 100,000 for those over 60 and a median age of patients with AML of 67 years. While complete response rates can be as high as 80% in patients undergoing initial induction cytotoxic chemotherapy, the majority of AML
	patients will ultimately be diagnosed with relapsed or refractory disease with a poor prognosis. The outcome in older patients who are unable to receive intensive chemotherapy without unacceptable side effects remains dismal, with a median survival
	of only 5 to 10 months. CD 123 is highly expressed on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) leukemic stem cells and blast cells, as well as in other hematologic malignancies, and constitutes an attractive target for AML.

	Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare and aggressive hematological neoplasm recently classified among AML in the 2008
	World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematologic malignancies. BPDCN is a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by the clonal proliferation of precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. There are no formal studies on the
	incidence of BPDCN in the general population. The few available data reported indicate that its overall incidence is extremely low, accounting for 0.44% of all hematologic malignancies and 0.7% of cutaneous lymphomas. Moreover, the leukemic form of
	disease is a rare phenomenon, representing &lt;1% of cases of acute leukemia. The disease may occur at any age, but most patients are elderly men who present with skin lesions and/or involved lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. Given its rarity
	and only recent recognition as a distinct clinico-pathological entity, no standardized therapeutic approach has been established for BPDCN and the optimal therapy remains to be defined. Although transient responses are seen to combination
	chemotherapy regimens used to treat acute leukemia or lymphoma, most patients relapse with drug-resistant disease with a median overall survival rate of 9 to 13 months, irrespective of the initial presentation of the disease. High CD123 surface
	expression is observed on BPDCN tumoral cells and therefore represents a rational target for therapeutic development in this rare disease.

	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell malignant neoplasm that is characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of a single clone of
	plasma cells producing a monoclonal immunoglobulin. This clone of plasma cells proliferates in the bone marrow and often results in extensive skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions, osteopenia, and/or pathologic fractures. Additional
	disease-related complications include hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and infections. MM accounts for approximately 10% of hematologic malignant disorders. The annual incidence, age-adjusted to the US population, is 4.3&nbsp;per 100,000,
	resulting in over 20,000 new patients in the United States each year. The median age at onset is 66 years, and only 2% of patients are younger than 40 years of age at diagnosis. Nine drugs have been approved over the past fifteen years for the
	treatment of MM, substantially expanding the number of treatment regimens available for patients in all stages of the disease. In the last decade, survival of multiple myeloma (MM) patients has markedly improved with a median survival of
	approximately 5 to 7 years but with major variation depending on host factors, stage of the disease, cytogenetic abnormalities, and response to therapy. However, despite this progress, patients with disease refractory to both immunomodulatory drugs
	(IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors have a median overall survival (OS) of only 9 months. CS1 (also known as SLAMF7) is a member of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family is highly and nearly universally expressed on MM cells.

	UCART38 is an allogeneic T-cell drug candidate intended for the treatment of CD38-expressing hematologic malignancies. UCART38 is designed to
	become active, proliferate, secrete cytokines and kill CD38 expressing cells. As CD38 is expressed on the cell surface of T-cells, CD38 will be inactivated in T-cells prior to transduction with a viral vector encoding an anti-CD38 CAR. The
	inactivation of CD38 may improve the production and activity of UCART38 by preserving T-cell population. In addition, as with all UCART products, UCART38 lacks the TCR and is intended to be used in an allogeneic context.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The underlying process of targeted gene editing using plant nucleases is no different than the process we apply to human organisms and cells.
	We seek to create a sequence-specific DNA break in a gene-of-interest and allow the cell&#146;s natural repair machinery to create a stable change at that location in the genome. The resulting changes can precisely alter certain genes to remove
	potentially harmful proteins or to confer specific traits.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Plant breeders have been crossbreeding varieties and selecting advantageous
	traits for thousands of years. The aim of targeted gene editing is to simply speed up that process by incorporating changes into elite germplasm known from wild ancestors or from other species altogether, to produce the best possible attributes
	faster and more cheaply. This gene-editing approach is more predictable, more reliable, and more effective than current techniques. Calyxt is applying our plant gene-editing platform to a broad range of horticultural and agronomic plant species.
	Calyxt performs transient expression of nucleases into a single-cell protoplast system by proprietary transformation technologies to allow precise gene editing, while avoiding the presence of foreign DNA in the final product. Following the
	completion of this gene-editing step, the modified plant single cell is re-grown into a fully functional plant and multiplied. The creation of these new varieties is already applicable to a wide range of crop families.

	Following 20 years of

	number of companies is also due in part to the high costs associated with product development and regulatory approval, which limit the capacity of small players to grow. Published data from industry sources indicate that the development of biotech
	plants takes 13 years and costs

	We aim to create food products with consumer health benefits by leveraging our plant-engineering platform and the transformative potential of

	to quickly develop a large number of traits in key crops, obtain regulatory clearance and field validation data, and become a new leader in the agricultural biotechnology landscape.

	Based on the USDA letters dated August 28, 2014, May 5, 2015, May 20, 2015 and February 2016, confirming
	that certain of Calyxt&#146;s potato, soybean and wheat products fall outside of the scope of plant regulation, we seek to enter the U.S. agricultural biotechnology market by using our proprietary TALEN technology, which we believe will enable us to
	expedite the trait development process to 6-10 years and significantly lower the cost associated with development. In addition, our gene-editing approach results in transgene-free food products. We believe this will result in simpler, shorter and
	cheaper regulatory pathway because our products may avoid the significant expenses and long process associated with plant deregulation. We thus believe Calyxt will have the ability to commercialize its products quickly without incurring major
	regulatory costs or going through time-consuming deregulation studies.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Soybean oil is low in monounsaturated fatty acids compared to canola and olive oils. Consumption of oils high in monounsaturated fats is
	considered healthier, and such oils typically have a longer shelf life and enhanced oxidative stability. Partial hydrogenation is often undertaken to improve soybean oil&#146;s fatty acid profile. However, a negative consequence of hydrogenation is
	the production of trans-fatty acids, which when consumed raises low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol levels and contributes to cardio-vascular diseases.

	We are developing a new variety of soybean with a high oleic acid and low linolenic acid content,
	which eliminates the need for hydrogenation and the creation of trans-fats. This new variety has a fatty acid profile very similar to olive oil, with the added benefit of a decrease of approximately 20% in saturated fatty acids compared to standard
	soybean oil. In mid-2015, we received two letters from the USDA confirming that our high oleic and low linolenic varieties were deemed non-regulated under the Plant Protection Act. In November 2015, we announced completion of the second year of
	multi-location d trials in Minnesota and South Dakota of Calyxt&#146;s high oleic/no trans fat soybean variety.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2015, 225&nbsp;million hectares of wheat were harvested worldwide resulting in more than 735&nbsp;million metric tons of production, making
	wheat the third most-produced cereal in the world. Like many cereal crops, wheat is susceptible to a number of fungal diseases. One in particular, powdery mildew, which is caused by the fungal pathogen
<I>
	Blumeria graminis
</I>
	f. sp.
<I>
	tritici
</I>
	,
	is particularly devastating. Yield losses associated with heavy powdery mildew infestations can be as high as 40%, with grain quality also being negatively affected.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to an agreement with Plant Bioscience Limited and Institute of Genetics and Development Biology Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGBD),
	Calyxt holds an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license on traits that are newly developed by IGBD, including a trait providing for resistance to powdery mildew. This trait would not only improve yield potential but would also reduce the

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the cold storage of potatoes, starch is converted into reducing sugars through a process known as &#147;cold-induced sweetening.&#148;
	Once these cold-stored potatoes are cooked at temperatures above 250&deg;F, the free amino acids and reducing sugars interact to form browning and acrylamide. The National Toxicology Program has reported that acrylamide is &#147;reasonably
	anticipated to be a human carcinogen.&#148; The International Agency for Research on Cancer similarly considers acrylamide to be a &#147;probable human carcinogen&#148; based on studies in laboratory animals.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Companies operating in the potato market lose a portion of raw material potatoes that must be stored. This loss, which is estimated to be
	approximately 10%, results from a combination of sprouting and browning, both of which can be avoided by colder storage. However, cold storage traditionally has been limited by the cold-induced sweetening that results from this type of storage. A
	cold storable potato, like the one developed by Calyxt, can address sprouting and browning as well as the traditional storage limitations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have developed a potato that can be cold stored but does not produce acrylamide during cooking. In November 2015, we announced the

	In 2013, wheat was the second-most produced cereal grain globally. A key component of wheat is gluten. Gluten gives elasticity to dough,
	helping it rise and keep its shape and often gives texture to the final product. However, gluten found in wheat can also be responsible for adverse immune system reactions. People sensitive to gluten generally feel better on a diet with less gluten.

	Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent
	issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file patent applications, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first
	non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. In certain instances, a patent term can be extended under certain circumstances. For example, in the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a
	patent term restoration of up to five years to effectively compensate for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process, subject to several limitations discussed below under &#147;&#151;Our Intellectual Property Strategy.&#148; Also,
	in the United States, a patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is
	terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. Our issued patents will expire on dates ranging from 2015 to 2035. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2023
	to 2035. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of
	regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	believe our current layered patent estate, together with our efforts to develop and patent next generation technologies, provides us with substantial intellectual property protection. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property
	rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our strategy is also to develop and obtain additional
	intellectual property covering innovative manufacturing processes and methods for genetically engineering T-cells expressing new constructs and for genetically engineering plants expressing new traits. To support this effort, we have established
	expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of pre-clinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and
	implementation. Thus, we expect to file additional patent applications to expand this layer of our intellectual property estate.

	The term
	of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which
	priority is claimed. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if
	a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which is designed to compensate
	for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent term restoration is calculated based on the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act cannot
	extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be restored. Moreover, a patent can only be restored once, and thus, if a single patent is
	applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending
	upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.

	Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially
	important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third

	With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor

	Due to the promising therapeutic effect of T-cell therapies in clinical exploratory trials, we anticipate substantial

	clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.
	Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified

	Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to
	determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this
	event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review
	of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in
	accordance with cGMP regulations to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions
	of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not
	bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
	Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. A REMS may be imposed to ensure safe use of the drug, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use,
	such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.

	Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the
	product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For immunotherapy products,
	the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the current good tissue practice, or GTP requirements, to the extent applicable. These requirements are set out in FDA regulations and guidance documents and
	govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for use in implantation, transplantation,
	infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable
	disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more
	clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the

	Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the

	If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its submitted form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for
	example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for

	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such
	designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited
	circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or
	biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.

	A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it

	contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if

	The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that
	meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease
	or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track
	product candidate at any time during the clinical development of the product candidate. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider the review of sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the
	sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section
	of the BLA.

	Any product candidate, submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be
	eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy
	where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an
	application for a new product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and aims to review such applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review. Additionally, a product candidate may
	be eligible for accelerated approval. Product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated
	approval which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on
	the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
	As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In

	Under
	the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, the FDA established a Breakthrough Therapy Designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious
	or life-threatening conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence
	indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of
	the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same
	product candidate if the relevant criteria are met.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing

	request.

	Maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and
	financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Any products for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by
	the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying
	with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#146;s approved
	uses (known as off-label use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label
	use that they deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency,
	purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is
	approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release. In this case, as part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the
	product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the
	manufacturer&#146;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to
	the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.

	In addition, we and any third-party manufacturers of our products will be required to comply with
	applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial
	quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to
	investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are
	subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality
	control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the
	market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as

	Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However,
	patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the
	submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted

	under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical
	manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors
	are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of
	the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis

	The containment of
	healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in
	implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Similar policies and laws have been adopted by many EU Member States. Adoption of price controls
	and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidate or a
	decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidate could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.

	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements
	governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control
	the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product
	on the market. For example, in France, effective access to the market assumes that our future products will be supported by the hospital (through an agreement for local communities) or reimbursed by social security. The price of medications is
	negotiated with the Economic Committee for Health Products, or CEPS. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing
	arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.

	Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant
	regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member
	States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. To improve the current system, a new Regulation No.&nbsp;536/2014 on clinical trials on medicinal
	product candidates for human use, which will repeal Directive 2001/20/EC, was adopted on April&nbsp;16, 2014 and published in the European Official Journal on May&nbsp;27, 2014. The new Regulation aims at harmonizing and streamlining the clinical
	trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency. The new Regulation entered into force on June&nbsp;16, 2014 and was set to apply not
	earlier than May&nbsp;28, 2016. Based on announcements of the European Medicines Agency, it is now expected that the mentioned Regulation will not enter into force before October 2018. Until then the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will
	continue to apply. In addition, the transitional provisions of the new Regulation offer, under certain conditions, the clinical trial sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the Directive and the Regulation for a limited

	Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU Member States

	products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is also
	mandatory for so-called Advance Therapy Medicinal Products (or ATMPs). ATMPs comprise gene therapy, somatic cell and tissue engineered products. In this regard, on May&nbsp;28, 2014, the EMA issued a recommendation that Cellectis&#146; UCART19 be

	therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure, the CHMP serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of

	In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e.,
	reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical
	trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market
	exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be
	extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their
	authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

	The EU also provides opportunities

	The criteria for designating an &#147;orphan medicinal product&#148; in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under
	Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1)&nbsp;it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2)&nbsp;either (a)&nbsp;such
	condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b)&nbsp;the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and
	(3)&nbsp;there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as
	defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the
	approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan
	drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and
	approval process.

	USDA has regulatory jurisdiction over transgenic crops through the Animal and
	Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS. Under the Plant Protection Act, USDA requires anyone who wishes to import, transport interstate, or plant a &#147;regulated article&#148; to apply for a permit or notify APHIS that the introduction will be
	made. Regulated articles are defined as &#147;any organism which has been altered or produced through genetic engineering . . . which USDA determines is a plant pest or has reason to believe is a plant pest.&#148; The petition process can be a
	multi-year process that varies based on a number of factors, including APHIS&#146; familiarity with similar products, the type and scope of the environmental review conducted, and the number and types of public comments received. APHIS conducts a
	comprehensive science-based review of the petition to assess, among other things, plant pest risk, environmental considerations pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA, and any potential impact on endangered species. If,
	upon the completion of the review, APHIS grants the petition, the product is no longer deemed a &#147;regulated article&#148; and the petitioner may commercialize the product, subject to any conditions set forth in the decision. If APHIS does not
	determine the product to be non-regulated, the product may be subject to extensive regulation, including permitting requirements for import, handling, interstate movement, and release into the environment, and inspections.

	As part of its National Organic Program, USDA also regulates GMOs, or genetically modified (&#147;GM&#148;) foods, to the extent that food
	manufacturers can use the &#147;USDA Organic&#148; label on their products. The use of genetic engineering, or GMOs, is prohibited in USDA organic products. According to USDA, this means, for example, that an organic farmer cannot plant GMO seeds,
	an organic cow cannot eat GMO alfalfa or corn, and an organic soup producer cannot put any GM ingredients into its soup. To label products with the USDA organic seal, farmers and food processors must show they are not using GMOs and that they are
	protecting their products from contact with GMOs (along with other prohibited substances) from farm to table.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a pioneering
	gene-editing company, employing our core proprietary technologies to develop best-in-class products in the emerging field of immuno-oncology. Our product candidates, based on gene-edited T-cells that express chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, seek
	to harness the power of the immune system to target and eradicate cancers. We believe that CAR-based immunotherapy is one of the most promising areas of cancer research, representing a new paradigm for cancer treatment. We are designing
	next-generation immunotherapies that are based on gene-edited CAR T-cells. Our gene-editing technologies allow us to create allogeneic CAR T-cells, meaning they are derived from healthy donors rather than the patients themselves. We believe that the
	allogeneic production of CAR T-cells will allow us to develop cost-effective, &#147;off-the-shelf&#148; products and are capable of being stored and distributed worldwide. Our gene-editing expertise also enables us to develop product candidates that
	feature additional safety and efficacy attributes, including control properties designed to prevent them from attacking healthy tissues, to enable them to tolerate standard oncology treatments, and to equip them to resist mechanisms that inhibit
	immune-system activity. In addition to our focus on immuno-oncology, we are exploring the use of our gene-editing technologies in other therapeutic applications, as well as to develop healthier food products for a growing population.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We currently conduct our operations through two business segments, Therapeutics and Plants. Our Therapeutics segment is focused on the
	development of products in the field of immuno-oncology and of novel products outside immuno-oncology to treat other human diseases. Our Plants segment focuses on applying our gene-editing technologies to develop new generation plant products in the
	field of agricultural biotechnology through its own efforts or through alliances with other companies in the agricultural market.

	Since
	our inception in early 2000, we have devoted substantially all of our financial resources to research and development efforts. Our current research and development focuses primarily on our CAR T-cell immunotherapy product candidates, including
	preparing to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. In addition, by leveraging our plant-engineering platform and the
	transformative potential of gene editing, we aim to create food products with consumer health benefits, adaptations for climate change or nutritional enhancements that address the needs of a growing population. We do not have any products approved
	for sale and have not generated any revenues from immunotherapy or agricultural biotechnology product sales.

	In February 2014, we entered

	allowed for an early exercise of Servier&#146;s option with respect to UCART19 and other product candidates. Pursuant to this amendment, Servier has exercised its option to acquire the exclusive worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize
	UCART19. In addition, Pfizer and Servier have announced that they have entered into an exclusive global license and collaboration agreement to co-develop and commercialize UCART19.

	collaborations, and licensing arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force

	Historically, we also operated a Tools and Services segment,

	subsidiaries Cellectis Bioresearch, Ectycell, Cellectis Bioresearch Inc. and Cellectis AB. In light of our current strategic goals, our board of directors decided to initiate a plan to wind down the Tools and Services segment, and, beginning in
	2013, we gradually reduced the operations conducted in this segment. Other than the run-off of legacy contracts, following the divestiture of Cellectis AB in August 2014, the Tools and Services segment does not have any operations. In connection
	with our discontinuation of operations in the Tools and Services segment, we approved redundancy plans, which resulted in the termination of 45 employees throughout 2014.

	the fiscal year in which the expenditures were incurred and during the next three fiscal years. If taxes due are not sufficient to cover the full amount of the tax credit at the end of the three-year period, the difference is repaid to us in cash by
	the French tax authorities. We also satisfy certain criteria that qualify us as a small/middle size company and permit us to request immediate payment of the CIR. The expenditures taken into account for the calculation of the CIR only involve

	Due to the increased level of efforts towards our R&amp;D activities in order to develop product candidates and work toward clinical phases,
	in 2015 we started to classify personnel and other costs related to information technology, human resources, business development, legal, intellectual property and general management in R&amp;D expense based on the time that employees spent

	Our research and development efforts are focused on our existing product candidates, including the advancement of our lead product candidate,
	UCART19, to the filing in 2015 of an application for a CTA in the United Kingdom. We use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs directed toward developing our cell-based platform and for
	identifying and developing product candidates. We manage certain activities such as pre-clinical research and manufacture of product candidates through our partner institutions or other third-party vendors. Due to the number of ongoing projects and
	our ability to use resources across several projects, we do not record or maintain information regarding the costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program-specific basis.

	Our research and development efforts are central to our business and account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We expect
	that our research and development costs will increase in the foreseeable future as we implement our new clinical trials, manufacture pre-commercial clinical trial and pre-clinical study materials, expand our research and development and process
	development efforts, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, access and develop additional technologies, and hire additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. This is
	because product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Likewise, in our
	plant products business, we expect our research and development expenses to increase over the next several years as we develop new agricultural product candidates and advance them through field trials toward commercial proof of concept.

	revenue of &#128;18.8&nbsp;million in connection with the amendment to our collaboration agreement with Servier, which was signed on November&nbsp;18, 2015. This increase in revenues was partially offset by a &#128;5.3&nbsp;million decrease in

	In connection with our ordinary course annual procedures, the Company identified certain immaterial errors in revenue recognition related to
	license contracts signed in 2012 and 2013 in our Plants segment. While nonrefundable upfront payments received were fully recognized in revenues at the contract dates, these payments should instead have been recognized over the license periods
	provided for by the contracts. Adjustments to prior periods are immaterial and therefore have been recorded in the Statement of Consolidated Operations in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The cumulative adjustment recorded was
	&#128;0.8&nbsp;million at the end of 2015. Had corrections been recorded contemporaneously, Plant segment revenue and other income would have been &#128;0.5&nbsp;million in 2013, &#128;1.1&nbsp;million in 2014 and &#128;1.1&nbsp;million in 2015. The

	We have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception in 2000, and we anticipate that we will continue
	to incur losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations,
	which we may raise through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.

	continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are
	subject to all risks incident in the development of new gene therapy products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We are also subject to all
	risks incident in the development of new agricultural products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We expect to continue to incur additional
	costs associated with operating as a public company in the United States. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with our public company obligations in the United States and our
	continued compliance with applicable U.S. exchange listing and SEC requirements. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations, including for the further development of our existing
	product candidates and to pursue other development activities related to additional product candidates.

	We believe our cash and cash equivalents, our cash flow from operations (including payments we
	expect to receive pursuant to our collaboration agreements) and government funding of research programs will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least 2018. However, we may require additional capital for the further development of our
	existing product candidates and may also need to raise additional funds sooner to pursue other development activities related to additional product candidates.

	Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenues from our products, if ever, we expect to finance a portion of future cash needs through
	public or private equity or debt offerings. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay,
	scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing
	shareholders, increased fixed payment obligations and these securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair
	our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct
	our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.

	Our forecast of the period of

	Under French law and our By-laws, our board of directors must be composed of between three and eight members. Within this limit, the number of
	directors is determined by our shareholders. Directors are elected, re-elected and may be removed at a shareholders&#146; general meeting with a simple majority vote of our shareholders. Pursuant to our By-laws, our directors are elected for
	three-year terms. In accordance with French law, our By-laws also provide that our directors may be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes of the shareholders present, represented by
	a proxy or voting by mail at the relevant ordinary shareholders&#146; meeting, and that any vacancy on our board resulting from the death or resignation of a director, provided there are at least three directors remaining, may be filled by vote of a
	majority of our directors then in office provided that there has been no shareholders meeting since such death or resignation. Directors chosen or appointed to fill a vacancy shall be elected by the board for the remaining duration of the current
	term of the replaced director. The appointment must then be ratified at the next shareholders&#146; general meeting. In the event the board would be composed of less than three directors as a result of a vacancy, the remaining directors shall
	immediately convene a shareholders&#146; general meeting to elect one or several new directors so there are at least three directors serving on the board, in accordance with French law.

	Corporate Governance Practices

	As a French
<I>
	soci&eacute;t&eacute; anonyme
</I>
	, we are subject to various corporate governance requirements under French law. In addition, as
	a foreign private issuer listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, we will be subject to the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. However, the Nasdaq Global Market&#146;s listing standards provide that foreign private issuers are permitted to
	follow home country corporate governance practices in lieu of the Nasdaq rules, with certain exceptions. Certain corporate governance practices in France may differ significantly from corporate governance listing standards. For example, neither the
	corporate laws of France nor our By-laws require that (i)&nbsp;a majority of our directors be independent, (ii)&nbsp;our compensation committee include only independent directors, or (iii)&nbsp;our independent directors hold regularly scheduled
	meetings at which only independent directors are present. Other than as set forth below, we currently intend to comply with the corporate governance listing standards of Nasdaq to the extent possible under French law. However, we may choose to
	change such practices to follow home country practice in the future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although we are a foreign private issuer, we are required to comply
	with Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, relating to audit committee composition and responsibilities. Rule 10A-3 provides that the audit committee must have direct responsibility for the nomination, compensation and choice of our auditors, as well as
	control over the performance of their duties, management of complaints made, and selection of consultants. Under Rule 10A-3, if the laws of a foreign private issuer&#146;s home country require that any such matter be approved by the board of
	directors or the shareholders of the Company, the audit committee&#146;s responsibilities or powers with respect to such matter may instead be advisory. Under French law, the audit committee may only have an advisory role and appointment of our
	statutory auditors, in particular, must be decided by our shareholders at our annual meeting.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, Nasdaq rules require that a

</SUB>
	% of the outstanding shares of the company&#146;s common voting stock. We follow our French home
	country practice, rather than complying with this Nasdaq rule. Consistent with French Law, our By-laws provide that when first convened, general meetings of shareholders may validly convene only if the shareholders present or represented hold at
	least (1)&nbsp;20% of the voting shares in the case of an ordinary general meeting or of an extraordinary general meeting where shareholders are voting on a capital increase by capitalization of reserves, profits or share premium, or (2)&nbsp;25% of
	the voting shares in the case of any other extraordinary general meeting. If such quorum required by French law is not met, the meeting is adjourned. There is no quorum requirement under French law when an ordinary general meeting or an
	extraordinary general meeting where shareholders are voting on a capital increase by capitalization of reserves, profits or share premium is reconvened, but the reconvened meeting may consider only questions that were on the agenda of the adjourned
	meeting. When any other extraordinary general meeting is reconvened, the required quorum under French law is 20% of the shares entitled to vote. If a quorum is not met at a reconvened meeting requiring a quorum, then the meeting may be adjourned for
	a maximum of two months.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	Finally, Nasdaq rules require

	advantageous tax treatment or otherwise, as a general matter, we intend to follow our French home country practice, which does not require shareholder approval of such plans or arrangements, rather than complying with this Nasdaq rule.

	any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which we and any related parties are, were or will be participants, which are not (1)&nbsp;in the ordinary course of business, (2)&nbsp;at arms&#146; length and (3)&nbsp;in which
	the amount involved exceeds $120,000. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee or director are not covered by this policy. For purposes of this policy, a related party is any executive officer, director (or

	Under the policy, related-party transactions must be reported to us by all related parties. If a transaction has been identified as a
	related-party transaction, our management must present information regarding the related-party transaction to our board of directors for review, consideration and approval. Certain transactions may be presented to the Audit and Finance Committee,
	which will determine whether the transaction is a related-party transaction, in which case the related-party transaction will be submitted to our board of directors. The presentation will include a description of, among other things, the material
	facts, the interests in the transaction, direct and indirect, of the related parties, the benefits to us of the transaction and whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or from, as the case may be, an
	unrelated third-party or to or from employees generally. In addition, under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our employees and directors have an affirmative responsibility to disclose any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be
	expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. In considering related-party transactions, our board, or to the extent permitted by applicable law an independent committee of our board, will take into account the relevant available facts and

	as a result of such distribution our net assets are or would become lower than the amount of the share capital plus the amount of the legal reserves which, under French law, may not be distributed to shareholders (the amount of our share capital

	. Dividends are distributed to shareholders
	proportionally to their shareholding interests. In the case of interim dividends, distributions are made to shareholders on the date set by our board of directors during the meeting in which the distribution of interim dividends is approved. The
	actual dividend payment date is decided by the shareholders at an ordinary general shareholders&#146; meeting or by our board in the absence of such a decision by the shareholders. Shareholders that own shares on the actual payment date are entitled
	to the dividend.

	Dividends may be paid in cash or, if the shareholders&#146; meeting so decides, in kind, provided that all the

	receive his dividend in cash or in shares.

	On March 16, 2016, Cellectis S.A. announced jointly with MabQuest SA (a biotech company focused
	on the development of antibody-based therapeutic interventions) that the companies have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement pertaining to the development of a new class of monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1. The action of
	these PD-1 antibodies is to promote the recovery of T-cells from exhaustion through a new mechanism of action, which does not block the PD-1-PD-L1 interaction. Cellectis plans to use these PD-1 antagonist antibodies in combination therapy with its
	gene-edited UCART candidate products as well as a single-agent or in combination with other already approved immunotherapy drugs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	agreement includes a collaboration phase funded by Cellectis whereby Cellectis and MabQuest will jointly pursue preclinical research on several candidate antibodies; and a clinical development and commercialization phase of the best selected
	antibodies which will be led by Cellectis. It also includes an exclusive option which, if exercised, would grant Cellectis worldwide exclusive rights over the family of PD-1 antagonist antibodies developed under the collaboration for all fields, and
	further potential derivatives of these antibodies.

	The Code provides
	special rules regarding certain distributions received by U.S. persons with respect to, and sales, exchanges and other dispositions, including pledges, of, shares of stock (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) in a PFIC. A non-U.S.
	corporation will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which either: (1)&nbsp;at least 75 percent of its gross income is &#147;passive income&#148; or (2)&nbsp;at least 50 percent of its gross assets during the taxable year (based on the
	average of the fair market values of the assets determined at the end of each quarterly period) are &#147;passive assets,&#148; which generally means that they produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income
	for this purpose generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, gains from commodities and securities transactions, and gains from assets that produce passive income. In determining whether a foreign corporation is a
	PFIC, a pro rata portion of the income and assets of each corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, at least a 25% interest (by value) is taken into account.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although not free from doubt, we believe that we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the 2015 taxable year, but our PFIC
	status must be determined annually and therefore may be subject to change. Because this determination is made annually at the end of each taxable year and is dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the
	amount and nature of our income, as well as on the market valuation of our assets and our spending schedule for our cash balances, and because certain aspects of the PFIC rules are not entirely certain, there can be no assurance that we are or are
	not a PFIC or that the IRS will agree with our conclusion regarding our PFIC status. If we are not a PFIC during any taxable year in which you hold ADSs, then the remainder of the discussion under &#147;Taxation&#151;Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
	Considerations,&#148; outside of this &#147;PFIC Considerations&#148; portion may be relevant to you.

	A U.S. holder that holds ADSs
	during any taxable year in which we qualify as a PFIC is subject to special tax rules with respect to (a)&nbsp;any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the ADSs and (b)&nbsp;any &#147;excess distribution&#148; by the
	corporation to the holder, unless the holder elects to treat the PFIC as a &#147;qualified electing fund,&#148; or QEF, or makes a &#147;mark-to-market&#148; election, each as discussed below. An &#147;excess distribution&#148; is that portion of a
	distribution with respect to ADSs that exceeds 125% of the annual average of such distributions over the preceding three-year period or, if shorter, the U.S. holder&#146;s holding period for its ADSs. Excess distributions and gains on the sale,
	exchange or other disposition of ADSs of a corporation which was a PFIC at any time during the U.S. holder&#146;s holding period are allocated ratably to each day of the U.S. holder&#146;s holding period. Amounts allocated to the taxable year in
	which the disposition occurs and amounts allocated to any period in the shareholder&#146;s holding period before the first day of the first taxable year that the corporation was a PFIC will be taxed as ordinary income (rather than capital gain)
	earned in the taxable year of the disposition. Amounts allocated to each of the other taxable years in the U.S. holder&#146;s holding period are not included in gross income for the year of the disposition, but are subject to the highest ordinary
	income tax rates in effect for individuals or corporations, as applicable, for each such year and the interest charge generally applicable to income tax deficiencies will be imposed on the resulting tax attributable to each year. The tax liability
	for amounts allocated to years before the year of disposition or &#147;excess distribution&#148; cannot be offset by any net operating losses for such years, and gains (but not losses) realized on the sale of the ADSs cannot be treated as capital,
	even if a U.S. holder held such ADSs as capital assets.

	If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds ADSs, then we generally

	terminates this deemed PFIC status by making a &#147;deemed sale&#148; election. If such election is made, a U.S. holder will be deemed to have sold the ADSs at their fair market value on the last day of the last taxable year for which we were a
	PFIC, and any gain from such deemed sale would be subject to the excess distribution rules as described above. After the deemed sale election, the ADSs with respect to which the deemed sale election was made will not be treated as shares in a PFIC

	The excess distribution rules may be avoided if a U.S. holder makes a QEF election effective
	beginning with the first taxable year in the holder&#146;s holding period in which we are treated as a PFIC with respect to such holder. A U.S. holder that makes a QEF election with respect to a PFIC is required to include in income its pro rata
	share of the PFIC&#146;s ordinary earnings and net capital gain as ordinary income and capital gain, respectively, subject to a separate election to defer payment of taxes, which deferral is subject to an interest charge.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In general, a U.S. holder makes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 to a timely filed (taking into account any extensions)
	U.S. federal income tax return for the year beginning with which the QEF election is to be effective. In certain circumstances, a U.S. holder may be able to make a retroactive QEF election. A QEF election can be revoked only with the consent of the
	IRS. In order for a U.S. holder to make a valid QEF election, the corporation must annually provide or make available to the holder certain information. We have prepared the PFIC statement and we will provide upon request from the U.S. holders who
	wish&nbsp;to make a QEF election.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As an alternative to making a QEF election, a U.S. holder may make a &#147;mark-to-market&#148;
	election with respect to its ADSs if the ADSs meet certain minimum trading requirements, as described below. If a U.S. holder makes a valid mark-to-market election for the first taxable year in which such holder holds (or is deemed to hold) ADSs in
	a corporation and for which such corporation is determined to be a PFIC, such holder generally will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above in respect of its ADSs. Instead, a U.S. holder that makes a mark-to-market election will be required
	to include in income each year an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the ADSs that the holder owns as of the close of the taxable year over the holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs. The U.S. holder will be
	entitled to a deduction for the excess, if any, of the holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs over the fair market value of the ADSs as of the close of the taxable year; provided, however, that the deduction will be limited to the extent of
	any net mark-to-market gains with respect to the ADSs included by the U.S. holder under the election for prior taxable years. The U.S. holder&#146;s basis in the ADSs will be adjusted to reflect the amounts included or deducted pursuant to the
	election. Amounts included in income pursuant to a mark-to-market election, as well as gain on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the ADSs, will be treated as ordinary income. The deductible portion of any mark-to-market loss, as well as
	loss on a sale, exchange or other disposition of ADSs to the extent that the amount of such loss does not exceed net mark-to-market gains previously included in income, will be treated as ordinary loss. If a U.S. holder makes a valid mark-to-market
	election, any distributions made by us would generally be subject to the rules discussed below under &#147;&#151;Taxation of Dividends,&#148; except the lower rate applicable to qualified dividend income would not apply. If we cease to be a PFIC
	when a U.S. holder has a mark-to-market election in effect, gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder on the sale of our ADSs will be a capital gain or loss and taxed in the manner described below under &#147;&#151;Taxation of Sale, Exchange or other
	Disposition of ADSs.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The mark-to-market election applies to the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent
	taxable years, unless the ADSs cease to meet applicable trading requirements (described below) or the IRS consents to its revocation. The excess distribution rules generally do not apply to a U.S. holder for taxable years for which a mark-to-market
	election is in effect. If we are a PFIC for any year in which the U.S. holder owns ADSs but before a mark-to-market election is made, the interest charge rules described above will apply to any mark-to-market gain recognized in the year the election

	must also provide such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department if the U.S. holder (1)&nbsp;receives certain direct or indirect distributions from a PFIC, (2)&nbsp;recognizes gain on a direct or indirect disposition of

	Under
	attribution rules, if we are a PFIC, U.S. holders of our ADSs will be deemed to own their proportionate shares of any of our subsidiaries that are PFICs. It is possible that one or more of our subsidiaries is or will become a PFIC. Such
	determination is made annually at the end of each taxable year and is dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the amount and nature of a subsidiary&#146;s income, as well as the market valuation and nature
	of a subsidiary&#146;s assets. In such case, assuming a U.S. holder does not receive from such subsidiary the information that the U.S. holder needs to make a QEF election with respect to such a subsidiary, a U.S. holder generally will be deemed to
	own a portion of the shares of such lower-tier PFIC and may incur liability for a deferred tax and interest charge if we receive a distribution from, or dispose of all or part of our interest in, or the U.S. holder otherwise is deemed to have
	disposed of an interest in, the lower-tier PFIC, even though the U.S. holder has not received the proceeds of those distributions or dispositions directly. There is no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of the status of any such lower-tier
	PFIC, or that we will cause the lower-tier PFIC to provide the required information for a U.S. holder to make or maintain a QEF election with respect to the lower-tier PFIC. In addition, a mark-to-market election generally would not be available

	We seek to engage in prudent management of our cash and cash equivalents, mainly cash on hand and common financial instruments (typically
	short- and mid-term deposits). Furthermore, the interest rate risk related to cash, cash equivalents and common financial instruments is not significant based on the quality of the financial institutions with which we work.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We derive
	a significant portion of our revenues, including payments under our collaboration agreement with Pfizer in U.S. dollars. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2015, we have been significantly expanding our activities in the United States, but there
	continues to be a currency mismatch in our cash flows since most of our expenses remain denominated primarily in Euros. If the average value of the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar had been 10% higher relative to the euro during 2015, our net income would have
	increased by &#128;0.2&nbsp;million. Our exposure to currencies other than the U.S. dollar is negligible.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our financial condition and
	results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant local base currency and then translated each month into Euros for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. We translate balance sheet amounts at the exchange rates in effect
	on the date of the balance sheet, while income and cash flow items are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect for the relevant period.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, our revenues denominated in U.S. dollars notably related to Servier and Pfizer collaboration
	agreements and revenues from our Plants segment. Our cash and cash equivalents denominated in U.S dollars amounted to $283 million as at December&nbsp;31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have not adopted a hedging mechanism to protect our business activity against fluctuations in exchange rates. As a result, we recorded
	financial revenue of &#128;9.2&nbsp;million and financial expense of &#128;1.7&nbsp;million in 2015, which reflects the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalent accounts. We are currently evaluating a
	potential hedging policy that, if adopted, could mitigate a portion of the risk associated with foreign exchange rate movements. We cannot rule out the possibility that a significant increase in our business, particularly in the United States, may
	result in greater exposure to exchange rate risk. We would then consider adopting an appropriate policy for hedging against these risks.

	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our

	In March 2015, we sold 5,500,000 ADSs, each representing one ordinary share, nominal value &#128;0.05, in our initial public
	offering at a price of $41.50 per ADS, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $228.3 million. We incurred aggregate underwriting discounts of approximately $16.0 million and expenses of approximately $2.7 million, resulting in net proceeds to
	us of approximately $209.6 million. No payments were made directly or indirectly to any director, officer, general partner of ours or to their associates, persons owning ten percent or more of any class of our equity securities, or to any of our
	affiliates. The offering commenced on March&nbsp;24, 2015 and did not terminate before all of the securities registered in the registration statement were sold. The effective date of the registration statement, File No.&nbsp;333-202205, for our
	initial public offering was March&nbsp;24, 2015. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated, Jefferies LLC, Piper Jaffray&nbsp;&amp; Co., Oppenheimer&nbsp;&amp; Co. Inc. and Trout Capital LLC acted as underwriters of the initial
	public offering.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering was used for general corporate purposes in connection
	with the development of our current proprietary immuno-oncology product candidates, for further research and development regarding cell attributes and to develop our manufacturing processes and cell engineering technologies, to pursue new human
	therapeutics outside of oncology and to advance our agricultural biotechnology business. The balance is held in cash and cash equivalents and is intended to also be used for general corporate purposes. None of the net proceeds of our initial public
	offering were paid directly or indirectly to any director, officer, general partner of ours or to their associates, persons owning ten percent or more of any class of our equity securities, or to any of our affiliates.

	The audit and finance committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation of and overseeing the work of the independent
	registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, the audit and finance committee has adopted a policy governing the pre-approval of all audit and permitted non-audit services performed by our independent registered public
	accounting firm to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair the independent registered public accounting firm&#146;s independence from us and our management. Unless a type of service to be provided by our independent registered
	public accounting firm has received general pre-approval from the audit and finance committee, it requires specific pre-approval by the audit and finance committee. The payment for any proposed services in excess of pre-approved cost levels requires
	specific pre-approval by the audit and finance committee. All audit and non-audit services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm in 2015 were pre-approved by the audit and finance committee.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to its pre-approval policy, the audit and finance committee may delegate its authority to pre-approve services to the chairperson of
	the audit and finance committee. The decisions of the chairperson to grant pre-approvals must be presented to the full audit and finance committee at its next scheduled meeting. The audit and finance committee may not delegate its responsibilities
	to pre-approve services to the management.

	The audit and finance committee has considered the non-audit services provided by

	voting on a capital increase by capitalization of reserves, profits or share premium, or (2)&nbsp;25% of the voting shares in the case of any other extraordinary general meeting. If such quorum required by French law is not met, the meeting is

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying statements of consolidated financial position of Cellectis S.A. as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and
	the related statements of consolidated operations, consolidated comprehensive loss, consolidated cash flows, and consolidated changes in shareholders&#146; equity for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These
	financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
	the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
	Cellectis S.A. at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with International Financial Reporting
	Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

	registered and domiciled in Paris, France. We are a gene-editing company, employing our core proprietary technologies to develop products in the emerging field of immuno-oncology. Our product candidates, based on gene-edited T-cells that express
	chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, seek to harness the power of the immune system to target and eradicate cancers. Our gene-editing technologies allow us to create allogeneic CAR T-cells, meaning they are derived from healthy donors rather than
	the patients themselves. In addition to our focus on immuno-oncology, we are exploring the use of our gene-editing technologies in other therapeutic applications, as well as to develop healthier food products for a growing population.

	Government grants to Cellectis related to research and development expenses for research programs are
	recognized as &#147;Subsidies receivables&#148; in the period in which the expenses subject to the subsidy have been incurred, provided there is a reasonable assurance that we will comply with conditions attached to the subsidy and that the subsidy

	The valuation allowance for other subsidies corresponds to the CellMill grant. Due to the uncertainty related to the
	collection of this subsidy, it was fully reserved in 2014. Note that in 2011 and 2012, we entered into a subsidy agreement for a research program named &#147;CellMill&#148; for a total amount of &#128;11.0&nbsp;million with five different local,
	regional and national agencies. The received subsidies are non-refundable. However, for some of them, the contract stipulated that the funds would have to be repaid if we moved out of the location where the research activities on CellMill were
	performed (Evry, Essonne). For several reasons, including termination of the partnership by our research partner, we had to close this site in the beginning of 2014, and repaid the undue amount in 2015.

	D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations contributed &#128;3.5&nbsp;million to Cellectis Bioresearch. As a result, Ectycell became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cellectis Bioresearch, of which, in turn, Cellectis owns 75.5% and Caisse des

	Conditional advances are made to Cellectis by Bpifrance (formerly named OSEO Innovation) to co-finance
	research programs including market opportunities. The nominal amount of the advance covering the entire program is contractually fixed at the date of grant, and paid up-front for a portion and in installments depending on achievement of milestones
	over periods that may cover several years. Interest at below market rates is generally provided in the contracts. Repayment of the advance and interest is contractually required in the event the research program is considered a commercial success.
	Commercial failure is determined based on the agreement between parties to formally conclude that the research activities will not result in the achievement of commercial success. In such cases, the liability is extinguished.

	Calyxt, Inc. announced on March&nbsp;1, 2016 that it closed on the purchase of a 10-acre parcel in the St. Paul suburb of Roseville to build
	its new headquarters facility. The new facility, which should be operational around mid-2017, will consist of a 35,000 square-foot office and lab building, with greenhouses and outdoor research plots.

	On March 16, 2016, Cellectis S.A. announced jointly with MabQuest SA (a biotech company focused on the development of antibody-based
	therapeutic interventions) that the companies have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement pertaining to the development of a new class of monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1. The action of these PD-1 antibodies is to promote
	the recovery of T-cells from exhaustion through a new mechanism of action, which does not block the PD-1-PD-L1 interaction. Cellectis plans to use these PD-1 antagonist antibodies in combination therapy with its gene-edited UCART candidate products
	as well as a single-agent or in combination with other already approved immunotherapy drugs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The agreement includes a collaboration phase
	funded by Cellectis whereby Cellectis and MabQuest will jointly pursue preclinical research on several candidate antibodies; and a clinical development and commercialization phase of the best selected antibodies which will be led by Cellectis. It
	also includes an exclusive option which, if exercised, would grant Cellectis worldwide exclusive rights over the family of PD-1 antagonist antibodies developed under the collaboration for all fields, and further potential derivatives of these
	antibodies.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cellectis (Alternext:ALCLS; Nasdaq:CLLS) and Servier today announced that they signed an amendment to their existing collaboration agreement from
	February 2014 especially for UCART19, a TALEN
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	&nbsp;gene-edited allogeneic Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy. Under this amendment, Servier early exercises its option to
	acquire the exclusive worldwide rights to further develop and commercialize UCART19, which is about to enter Phase 1 development for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Servier have entered into an exclusive global license and collaboration agreement to co-develop and commercialize
	UCART19. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer and Servier will work together on a joint clinical development program for UCART19 and share development costs. Pfizer will be responsible for potential commercialization of UCART19 in the United
	States, and Servier will retain marketing rights in countries outside the United States. Pfizer&#146;s collaboration with Servier on UCART19 is distinct from the collaboration with Cellectis that Pfizer announced in June 2014, which did not include
	UCART19.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	UCART19 utilizes Cellectis&#146; proprietary, allogeneic approach to develop CAR-T therapies that engineer T-cells from non-patient donors for
	use in multiple patients. This is different from autologous approaches, which engineer a patient&#146;s own T-cells.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cellectis will receive from Servier
	a payment of $38.2 million upon signature. In addition, Cellectis is eligible for over $300 million of milestone payments, R&amp;D financing, and royalties on sales from Servier, based on annual net sales of commercialized products. Financial terms
	for the Servier agreement with Pfizer were not disclosed.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	&#147;Servier&#146;s early option exercise is a strong recognition of the potential value of
	UCART19 for patients, as the first allogeneic CAR-T therapy expected to move into clinical development that utilizes Cellectis&#146; TALEN

	Dr.&nbsp;Andr&eacute; Choulika, Ph.D., chairman and chief executive officer of Cellectis. &#147;Cellectis aims to provide cancer patients with highly innovative best-in-class allogeneic CAR-T therapies across all geographies, and we are proud to

	. Regardless of

	that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Beneficiary is and remains Beneficiary&#146;s responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (1)&nbsp;make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment
	of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Share grant, including the grant, vesting of the Shares, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such vesting and the receipt of any dividends; and (2)&nbsp;do not commit to
	structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Shares to reduce or eliminate Beneficiary&#146;s liability for Tax-Related Items.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Prior to vesting
	of the Shares, Beneficiary will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer, if any. In this regard, Beneficiary authorizes the Company
	and/or the Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Beneficiary from Beneficiary&#146;s compensation paid to Beneficiary by the Company and/or Employer or from proceeds of the sale of Shares. Alternatively, or in
	addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may (1)&nbsp;sell or arrange for the sale of Shares that Beneficiary acquires to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items and/or (2)&nbsp;withhold in Shares, provided that the
	Company only withholds the amount of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount. Finally, Beneficiary will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to
	withhold as a result of Beneficiary&#146;s participation in the 2015 Plan or Beneficiary&#146;s acquisition of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to honor the vesting and refuse to deliver the
	Shares if Beneficiary fails to comply with Beneficiary&#146;s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section.
