	We are a clinical stage biotechnology company
	committed to developing meaningful therapies for patients with rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. Currently our focus is on
	trehalose, a therapeutic platform that offers potential solutions for several diseases that share a common pathophysiological mechanism,
	which are the functional changes that accompany a particular syndrome or disease. Since our inception in 2012, our work with trehalose
	has centered around oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, or OPMD, and Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3, or SCA3. We address diseases
	with severe and debilitating manifestations, where the unmet medical need is clear, the biological mechanism of action is understood,
	and for which there is no satisfactory treatment.

	We have devoted substantially all of our
	financial resources to identify, acquire, license, and develop our current product candidate, including conducting nonclinical
	and clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have financed our operations
	primarily through the sale of equity securities. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future
	expenditures. Biotechnological product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk.
	We are in Phase 2 development of Trehalose IV, which is the only product candidate that we currently pursue. It may be several
	years, if ever, before we have this product candidate and/or any future product candidates that we may pursue approved for commercialization.
	Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenue will depend upon the size of any markets
	in which our product candidates may receive approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, pricing, reimbursement
	from third-party payers, and adequate market share for our current or future product candidates in those markets.

	We have incurred continuing losses,
	and depend on outside financing resources to continue our activities. On August 5, 2014, we completed a successful initial
	public offering that raised net proceeds of approximately $31.4 million, and in March 2016 we completed a net $6.1 million
	registered direct offering of our Ordinary Shares and a private placement of warrants to purchase additional Ordinary Shares.
	In the opinion of our management and based on our current business plans, our balances of cash and cash equivalents including
	short-term bank deposits will enable us to fund our activities at least until the end of the second quarter of 2017. However,
	the actual amount of cash we will need to fund our operations is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, the
	timing, design and execution of the clinical trials of our existing drug candidate, any future projects which may be
	in-licensed or any other business development activities. For example, changing circumstances and/or acquisition of new
	technologies may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than management currently anticipates and we may need to
	spend more money than currently expected because of, among others, circumstances beyond our control. Should we be unable to
	obtain additional funding required, we may reduce our activities until we have sufficient funds to continue.

	product sales. We completed two Phase 2a clinical trials of Trehalose IV in two indications. We are not permitted to market or
	promote any of our current or any future product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign

	IV. We may also receive regulatory approval in some jurisdictions, but not others. We cannot be certain that Trehalose IV will
	be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, Trehalose IV may not receive regulatory approval, even

	We generally plan to seek regulatory approval

	of such other countries regarding safety, efficacy, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing,
	and distribution of the product candidates we may attempt to commercialize. Even if we are successful in obtaining approval in

	In addition, even if we obtain regulatory
	approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize Trehalose IV successfully.
	For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop
	competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions
	or post-approval commitments that render Trehalose IV not commercially viable. Further, regulatory authorities may approve Trehalose
	IV for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may limit approved usage to narrower patient populations, may grant approval
	contingent on the performance of costly post- marketing clinical trials, or may approve Trehalose IV with a label that does not
	include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that indication. Any of the foregoing

	Failure can occur at any time during the

	Our Trehalose IV solution has been granted
	orphan designation in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of OPMD and SCA3. Regulatory authorities in some
	jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations
	as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan
	drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as having a patient population of fewer
	than 200,000 individuals diagnosed annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States
	where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States.
	In the European Union, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMA&rsquo;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products,
	or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention
	or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the
	European Union. In the Health Canada proposal, a rare disease is described as a life-threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious
	chronic condition that only affects a very small number of patients, typically less than five in 10,000 persons.

	Additionally, orphan drug designation is
	granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious
	and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug would be sufficient to justify the necessary
	investment in developing the product candidate. Even if we request orphan drug designation for any future product candidates or
	other indications we may develop, there can be no assurances that the FDA or the European Commission will grant any of these product
	candidates such designation. Additionally, the orphan drug designation by the FDA of our current or any future product candidates

	Generally, if a product candidate with
	an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval of the indication for which it has such designation,
	the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing
	application for the same drug and indication for that time period, except in limited circumstances. The applicable period is seven
	years in the United States and 10 years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a product no
	longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is
	no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially

	Act to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for Trehalose IV or any therapeutic candidate
	designated as an orphan drug but does not have broad patent protection, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the
	same condition sooner than if we had obtained orphan drug exclusivity and our revenue will be reduced.

	Even though, we may have obtained orphan
	drug designation for Trehalose IV in the United States for the treatment of OPMD and SCA3, we may not successfully obtain orphan
	drug exclusivity. Any such exclusivity that we do obtain may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because
	different drugs can be approved for the same condition and the same drugs can be approved for different indications and might then
	be used off-label in our approved indication. In the United States, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently
	approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown
	to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, if our current or any future product candidate
	we may develop receives an orphan drug designation is approved for a particular indication or use within the rare disease or condition,
	the FDA may later approve the same drug for additional indications or uses within that rare disease or condition that are not protected
	by our exclusive approval. As a result, if our product is approved and receives orphan drug status, the FDA can still approve other
	drugs for use in treating the same indication or disease covered by our product, which could create a more competitive market for
	us.

	There is significant uncertainty related
	to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. The process for determining whether a third-party payor
	will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay
	for the product. Moreover, a payor&rsquo;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement
	rate will be approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness
	of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any
	product that might obtain regulatory approval, we may need to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data
	relating to such product, which may be costly and difficult to obtain. Further, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
	Services, or CMS, and other third-party payors, frequently change product descriptors, coverage policies, product and service codes,
	payment methodologies and reimbursement rates. Private payers tend to follow the coverage reimbursement policies and payment limitations
	established by CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS or any other third-party payor will decide with
	respect to reimbursement for products such as ours, assuming we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our products, and any
	such policies or payment limitations may be subject to change in the future.

	Outside the United States, international
	operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing
	emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing
	and usage of any product candidate we attempt to commercialize. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to
	varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are
	substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicinal products,
	but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict
	the amount that we are able to charge for any product candidate that we may develop. Accordingly, in markets outside the United
	States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially

	In the United States, there have been
	and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient
	Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to
	as the Affordable Care Act, was signed into law, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both
	governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among
	other things, subjects biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, imposes reporting requirements
	on manufacturers related to drug samples and financial relationships with certain healthcare providers, addresses a new
	methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increases the
	minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to
	individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain
	branded prescription drugs, and promotes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. Some of the provisions of the
	Affordable Care Act have not yet been fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and
	Congressional challenges. The healthcare regulatory environment in the U.S. is still in flux, and judicial challenges and
	legislative initiatives to modify, limit, or repeal the Affordable Care Act continue, and may increase in light of the change
	in administrations following the U.S. Presidential election. For example, a recent Executive Order signed by the U.S.
	President directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the
	implementation of provisions of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on individuals and
	certain entities to the maximum extent permitted by law. We cannot predict the impact on our business of future legal
	challenges to the Affordable Care Act or other changes to current laws and regulations. However, any changes that lower
	reimbursements for products that we obtain regulatory approval for, or that impose administrative and financial burdens on us,
	could adversely affect our business.

	In addition, other legislative changes
	have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include, among others,
	aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. We expect that additional
	state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, which may alter or completely replace the existing
	healthcare financing structure. Any of these reform measures could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay
	for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for any such product candidate that we may have developed
	or additional pricing pressures on our business.

	long-term effects remain uncertain. Similarly, a new U.S. Presidential administration took office in January 2017. It is

	occur where, or what law applies to a given situation, the trade secret may not be recognized as a trade secret, many not fall

	The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting

	paid or denominated in New Israeli Shekels, or NIS. We also contract with CROs internationally, primarily for the execution of

	NIS, Euro or GBP instead devalue relative to the U.S. dollar, that the relative inflation rate may exceed such rate of devaluation,
	or that the timing of such devaluation may lag behind the relative inflation. In any such event, the U.S. dollar cost of our operations
	in Israel and transactions with certain CROs and other third parties would increase and our U.S. dollar-denominated results of
	operations would be adversely affected. To date, we have not engaged in hedging transactions. In the future, we may enter into
	currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rates of our principal
	operating currencies. These measures, however, may not adequately protect us from the material adverse effects of such fluctuations.
	If the U.S. dollar cost of our operations increases, our U.S. dollar-measured results of operations will be adversely affected.

	a PFIC by making a &ldquo;qualified electing fund&rdquo;, or QEF, election, provided that we provide the information necessary
	for a U.S. investor to make such an election. We intend to make available to U.S. investors upon request the information necessary

	Our business headquarters, part of our senior
	management team and a number of our directors and employees are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military
	conditions in Israel may directly affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed
	conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, the Hamas militant group and the Hezbollah. Any hostilities
	involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our
	operations and results of operations. Since October 2000, there have been increasing occurrences of terrorist violence. In 2006,
	a conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah in Lebanon resulted in thousands of rockets being fired from Lebanon into Israel. In
	2008, Israel engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which involved missile strikes against Israel and negatively
	affected business conditions in Israel. In 2012 and 2014, Israel experienced a similar armed conflict, resulting in hundreds of
	rockets being fired from the Gaza Strip. Ongoing and revived hostilities or other Israeli political or economic factors, such as,
	an interruption of operations at the Tel Aviv airport, could prevent or delay shipments of our components or products. If continued
	or resumed, these hostilities may negatively affect business conditions in Israel in general and our business in particular. In
	the event that hostilities disrupt the ongoing operation of our facilities or the airports and seaports on which we depend to import
	and export our supplies and any product candidates, our operations may be materially adversely affected.

	In addition, since 2010 political uprisings
	and conflicts in various countries in the Middle East, including Egypt and Syria, are affecting the political stability of those
	countries. It is not clear how this instability will develop and how it will affect the political and security situation in the
	Middle East. This instability has raised concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict. Any potential
	future conflict could also include missile strikes against parts of Israel, including our offices and facilities. Such instability
	may lead to deterioration in the political and trade relationships that exist between the State of Israel and certain other countries.
	Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions, could
	harm our results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Parties with whom we do business may sometimes
	decline to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary
	in order to meet our business partners face to face. Several countries, principally in the Middle East, still restrict doing business
	with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies
	if hostilities in Israel or political instability in the region continues or increases. Similarly, Israeli companies are limited
	in conducting business with entities from countries that are considered to be in a state of war with Israel. In addition, the political
	and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that
	they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements.

	As a company incorporated under the law of
	the State of Israel, we are subject to Israeli corporate law. Israeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for
	acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors, officers or
	significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to such types of transactions. For example, a merger
	may not be consummated unless at least 50 days have passed from the date on which a merger proposal is filed by each merging company
	with the Israel Registrar of Companies and at least 30 days have passed from the date on which the shareholders of both merging
	companies have approved the merger. In addition, a majority of each class of securities of the target company must approve a merger.
	Moreover, a tender offer for all of a company&rsquo;s issued and outstanding shares can only be completed if the acquirer receives
	positive responses from the holders of at least 95% of the issued share capital. Completion of the tender offer also requires approval
	of and a majority of the offerees that do not have a personal interest in the tender offer approves the tender offer, unless, following
	consummation of the tender offer, the acquirer would hold at least 98% of the company&rsquo;s outstanding shares. Furthermore,
	the shareholders, including those who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer, may, at any time within six months following
	the completion of the tender offer, claim that the consideration for the acquisition of the shares does not reflect their fair
	market value, and petition an Israeli court to alter the consideration for the acquisition, unless accordingly, other than those
	who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer in case the acquirer stipulated in its tender offer that a shareholder that
	accepts the offer may not seek such appraisal rights., and the acquirer or the company published all required information with
	respect to the tender offer prior to the tender offer&rsquo;s response date. See Item 10.B - &ldquo;Articles of Associations -

	United States law must be proven as a fact by expert witnesses, which can be a time consuming and costly process. Certain matters
	of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel that addresses the matters described

	Trehalose is a protein stabilizer and an autophagy
	enhancer that activates lysosomal pathways. We have developed a proprietary high dose, trehalose 90mg/mL intravenous, or Trehalose
	IV, solution that allows trehalose to reach target organs and facilitate tissue penetration to the brain and muscles. Mutant unstable
	cellular proteins are the cause of several protein aggregation genetic diseases known as PolyA/PolyQ diseases, including OPMD,
	where mutant protein aggregates in muscle, and in SCA3 where mutant protein aggregates in the brain. These pathological proteins
	aggregate within cells and cell nuclei eventually leading to cell death. Data from the literature and from our nonclinical studies
	in both cell and animal models of disease indicate that trehalose may have the potential to prevent mutant protein aggregation
	and to enhance autophagy in human diseases, by stabilizing proteins, reducing the formation of protein aggregates, and promoting
	clearance of abnormal proteins or other storage materials thereby preventing cell death.

	In March 2016, we reported final results of
	our HOPEMD Phase 2a open-label study in which 25 patients with OPMD were treated with our Trehalose IV solution for 24 weeks using
	a weekly dose of 27 grams. Our Trehalose IV solution was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated, with no drug-related
	serious adverse events, and while not powered for efficacy, the study produced early efficacy signals. These efficacy signals related
	to the main symptoms of OPMD, such as dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), and muscle weakness. At the conclusion of the 24-week
	trial, patients were allowed to continue treatment for another 12 months. 22 patients of the original HOPEMD trial enrolled in
	this extension study (16 of whom continued to receive our Trehalose IV solution while six were in the non-treatment group), in
	which our Trehalose IV solution was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated. Patients who remained on our Trehalose IV
	solution remained stable with improved dysphagia and patients withdrawn from treatment had worsening of their dysphagia. In October
	2016, we reported the results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessing the pharmacokinetics of trehalose
	in 24 healthy volunteers (randomized 3:1 trehalose to placebo) to establish safety and tolerability of escalating doses of trehalose
	and to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), or maximum feasible dose, and assess pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of
	trehalose. Our Trehalose IV solution was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated at twice the 27 grams dose used in the
	HOPEMD clinical trial. The MTD was 54 grams administered by IV over 60 minutes. In January 2017, we reported the results of a Phase
	2a open-label study of 14 SCA3 patients for a six-month period; eight patients received a dose of 13.5 grams and six patients received
	a dose of 27 grams of our Trehalose IV solution on a weekly basis. (The study began with 15 patients; however, one patient withdrew
	after three weeks and prior to any efficacy assessment). Weekly Trehalose IV infusions of both doses were generally safe and well
	tolerated. There were no changes in any safety laboratory parameters with treatment. Patients remained stable with no change on
	the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, or SARA, score &ndash; a well-accepted clinical tool for measuring the effect of
	the disease &ndash; over the six-month period. Five patients received treatment for as long as 12 months and continued to remain
	stable on the SARA scale.

	Trehalose is a low molecular weight disaccharide
	(0.342 kilodaltons), which is a chemical molecule comprised of two sugar components that can prevent the folding of proteins and
	that buffer abnormal protein aggregation, thus protecting against pathological processes in cells. Trehalose has been shown to
	prevent pathological aggregation of proteins within cells in several diseases associated with abnormal cellular-protein aggregation
	as well as acting as an autophagy enhancer. Autophagy is the basic catabolic mechanism that involves cell-based degradation of
	unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components. Autophagy in healthy adults, or if regulated in those with abnormalities, ensures
	degradation and recycling of cellular components. Trehalose effectively reduced the aggregation and toxicity of
	mutant PABPN1 proteins in OPMD cell models. Furthermore, treatment of an OPMD in a mouse model with trehalose resulted in the attenuation
	of muscle weakness, decreased aggregate formation and a reduced number of TUNEL-positive nuclei in skeletal muscle fibers.

	Trehalose IV solution is our proprietary drug
	candidate for the treatment of OPMD, an ultra-rare, inherited myopathy. OPMD is a muscle disease caused by a primary defect in
	muscle cells as a result of aggregation of a protein called PABPN1. Overall worldwide prevalence of OPMD is estimated at 1:100,000.
	Characteristically to genetic diseases with autosomal inheritance, there are documented clusters of higher prevalence.
	For example, in people of French Canadian origin residing in Quebec, Canada, among Hispanics in Northern New Mexico, USA, and Bukhara
	Jews in Israel. The prevalence data collected suggest that the prevalence is approximately 1:1,000 patients among French Canadian,
	approximately 12:100,000 patients among Hispanics of Northern New Mexico, and approximately 1:600 patients among Bukhara Jews in
	Israel. We estimate that there are about 4,300 patients in the United States and Canada and overall about 12,000 patients around
	the world.

	OPMD is characterized by progressive muscle
	weakness that leads to development of symptoms including ptosis (dropping of eyelids), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) and
	proximal muscle weakness. As the dysphagia becomes more severe, patients may suffer from repeated incidents of aspiration pneumonia,
	may become malnourished (cachexia), and may develop tongue atrophy and speech difficulties (dysphonia). OPMD is caused by a genetic
	mutation responsible for the creation of a mutant protein (PABPN1) with an expanded polyalanine domain that aggregates within patient
	muscle cells. OPMD is one of a larger group of diseases called tri-nucleotide repeat diseases that are associated with the presence
	of an abnormal cellular protein that aggregates in the cells, eventually causing cell death. In OPMD, the mutant protein PABPN1
	was found to be correlated with disease severity in animal models and was identified within the typical cellular protein aggregates-the
	intranuclear inclusion body (INI) that is the diagnostic hallmark of the disease.

	SCA3, also known as Machado Joseph disease,
	a dominantly inherited ataxia, is the most common of the cerebellar ataxias, and is one of a group of genetic diseases that are
	characterized by memory deficits, spasticity, difficulty with speech and swallowing, weakness in arms and other muscular disorders.
	The prevalence of SCA3 is conservatively estimated at approximately 3-4 cases per 100,000 people in North America and Europe.
	The prevalence of the disease is highest among people of Portuguese/Azorean descent. For example, among immigrants of Portuguese
	ancestry in New England, the prevalence is approximately one in 4,000, and the highest prevalence in the world, about one in 140,
	occurs on the small Azorean island of Flores. There is no medical treatment for SCA3 and current approaches are focused on alleviating

	In most individuals with SCA3, symptoms typically
	begin in the third to fifth decade of life but can start as early as young childhood or as late as 70 years of age. Eventually
	SCA3 leads to paralysis, and severe cases can lead to an early death in the fourth decade of life. SCA3 is incurable, and there
	is currently no approved treatment for the disease.&nbsp;Natural history studies indicate that death occurs, on average, 21 years
	after diagnosis. SCA3 is caused by a mutation in the DNA that leads to the creation of a pathological protein&nbsp;called ataxin
	3. In affected patients, ataxin 3 is unstable, aggregates within the cells, and eventually leads to cell death.&nbsp;

	groups of eight patients each. In each group, six patients received trehalose and two patients received a placebo. The first group

	The secondary objectives were to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of trehalose.
	The key findings of the study were: (i) the MTD was determined to be 54 grams administered IV over 60 minutes, which is twice the
	level of drug that has been given to patients in our OPMD and SCA3 Phase 2a studies, (ii) 54 grams of trehalose administered over

	i.e. doubling the dose, doubled the exposure, (iv) the half-life of trehalose was approximately 1.5 hours and did not change when
	the dose was increased, (v) there was no effect on serum glucose levels during or following the infusion, and (vi) the rate of
	trehalose clearance from the blood was directly related to the patient&rsquo;s weight; i.e., the greater the weight the faster

	Peak serum concentration increased with increasing
	doses from 27 grams to 81 grams. The mean elimination half-life (t&frac12;) ranged from 1.41 hours to 1.59 hours and was consistent
	as the dose increased. In the 81-gram dose cohort, one subject out of six subjects who received trehalose had an increase in liver
	enzymes that resolved without treatment; thus no higher doses of trehalose were administered, thereby establishing the MTD for
	trehalose as 54 grams. There was a positive relationship between clearance of trehalose from the blood and body weight over a range
	of 50 kilograms (kg) to 100kg. This finding suggested that clearance is related to body size and thus, weight-based dosing, i.e.
	g/kg, would be more appropriate to achieve consistent exposure across a range of body weights in future studies.

	A total of 58 people have been exposed to trehalose:
	25 patients with OPMD, 15 patients with SCA3 and 18 healthy subjects, with some patients having been on the drug for more than
	18 months. These patients and healthy volunteers have received a total of more than 2,200 doses of Trehalose IV, representing a
	total of more than 56,000 grams. Overall, trehalose has been well tolerated in all 58 people, with no infusion reactions being
	reported and no safety signals identified. No adverse event has led to discontinuation of the study drug, or drug related death.

	Nonclinical toxicology studies have shown that
	trehalose is generally safe and well tolerated, is not genotoxic, and there is no CYP450 inhibition in drug-drug interaction analysis.
	Such nonclinical toxicology studies included two short-term 3-months studies in dogs and rats using a dose of 3.6 g/kg which were
	completed, and two chronic toxicity studies. Chronic toxicology studies were performed at a dose range of 2.7 g/kg through 10.8g/kg
	and include a 6-months rat study (in which the in-life phase was terminated at 5 months due to catheter complications) and an on-going
	9-month dog study for which the 6-months interim report had no negative findings. The six-month rat study report showed that there
	was no systemic toxicity, at any dose studied, of trehalose. However, there was increased incidence of procedural-related (indwelling
	catheters) complications with increasing doses of trehalose, thus suggesting that trehalose infusion may exacerbate this procedure-related
	event. Indwelling catheters have not been used and are not permitted in the clinical trials of trehalose.

	The commercialization of new drugs is competitive,
	and we may face worldwide competition from individual investigators, major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies,
	biotechnology companies and ultimately biosimilar and generic companies. Our competitors may develop or market therapies that are
	more effective, safer, or less costly than any that may be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their therapies
	more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and
	human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources
	being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability
	of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability
	to build and actively manage a portfolio of indication-specific trehalose products that addresses unmet medical needs and creates
	value in patient therapy.

	An IND is a request for authorization from

	the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before

	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically

	Additionally, before approving an NDA, the
	FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing
	process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional
	testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did
	not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be
	excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested

	The FDA also has authority to require a Risk

	its risks. A sponsor may also propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review
	of the NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include &ldquo;Dear Doctor&rdquo; letters, a Medication
	Guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs and in some cases restrictions on distribution. These elements are negotiated
	as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases if consensus is not obtained until after the Prescription Drug User Fee Act review
	cycle, the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.&nbsp;

	so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific

	In the European Union, governments influence
	the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules, legislation and control of national health
	care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative
	list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain
	reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness
	of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices
	for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription
	drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition,
	in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.&nbsp;

	In Canada, the federal government, provinces and territories
	provide coverage to about one third of residents through publicly financed programs. Both the federal and provincial governments
	play a role in regulating drug prices and reimbursement. The prices of patented drugs are regulated at the federal level by the
	Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which ensures that prices are not excessive. Also, drugs must be approved at the provincial
	level in order to be covered under provincial health insurance systems. Once Health Canada has approved a drug for use, the country&rsquo;s
	public drug plans must decide if the drug will be eligible for public reimbursement. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies
	in Health (CADTH), an independent non-profit agency has a mandate to provide advice and evidence-based information about the effectiveness
	of drugs and other health technologies to Canadian health care decision makers. CADTH implements a Common Drug Review (CDR) process
	to provide formulary recommendations for all provinces except Quebec. Through the CDR process, CADTH conducts evaluations of the
	clinical, economic, and patient evidence on drugs, and uses this evaluation to provide reimbursement recommendations and advice
	to Canada&rsquo;s federal, provincial, and territorial public drug plans, with the exception of Quebec. About two-thirds of Canada&rsquo;s
	residents are covered for prescription drugs by private insurance. Private plans establish their own lists of covered drugs.

	The marketability of any products for which
	we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if governmental and other third-party payers fail to provide adequate
	coverage and reimbursement. In addition, there is an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and
	other countries, which we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party
	reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products
	for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

	The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing

	relating to safety and efficacy of a drug that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to actively market
	a drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising
	or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure
	to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, enforcement letters, such as publicly-posted warning letters,
	corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties. Government regulators recently have increased their
	scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs. These federal enforcement actions can also potentially lead to state actions

	Our headquarters are currently located in Tel

	2014, with an option to extend the lease for two additional consecutive three-year periods. During December 2016, we exercised
	the option to extend the lease for an additional three years period through 2020, while maintaining the right to terminate the
	lease agreement under certain conditions during the extended lease term. During 2015 and 2016, we leased U.S. office facilities

	As of October 2016, we terminated these lease agreements and vacated these locations.

	We are a clinical stage biotechnology company
	committed to developing meaningful therapies for patients with rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. Currently our focus is on
	Trehalose IV, a therapeutic platform that offers potential solutions for several diseases that share a common pathophysiological
	mechanism, which are the functional changes that accompany a particular syndrome or disease. Since our inception in 2012, our work
	with trehalose has centered around two diseases, OPMD and SCA3. We also address diseases with severe and debilitating manifestations,
	where the unmet medical need is clear, the biological mechanism of action is understood, and for which there is no satisfactory
	treatment.

	To date, we have not generated
	revenue from the sale of any product, and we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain
	marketing approval of, and commercialize our product candidate. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of
	$39.81 million. Our financing activities are described below under &ldquo;Liquidity and Capital Resources&rdquo;. We expect
	to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to
	incur substantial expenses related to product development, clinical and nonclinical studies, regulatory filling and, if
	approved, commercial launch of our product candidate. These losses, combined with prior losses will continue to have an
	adverse effect on our cash resources, shareholders&rsquo; deficit and working capital. As a result of these expected losses
	and negative cash flows from operations, along with our current cash position, we only have sufficient resources to fund
	operations at least until the end of second quarter of 2017. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to
	continue as a going concern.

	If we obtain regulatory approval for our product
	candidate and any future product candidates we may develop, we may incur significant sales, marketing, in-licensing and outsourced
	manufacturing expenses, as well as continued research and development expenses. In addition, we expect our research and development
	expenses to significantly increase in connection with our planned additional Phase 2b clinical trial of Trehalose IV for treatment
	of OPMD patients and other planned clinical trials of our Trehalose IV solution for treatments of other indications, and as we
	develop additional product candidates for our drug pipeline. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing
	and commercializing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable,
	if at all.&nbsp;

	Until such time, if ever, as we can generate
	substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings,
	as well as license and collaboration agreements with potential partners. We may be unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive
	terms, or to enter into collaboration agreements, which could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development
	or future commercialization efforts. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which we may not be
	able to achieve.

	Research and development expenses consist of
	expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including compensation and benefits (which includes share
	based compensation for research and development employees), an allocation of facilities expenses, overhead expenses, nonclinical
	pharmacology and toxicology studies, manufacturing process-development, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses,
	fees paid to CROs, investigative sites, and other external expenses. In the early phases of development, our research and development
	costs include expanding our product platform as well as early development of specific product candidates. As we expand the clinical
	development of our Trehalose IV solution, we expect the amount of research and development spending to continue to grow. The majority
	of our research and development expenses are spent on the development of our Trehalose IV solution.

	We expense research and development costs as
	incurred. Conducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model. Product candidates in advanced
	stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily
	due to the increased size and duration of advanced stage clinical trials. We plan to increase our research and development expenses
	for the foreseeable future as we seek to obtain regulatory approval for our Trehalose IV solution in the United States and rest
	of the world as well as to expand the indications for our Trehalose IV solution, and to further advance our nonclinical and earlier
	stage research and development projects into clinical stages. The successful development of our Trehalose IV solution for treatment
	of OPMD patients and other indications is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs
	of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our Trehalose IV solution, or the period,
	if any, in which material net cash inflows from this product candidates may commence. Clinical development timelines, the probability
	of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority
	were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of
	clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials, we could be required
	to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.

	For the year ended December 31, 2016, our general
	and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $1.05 million, or 15%, compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily
	due to our decision to downsize corporate overhead by reducing the number of employees of our wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary and
	closing of U.S. offices. The general and administrative costs during 2016 included termination related payments to departing employees.
	Such termination related payments were offset by reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation due to forfeiture of
	options previously granted to departing employees.

	allowance against net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be able

	other early phase clinical trials to test our Trehalose IV solution in other indications, which is subject to

	that may currently be unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future

	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial

	and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of and during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed
	by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates

	Options granted under the 2013 Plan to
	Israeli employees have been granted under the capital gains track of Section 102 of the Ordinance. Section 102 of the Ordinance
	allows employees, directors and officers, who are not controlling shareholders and are considered Israeli residents, to receive
	favorable tax treatment for compensation in the form of shares or options. Our Israeli non-employee service providers and controlling
	shareholders may only be granted options under Section 3(i) of the Ordinance, which does not provide for similar tax benefits.
	Section 102 of the Ordinance includes two alternatives for tax treatment involving the issuance of options or shares to a trustee
	for the benefit of the grantees and also includes an additional alternative for the issuance of options or shares directly to the
	grantee. Section 102(b)(2) of the Ordinance, the most favorable tax treatment for grantees, permits the issuance to a trustee under
	the &ldquo;capital gains track.&rdquo; However, under this track we are not allowed to deduct an expense with respect to the issuance
	of the options or shares. In order to comply with the terms of the capital gains track, all options granted under the 2013 Plan
	pursuant and subject to the provisions of Section 102 of the Ordinance, as well as the Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise of
	these options and other shares received subsequently following any realization of rights with respect to such options, such as
	share dividends and share splits, must be granted to a trustee for the benefit of the relevant employee, director or officer and
	should be held by the trustee for at least two years after the date of the grant.

	The Companies Law requires that an office
	holder promptly disclose to the Board of Directors any personal interest that he or she may have concerning any existing or proposed
	transaction with a company, as well as any substantial information or document with respect thereof. An interested office holder's
	disclosure must be made promptly and in any event no later than the first meeting of the Board of Directors at which the transaction
	is considered. A personal interest includes an interest of any person in an act or transaction of a company, including a personal
	interest of one's relative or of a corporate body in which such person or a relative of such person is a 5% or greater shareholder,
	director or general manager or in which he or she has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager, but excluding
	a personal interest stemming from one's ownership of shares in the company. A personal interest furthermore includes the personal
	interest of a person for whom the office holder holds a voting proxy or the interest of the office holder with respect to his or
	her vote on behalf of the shareholder for whom he or she holds a proxy even if such shareholder itself has no personal interest
	in the approval of the matter. An office holder is not, however, obliged to disclose a personal interest if it derives solely from
	the personal interest of a relative of such office holder in a transaction that is not considered an extraordinary transaction.
	Under the Companies Law, an extraordinary transaction is defined as any of the following:

	If it is determined that an office holder
	has a personal interest in a transaction, approval by the Board of Directors is required for the transaction, unless the company's
	articles of association provide for a different method of approval. Further, so long as an office holder has disclosed his or her
	personal interest in a transaction, the Board of Directors may approve an action by the office holder that would otherwise be deemed
	a breach of duty of loyalty. However, a company may not approve a transaction or action that is adverse to the company's interest
	or that is not performed by the office holder in good faith. Approval first by the company's Audit Committee and subsequently by
	the Board of Directors is required for an extraordinary transaction in which an office holder has a personal interest. Arrangements
	regarding the compensation, indemnification or insurance of an office holder require the approval of the Compensation Committee,
	Board of Directors and, in certain circumstances, the shareholders, in that order.

	Pursuant to Israeli law, the disclosure
	requirements regarding personal interests that apply to directors and executive officers also apply to a controlling shareholder
	of a public company. In the context of a transaction involving a controlling shareholder or an officer who is a controlling shareholder
	of the company, a controlling shareholder also includes any shareholder who holds 25% or more of the voting rights if no other
	shareholder holds more than 50% of the voting rights. Two or more shareholders with a personal interest in the approval of the
	same transaction are deemed to be a single shareholder and may be deemed a controlling shareholder for the purpose of approving
	such transaction. Extraordinary transactions, including private placement transactions, with a controlling shareholder or in which
	a controlling shareholder has a personal interest, and engagements with a controlling shareholder or his or her relative, directly
	or indirectly, including through a corporation in his or her control, require the approval of the Audit Committee, the Board of
	Directors and the shareholders of the company, in that order.&nbsp;In addition, the shareholder approval must fulfill one of the

	for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of a distribution that exceeds our earnings and profits will be treated first
	as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s tax basis for the Ordinary Shares to the extent thereof, and
	then capital gain. Corporate holders generally will not be allowed a deduction for dividends received. For noncorporate U.S. Holders,
	to the extent that their total adjusted income does not exceed applicable thresholds, the maximum federal income tax rate for &ldquo;qualified

	exceeds such income thresholds, the maximum federal income tax rate for &ldquo;qualified dividend income&rdquo; and long-term capital
	gains is generally 20%. For this purpose, &ldquo;qualified dividend income&rdquo; means, inter alia, dividends received from a

	Distributions paid by us will generally
	be foreign source income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to the limitations set forth in the Code, U.S. Holders may
	elect to claim a foreign tax credit against their U.S. income tax liability for Israeli income tax withheld from distributions
	received in respect of the Ordinary Shares. In general, these rules limit the amount allowable as a foreign tax credit in any year
	to the amount of regular U.S. tax for the year attributable to foreign source taxable income. This limitation on the use of foreign
	tax credits generally will not apply to an electing individual U.S. Holder whose creditable foreign taxes during the year do not
	exceed $300, or $600 for joint filers, if such individual&rsquo;s gross income for the taxable year from non-U.S. sources consists
	solely of certain passive income. A U.S. Holder will be denied a foreign tax credit with respect to Israeli income tax withheld
	from dividends received with respect to the Ordinary Shares if such U.S. Holder has not held the Ordinary Shares for at least 16
	days out of the 31-day period beginning on the date that is 15 days before the ex-dividend date or to the extent that such U.S.
	Holder is under an obligation to make certain related payments with respect to substantially similar or related property. Any day
	during which a U.S. Holder has substantially diminished his or her risk of loss with respect to the Ordinary Shares will not count
	toward meeting the 16-day holding period. A U.S. Holder will also be denied a foreign tax credit if the U.S. Holder holds the Ordinary
	Shares in an arrangement in which the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s reasonably expected economic profit is insubstantial compared to the
	foreign taxes expected to be paid or accrued. The rules relating to the determination of the U.S. foreign tax credit are complex,
	and U.S. Holders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine whether, and to what extent, they are entitled to such
	credit. U.S. Holders that do not elect to claim a foreign tax credit may instead claim a deduction for Israeli income taxes withheld,
	provided such U.S. Holders itemize their deductions.

	Audit Committee pre-approves annually a catalog of specific audit and non-audit services in the categories of audit services, audit-related
	services and tax services that may be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. If a type of service, that

	Shareholder approval.
</I>
	We will seek shareholder approval for
	all corporate actions requiring such approval under the requirements of the Companies Law, rather than seeking approval for corporation
	actions in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule&nbsp;5635. In particular, under this NASDAQ rule, shareholder approval is generally
	required for: (i)&nbsp;an acquisition of shares/assets of another company that involves the issuance of 20% or more of the acquirer's
	shares or voting rights or if a director, officer or 5% shareholder has greater than a 5% interest in the target company or the
	consideration to be received; (ii)&nbsp;the issuance of shares leading to a change of control; (iii)&nbsp;adoption/amendment of
	equity compensation arrangements; and (iv)&nbsp;issuances of 20% or more of the shares or voting rights (including securities convertible
	into, or exercisable for, equity) of a listed company via a private placement (and/or via sales by directors/officers/5% shareholders)
	if such equity is issued (or sold) at below the greater of the book or market value of shares. By contrast, under the Companies
	Law, shareholder approval is required for, among other things: (i)&nbsp;transactions with directors concerning the terms of their

	We conducted our

	We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
	of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
	but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
	Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
	in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the management,
	and evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
	for our opinion.

	The accompanying
	consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully
	described in Note 1, the Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operating activities during the year
	ended December 31, 2016. Its ability to continue to operate is dependent upon obtaining additional financial support. These conditions
	as described in Note 1, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial
	statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets
	or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Bioblast Pharma Ltd. (the &ldquo;Parent&rdquo;)
	was incorporated in Israel and commenced its operations on January 22, 2012. In January 2015, Bioblast Pharma Inc. was established
	in the state of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary (the &ldquo;Subsidiary&rdquo;). The Parent and the Subsidiary (together the
	&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) are a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to developing clinically meaningful therapies for patients
	with rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. The Company focuses on trehalose, a therapeutic platform that potentially offers solutions
	for several diseases that share a common pathophysiological mechanism, which are the functional changes that accompany a particular
	syndrome or disease. The Company focuses on diseases with severe and debilitating manifestations, where the unmet medical need
	is clear, the biological mechanism of action is understood, and for which there is no satisfactory treatment. Since inception in
	2012, the Company has been engaged in the development of potential treatments using trehalose for two diseases, oculopharyngeal
	muscular dystrophy (&ldquo;OPMD&rdquo;) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3; Machado Joseph disease). The Company&rsquo;s ordinary
	shares (&ldquo;Ordinary shares&rdquo;) are traded on the NASDAQ Global Market.&nbsp;

	and successfully commercializes its products. Since its inception, the Company has financed its operations through issuance of
	preferred shares, its initial public offering (the &ldquo;IPO&rdquo;) and a subsequent registered direct offering. The Company
	recorded a net loss of $16,022 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016 and as of December 31, 2016, the Company had an
	accumulated deficit of $39,809 thousand. As of December 31, 2016, the Company&rsquo;s cash and short-term bank deposits were $9,878
	thousand.&nbsp;Additional funding beyond its existing cash resources will be required to entirely cover the cost of the Company&rsquo;s
	planned Phase 2b study in OPMD patients and the underlying expense of the Company&rsquo;s operations while the study is ongoing.
	The Company plans to continue to fund its losses from operations and capital funding needs through the issuance of equity and/or
	debt or through collaborations or license agreements with other companies. Equity or debt financing may not be available on a timely
	basis on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is not able to secure adequate additional funding, the Company
	may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, or suspend
	or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm the Company&rsquo;s business, results of operations and
	future prospects.

	The Company recognizes, as expense, the estimated fair value

	attribution approach over the vesting period of the award. In periods that the Company grants Ordinary share options, fair value
	assumptions are based on volatility, interest, dividend yield, and expected term over which the Ordinary share options will be
	outstanding. The computation of expected volatility is based on an average historical share price volatility based on an analysis
	of reported data for a peer group of comparable publicly traded companies, which were selected based upon industry similarities.
	The interest rate for periods within the expected term of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury risk-free interest rate in effect
	at the time of grant. The expected lives of the options were estimated using the simplified method.

	Leases
</I>
	(&quot;ASC 842&quot;), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and
	disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual
	approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively
	a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective
	interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use
	asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with
	a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires
	lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct
	financing leases and operating leases. The ASU is expected to impact our consolidated financial statements as we have certain operating
	lease arrangements. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840 Leases. The standard is effective on January&nbsp;1,
	2019, with early adoption permitted.

	As permitted under Israeli law, the

	obligations and, consequently, concluded that the fair value of these obligations is negligible, and no related reserves were established.

	and nonqualified Ordinary share options to employees, directors, and nonemployees of the Company. As of December 31, 2016, the
	Company granted a total of 3,345,960 options to purchase Ordinary shares. Option awards generally expire 10 years from the grant
	date and generally vest over four&nbsp;years, but vesting conditions can vary at the discretion of the Company&rsquo;s board of
	directors (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;). As of December 31, 2016, 694,179 shares of Ordinary shares remain available for future grants
	under the 2013 Plan.

	When realization of a deferred tax asset
	is more likely than not to occur, the benefit related to the deductible temporary differences attributable to operations is recognized

	evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized
	in future periods. The Company cannot be certain that future Israeli taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred
	tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been provided against its Israeli net deferred tax assets. The Company
