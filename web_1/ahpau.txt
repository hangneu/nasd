	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp. is a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed
	for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this
	prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or
	indirectly, with any business combination target. We intend to focus our search for a target business in the healthcare industry.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=1>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
	is an initial public offering of our securities. Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and one warrant. Each warrant entitles
	the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share. Two warrants may be exercised for one whole Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to
	adjustment as provided herein. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a
	holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to be issued to the
	warrant holder. As a result, warrant holders not purchasing an even number of warrants must sell any odd number of warrants in order to obtain any value from the fractional interest that will not be
	issued. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30&nbsp;days after the completion of our initial business combination and 12&nbsp;months from the closing of this offering, and will
	expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation, as described in this prospectus. We have also granted the underwriters a 45-day
	option to purchase up to an additional 4,500,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=1>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination
	at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account described below as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business
	combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares that were sold as part of the units in this
	offering, which we refer to collectively as our public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24&nbsp;months from
	the closing of this offering, we will redeem 100% of the public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest
	(less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as
	further described herein.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=1>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	initial shareholders have committed to purchase an aggregate of 16,000,000 warrants (or 17,800,000 warrants if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a
	price of $0.50 per warrant ($8,000,000 in the aggregate or $8,900,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will close
	simultaneously with the closing of this offering. We refer to these warrants throughout this prospectus as the private placement warrants. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to
	purchase one-half of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share. Two private placement warrants are exercisable to purchase one whole Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as
	provided herein.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
	to this offering, Avista Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (which we refer to as our "sponsor" throughout this prospectus), purchased 8,625,000 Class&nbsp;B
	ordinary shares (up to 1,125,000 of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised). The Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares will
	automatically convert into Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as
	provided herein. In the case that additional Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in this offering and related to the
	closing of the business combination, the ratio at which Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares shall convert into Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the
	outstanding Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares agree to waive such anti-dilution adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares
	issuable upon conversion of all Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, 20% of the sum of all Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of this offering, plus all
	Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be
	issued, to any seller in the business combination. Holders of the Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares will have the right to elect all of our directors prior to our initial business combination. On any
	other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, holders of the Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares and holders of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will vote together as a single class, except as
	required by law.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
	to this offering, there has been no public market for our units, Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants. We have applied to list our units on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or
	NASDAQ, under the symbol "AHPAU" on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing
	on NASDAQ. The Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd&nbsp;day following the date of this prospectus unless Credit Suisse Securities
	(USA)&nbsp;LLC informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our filing a Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC,
	containing an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds of this offering and issuing a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the securities
	comprising the units begin separate trading, we expect that the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols "AHPA" and "AHPAW," respectively.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	founders are two of the founders and managing partners of Avista. Avista is a middle market private equity firm focused on control buyout and growth investments in the healthcare,
	communications and industrial sectors, with offices in New York, Houston and London. Thompson Dean, our Executive Chairman, and David Burgstahler, our President and Chief Executive Officer, were two
	of the founders of Avista in 2005. Our founders have worked together for over 20&nbsp;years. Over the past 10&nbsp;years, Avista has raised four private equity funds (Avista Capital
	Partners&nbsp;I,&nbsp;II, III and IV&nbsp;L.P.) and had approximately $6&nbsp;billion in assets under management as of June&nbsp;30, 2016. We expect that Avista will raise additional funds
	and / or successor funds in the future.
</FONT>

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	management team has significant experience sourcing, analyzing, acquiring and operating healthcare related businesses. Since inception, Avista funds have invested in
	15&nbsp;healthcare portfolio companies.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
	we may acquire a target business in any industry or location, our initial focus will be to acquire and operate a North American or European healthcare-related business. AHPAC will
	target businesses in the healthcare industry that it considers to have strong management teams, stable cash flows and robust growth prospects. We believe that we derive significant benefit from our
	management team and board members (the "AHPAC team") as well as our affiliation with Avista. We believe that the AHPAC team brings a distinctive blend of private equity investing experience, deal
	sourcing capabilities and operating expertise. Our team has extensive experience not only identifying and executing such acquisitions, but also running and operating the businesses post transaction.
	In addition, the AHPAC team has significant experience working with private companies to reshape their operations and help drive value creation. Not all of such companies have achieved the same level
	of value creation.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	believe that the AHPAC team is well positioned to identify attractive acquisition candidates because of their extensive contacts and transaction sources, including a broad list of
	industry executives, public board members, private owners, wealthy families, private capital managers, private equity funds, investment bankers and other transaction intermediaries. A central
	component of our acquisition strategy is our management team's ability to implement value creation initiatives designed to drive shareholder value as they have done in the past for Avista portfolio
	companies, not all of which have achieved the same level of shareholder value. The AHPAC team blends financial sophistication, operating perspective and business management skills to execute on these
	initiatives.

	Banking Partners ("DLJMB") for 10&nbsp;years. Mr.&nbsp;Dean served as Managing Partner of DLJMB I, II and III and DLJ Growth Capital Partners, and he was Chairman of their respective Investment
	Committees until his departure in 2005. Under Mr.&nbsp;Dean's leadership at DLJMB, members of the Avista team sourced, led and/or were substantially involved in 56 private equity investments and
	under his leadership at Avista the team has made 49 private equity investments.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David
	Burgstahler, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has more than 20&nbsp;years of experience in private equity. Prior to co-founding Avista Capital Partners in 2005,
	Mr.&nbsp;Burgstahler was a Partner of DLJMB and Head of Global Healthcare. Mr.&nbsp;Burgstahler joined Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette
	("DLJ") in 1995 and was with DLJMB from 1997 to 2005. Mr.&nbsp;Burgstahler has played a key leadership role in originating and/or executing 14 private equity backed investments during his career.
	Through his involvement at the board level, he has helped some of these portfolio companies reshape their operations and strategy with add-on acquisitions and, in many cases, utilized his operating
	and strategy formulation experience to refine and optimize their business strategies. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Burgstahler has helped several portfolio companies prepare for and execute their initial
	public offerings.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with this strategy, AHPAC intends to target businesses in the healthcare industry that we consider to have strong management
	teams, stable cash flows and robust growth prospects. AHPAC believes that the healthcare industry will experience growth over the foreseeable future as a result of global economic growth and long-term
	demographic drivers such as: the aging population in the developed world; steady global growth in medical procedures; improving healthcare standards worldwide with a focus on continued innovation in

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide
	healthcare spending has experienced strong growth, rising to an estimated $7.3&nbsp;trillion in 2015, representing a growth of 2.9% annually over the past five years
	(2010-2015). We believe the healthcare industry will continue its strong growth, driven by the continued aging of the global population, increased prevalence of chronic disease states, increased
	demand for higher standards of healthcare, especially in the emerging economies, and new product innovation and investment in research and development. Given these factors, total global healthcare
	spending is expected to grow by 5.6% annually over the 2016-2019 period. U.S. healthcare spending, in particular, is projected to increase to approximately 17.2% of gross domestic product and remain

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the pharmaceutical sector, demographics and disease trends have continued to boost long-term drug consumption globally. In the United States, the expansion of insurance coverage via
	health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion is projected to increase revenues for pharmaceutical companies; however, greater scrutiny of branded drug pricing is likely to persist for the
	foreseeable future. Many national healthcare systems continue to encourage greater use of generic drugs due to ongoing government budgetary pressures, creating significant growth opportunities for
	generic pharmaceutical companies. We believe that fast-growing emerging markets also provide a source of long-term and sustained growth opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry, driven by
	increasing wealth and awareness of health issues in these markets. In order to exploit these growth opportunities, and to drive operating and tax efficiencies, many pharmaceutical companies have
	pursued aggressive acquisition strategies in recent years, and we expect consolidation to remain a core theme in the years to come in the pharmaceutical sector.

	increased investment into emerging markets and pipelines. We intend to target companies with differentiated technologies and IP positions, strong innovation capabilities, exposure to new product
	cycles, and an increasing emerging market focus. In particular, we believe that the robust industry consolidation in recent years will create strong buying opportunities in 2016 and beyond as larger

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

	Pharmaceutical and medical device companies turn to outsourcing to access the greater global infrastructure, enhanced efficiency (in cost and speed) along with the therapeutic expertise that the
	contract research organization brings. We believe that outsourced research spending will continue to grow over the next five years due to the underlying demand.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing

	medical treatments. Average annual growth of out-of-pocket health care expenditure is projected to rise to approximately 5.0% by 2023 from 3.2% in 2013. We believe the trend towards the consumer
	directing more healthcare buying decisions will benefit over-the-counter, dietary supplements, functional foods and other personal care consumer products companies.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	currently do not have any specific business combination under consideration. Our officers and directors have neither individually identified or considered a target business for our
	initial business combination nor have they had any discussions regarding possible target businesses amongst themselves or with our underwriters or other advisors. All of the members of our management
	team are employed by Avista. Avista is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a business combination, but we have not (nor has
	anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction. We have not (nor have any of our agents
	or affiliates) been approached by any candidates (or representative of any candidates) with respect to a possible acquisition transaction with us and we will not consider a business combination with
	any company that has already been identified to Avista as a suitable acquisition candidate for it. Additionally, we have
	not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any measure, directly or indirectly, to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for us, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other
	representative to identify or locate any such acquisition candidate.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avista
	manages several investment vehicles, and we expect that Avista will raise additional funds and/or successor funds in the future, which may be during the period in which we are
	seeking our initial business combination. The Avista funds and their portfolio companies may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. In particular, Avista funds currently manage nine portfolio
	companies focused on the healthcare industry. These portfolio companies may be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financing at any time. We may compete with any one or more of them on any
	given acquisition opportunity. However, we do not expect to directly compete with these Avista entities in seeking our initial business combination, primarily due to the anticipated differences in the
	expected size of the equity investment by any such Avista entity in an acquisition and by us in our initial business combination; the later stage of Avista's investment in many of these entities; and
	the public nature of our acquisition strategy. In addition, all of our officers and certain of our directors have fiduciary and contractual duties to Avista. As a result, these officers and directors
	may have a duty to offer acquisition opportunities to certain Avista funds or portfolio companies subject to their fiduciary duties as a matter of Cayman Islands law. If these funds decide to pursue
	any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Avista may be suitable for both us and for a current or future Avista fund or
	portfolio company and may be directed to such fund or portfolio company rather than to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. Neither Avista nor members of our management team who are also
	employed by Avista have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware solely in their capacities as officers or managing directors
	of Avista. Avista and/or our management, in their capacities as officers or managing directors of Avista or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the
	related entities described above, current or future Avista investment vehicles, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. Avista will
	determine which entity will be allocated any such business opportunity based on a number of factors, including the size of the target business and potential synergies with existing businesses. We do
	not expect these duties to present a significant conflict of interest with our search for an initial business combination. Avista's traditional private equity activities typically involve investing in
	private companies, and while Avista will often take companies public, it typically invests in those entities several years prior to an initial public offering, not at the time of such offering.

	Initial Business Combination
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an
	aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a
	definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses,
	we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not
	intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity
	interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such
	interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination
	if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be
	required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of
	the voting securities of the
	target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the
	business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In
	this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial
	business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business
	or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets
	test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in Section&nbsp;2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
	Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are
	applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of
	Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
	reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not
	previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more
	volatile.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, Section&nbsp;107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B)
	of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
	would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year (a)&nbsp;following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering,
	(b)&nbsp;in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0&nbsp;billion, or (c)&nbsp;in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our
	ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700&nbsp;million as of the prior June&nbsp;30th, and (2)&nbsp;the date on which we have issued more than $1.0&nbsp;billion in
	non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to "emerging growth company" shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

	In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the
	backgrounds of the members of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company and the fact that this offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule&nbsp;419
	promulgated under the Securities Act. You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule&nbsp;419 blank check offerings. You should carefully consider these and the other
	risks set forth in the section below entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page&nbsp;34 of this prospectus.

	Each warrant offered in this offering is exercisable to purchase one-half of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share, subject to adjustment as
	provided herein. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a
	fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. As a result, warrant holders not purchasing an even number of warrants must
	sell any odd number of warrants in order to obtain any value from the fractional interest that will not be issued.

	We structured each warrant to be exercisable for one-half of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share, as compared to warrants issued by some other
	similar blank check companies which are exercisable for one whole share, in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination as compared to units that each contain a warrant to purchase one whole share,
	thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses.

	If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
	warrants to do so on a "cashless basis." In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a "cashless basis," our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding
	and the dilutive effect on our shareholders of issuing the maximum number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number
	of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)&nbsp;the product of the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the "fair market value" (defined below) over the
	exercise price of the warrants by (y)&nbsp;the fair market value. The "fair market value" shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on

	In December 2015, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or
	approximately $0.003 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by our sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash
	contributed to us by the number of founder shares issued. In September 2016, our sponsor transferred 50,000 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at their original per share purchase price. In addition, at such time, each of our
	independent directors purchased an additional 421,250 founder shares from our sponsor at their original purchase price. These additional shares are subject to forfeiture on a pro rata basis with the shares held by our sponsor to the extent the
	underwriters' over-allotment option is not exercised in full. If, prior to our initial business combination, any independent director resigns from our board of directors for any reason or is removed from our board of directors for cause, Thompson
	Dean and David Burgstahler will have the right to repurchase such independent director's additional shares at their original per share purchase price. Our initial shareholders will collectively own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after this
	offering (assuming they do not purchase units in this offering). If we increase or decrease the size of the offering, we will effect a capitalization or share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our
	Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of founder shares by our initial shareholders at 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon the consummation of
	this offering. Up to 1,125,000 founder shares are subject to forfeiture by our initial shareholders depending on the extent to which the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised.

	from our board of directors for cause, Thompson Dean and David Burgstahler will have the right to repurchase such independent director's private placement
	warrants at their original purchase price. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one-half of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at a price of $5.75 per one-half share (or two private placement warrants for one whole Class&nbsp;A
	ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share), subject to adjustment as provided herein. Private placement warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares. If any fractional interests would be issuable upon exercise of a private
	placement warrant, we will round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to be issued to the holder. The purchase price of the private placement warrants will be added to the proceeds from this offering to be held
	in the trust account. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of this offering, the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account will be used to fund the
	redemption of our public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement warrants will not be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our initial shareholders
	or their permitted transferees (except as described below under "Principal Shareholders&#151;Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants"). If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the initial shareholders or
	their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering. Our initial shareholders, as well as their
	permitted transferees, have the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis.

	There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. The NASDAQ rules
	require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes

	If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain
	an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm. We will complete our initial business combination only if the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own
	shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
	Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company,
	depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the
	portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test, provided that in the event that our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of

	Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply

	initial business combination either (i)&nbsp;in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii)&nbsp;by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed
	business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder
	approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue
	more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender
	offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.

	pursuant to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares or public shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires founder shares through a
	permitted transfer from an initial shareholder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares in this offering or thereafter through

	Avista manages several investment vehicles, and we expect that Avista will raise additional funds and/or successor funds in the future,
	which may be during the period in which we are seeking our initial business combination. The Avista funds and their portfolio companies may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. In particular, Avista funds currently manage nine portfolio
	companies focused on the healthcare industry. These portfolio companies may be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financing at any time. We may compete with any one or more of them on any given acquisition opportunity. However, we do not
	expect to directly compete with these Avista entities in seeking our initial business combination, primarily due to the anticipated differences in the expected size of the equity investment by any such Avista entity in an acquisition and by us in our
	initial business combination; the later stage of Avista's investment in many of these entities; and the public nature of our acquisition strategy. In addition, all of our officers and certain of our directors have fiduciary and contractual duties to
	Avista. As a result, these officers and directors may have a duty to offer acquisition opportunities to certain Avista funds or portfolio companies subject to their fiduciary duties as a matter of Cayman Islands law. If these funds decide to pursue
	any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Avista may be suitable for both us and for a current or future Avista fund or portfolio company and may be directed to such
	fund or portfolio company rather than to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. Neither Avista nor members of our management team who are also employed by Avista have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business
	combination of which they become aware solely in their capacities as officers or managing directors of Avista. Avista and/or our management, in their capacities as officers or managing directors of Avista or in their other endeavors, may choose to
	present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future Avista investment vehicles, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. Avista will
	determine which entity will be allocated any such business opportunity based on a number of factors, including the size of the target business and potential synergies with existing businesses.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of June&nbsp;30, 2016, we had $106,062 in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficiency of $503,651. Further, we
	expect to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. Management's plans to address this need for capital through this offering are discussed in the section of this prospectus titled
	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Our plans to raise capital and to consummate our initial business combination may not be successful. These
	factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus do not include any adjustments that

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may not hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination unless the business combination would require
	shareholder approval under applicable Cayman Islands law or the rules of NASDAQ or if we decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons. For instance, the NASDAQ rules currently allow
	us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a shareholder meeting but would still require us to obtain shareholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares to a
	target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek
	shareholder approval of such business combination. However, except as required by law, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a
	proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as
	the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may consummate our initial business combination even if
	holders of a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we consummate. Please see the section entitled "Proposed Business&#151;Effecting Our Initial
	Business Combination&#151;Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination" for additional information.

	of our initial business combination. We expect that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares at the time of any such
	shareholder vote. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more likely that the necessary shareholder approval will be received than would be the case if

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition
	that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result,
	would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the
	deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC's "penny stock" rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained
	in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or
	such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate
	business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors
	(which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of
	these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to
	various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited
	when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the
	private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent
	competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, if we are obligated to pay cash for the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares redeemed
	and, in the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we make purchases of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, potentially reducing the resources available to us for our
	initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business
	combination, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In such case, our public
	shareholders may only receive $10.00 per share, and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public shareholders may receive less than $10.00 per share on the redemption of
	their shares. See "&#151;If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be
	less than $10.00 per share" and other risk factors herein.

	interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such

	any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only

	execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
	agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the

	waived that may be brought against us within the 10&nbsp;years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.00 per

	To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare related companies are generally subject to greater governmental regulation than most other industries at the U.S. state and
	federal levels, and internationally. In recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely
	affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities. In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States
	through the Health Care Reform Act. These laws are intended to increase health insurance coverage through individual and employer mandates, subsidies offered to lower income individuals, tax credits
	available to smaller employers and broadening of Medicaid eligibility. While one intent of healthcare reform is to expand health insurance coverage to more individuals, it may also involve additional
	regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs, including coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services. The Health Care Reform Act has had a significant impact on the
	healthcare sector in the U.S. and consequently has the ability to affect the companies within the healthcare industry. The ultimate effects of federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or
	regulation, or healthcare initiatives, if any, on the healthcare sector, whether implemented at the federal or state level, or internationally, cannot be predicted with certainty and such reform,
	legislation, regulation or initiatives, including the Health Care Reform Act or any successor legislation, may adversely affect the performance of a potential business combination.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
	healthcare related companies depend on the exclusive rights or patents for the products they develop and distribute. Patents have a limited duration and, upon expiration, other
	companies may
	market substantially similar "generic" products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, causing the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the
	price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. The
	profitability of healthcare related companies may also be affected, among other factors, by restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs of medical products
	and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited product offering, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Finally, because

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the involvement of our sponsor, officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses
	affiliated with our sponsor, officers and directors. Our officers and directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under
	"Management&#151;Conflicts of Interest." Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific
	opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no preliminary discussions concerning a business combination
	with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that
	such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination as set forth in "Proposed Business&#151;Effecting Our Initial Business Combination&#151;Selection of a target business
	and structuring of our initial business combination" and such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent
	investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or
	more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our officers, directors or existing holders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business
	combination may not be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2015, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or
	approximately $0.003 per share. In September 2016, our sponsor transferred 471,250 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at their original per share purchase price. As such, our
	initial shareholders will collectively own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after this offering (assuming they do not purchase units in this offering). If we increase or decrease the size of
	the offering, we will effect a capitalization or share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as
	to maintain the ownership of our initial shareholders prior to this offering at 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon the consummation of this offering. The founder shares will be
	worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have committed to purchase an aggregate of 16,000,000 (or 17,800,000 if the underwriters'
	over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement warrants, each exercisable for one-half of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share, for a purchase price of $8,000,000 in the aggregate or
	$8,900,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), or $0.50 per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete a business combination. Two
	private placement warrants may be exercised for one whole Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein.

	We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the

	For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would

	us to complete our initial business combination, because we have not yet identified any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of
	certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply
	with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations
	regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder
	approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth
	company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700&nbsp;million
	as of any June&nbsp;30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our
	securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our
	securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
	Section&nbsp;102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private
	companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply
	with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to
	non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or
	revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or
	revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of
	using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.

	us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial

	shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United
	States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially

	judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be

	These
	expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we
	may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
	combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the
	engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not
	anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for
	any specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account. Based on current interest
	rates, we would expect approximately $60,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over 12&nbsp;months following the investment of such funds in specified
	U.S. Government Treasury bills beginning in January 2017; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current
	yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an
	affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such
	loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
	combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such
	loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement
	warrants issued to our initial shareholders. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
	agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	rules of the NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net proceeds of this offering
	and the sale of the private placement warrants, $300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $10,500,000 (or up to $12,075,000 if the
	underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering, be placed in a non-interest bearing trust account with
	Continental Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company acting as trustee. Beginning in January 2017, the funds in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity
	of 180&nbsp;days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule&nbsp;2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
	Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $60,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year, following the investment
	of such funds in specified U.S. government treasury bills or in specified money market funds beginning in January 2017. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in
	the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement
	warrants will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i)&nbsp;the completion of our initial business combination, (ii)&nbsp;the redemption of any public shares properly
	tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
	public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of this offering and (iii)&nbsp;the redemption of all of our public shares if we are
	unable to complete our initial business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that
	interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial business combination. If our
	initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our
	initial business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
	post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
	capital.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin
	preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
	acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of
	undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
	and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor, members
	of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

	rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of
	our initial business combination. Please see "Proposed Business&#151;Permitted purchases of our securities" for a description of how such persons will determine which shareholders to seek to
	acquire shares from. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection
	with our initial business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any
	such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such
	purchases are prohibited by Regulation&nbsp;M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules
	under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the
	purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of
	our initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent
	to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be
	within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our Board of Directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any share dividends in the
	foreseeable future, except if we increase the size of the offering, in which case we will effect a capitalization or share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism immediately prior to
	the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial shareholders prior to this offering at 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon the
	consummation of this offering. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we
	may agree to in connection therewith.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the public offering price per Class&nbsp;A ordinary share, assuming no value is attributed to the warrants
	included in the units we are offering pursuant to this prospectus or the private placement warrants, and the pro forma net tangible book value per Class&nbsp;A ordinary share after this offering
	constitutes the dilution to investors in this offering. Such calculation does not reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of warrants, including the private placement warrants,
	which would cause the actual dilution to the public shareholders to be higher, particularly where a cashless exercise is utilized. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our net
	tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities (including the value of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares which may be redeemed for cash), by the number of outstanding
	Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
	June&nbsp;30, 2016, our net tangible book value was a deficiency of $503,651, or approximately $(0.07) per Class&nbsp;B ordinary share. After giving effect to the sale of
	30,000,000 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares included in the units we are offering by this prospectus, the sale of the private placement warrants and the deduction of underwriting commissions and
	estimated expenses of this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value at June&nbsp;30, 2016 would have been $5,000,008 or $0.56 per share, representing an immediate increase in net tangible
	book value (as decreased by the value of the approximately 28,558,378 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares that may be redeemed for cash and assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option)
	of $0.63 per share to our initial shareholders as of the date of this prospectus and an immediate dilution of $9.44 per share or 94.4% to our public shareholders not exercising their redemption
	rights. The dilution to new investors if the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full would be an immediate dilution of $9.51 per share or 95.1%.

	price equal to the amount in the trust account as set forth in our tender offer or proxy materials (initially anticipated to be the aggregate amount held in trust two days prior to the commencement of
	our tender offer or shareholders meeting, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares sold in this offering).

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our liquidity needs have been satisfied prior to completion of this offering through receipt of $25,000 from the sale of the founder
	shares to our sponsor and up to $300,000 in loans from our sponsor under an unsecured promissory note. As of June&nbsp;30, 2016, we had borrowed $175,000 under the unsecured promissory note.
	Subsequent to June&nbsp;30, 2016, our sponsor loaned us an additional $125,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. We estimate that the net proceeds from (i)&nbsp;the sale
	of the units in this offering, after deducting offering expenses of approximately $900,000 and underwriting commissions of $6,000,000 ($6,900,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
	exercised in full) (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of $10,500,000 (or up to $12,075,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full)), and (ii)&nbsp;the sale of the
	private placement warrants for a purchase price of $8,000,000 (or $8,900,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be $301,100,000 (or $346,100,000 if the
	underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of this amount, $300,000,000 or $345,000,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, including $10,500,000 (or up to
	$12,750,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) in deferred underwriting commissions) will be deposited into a non- interest bearing trust account. Beginning in January
	2017, the funds in the trust account will be invested only in specified U.S. government treasury bills or in specified money market funds. The remaining $1,100,000 will not be held in the trust
	account. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $900,000 we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to
	be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $900,000, the amount of funds we intend to
	be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior

	identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
	or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, and to pay taxes to

	that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account
	would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the
	private placement warrants issued to our initial shareholders. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to
	such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver

	structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations; $150,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; $75,000 for NASDAQ and other regulatory
	fees; $240,000 for office space, administrative and support services; $50,000 as a reserve for liquidation expenses and approximately $135,000 for general working capital that will be used for
	miscellaneous expenses and reserves net of estimated interest income.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
	amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for
	financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a "no-shop" provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from "shopping"
	around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
	intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a "no-shop"
	provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach
	or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2015, our sponsor purchased 8,625,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003
	per share. The purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. In September&nbsp;2016, our
	sponsor transferred 471,250 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at their original per share purchase price. As such, our initial shareholders will collectively own 20% of our
	issued and outstanding shares after this offering (assuming they do not purchase units in this offering). If we increase or decrease the size of the offering, we will effect a capitalization or share
	repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable with respect to our Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to
	maintain the ownership of founder shares our initial shareholders at 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon the consummation of this offering. Our sponsor does not intend to purchase

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and
	directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business
	combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such
	repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement
	warrants issued to our initial shareholders. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do
	not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
	all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

	founders are two of the founders and managing partners of Avista. Avista is a middle market private equity firm focused on control buyout and growth investments in the healthcare,
	communications and industrial sectors, with offices in New York, Houston and London. Thompson Dean, our Executive Chairman, and David Burgstahler, our President and Chief Executive Officer, were two
	of the founders of Avista in 2005. Our founders have worked together for over 20&nbsp;years. Over the past 10&nbsp;years, Avista has raised four private equity funds (Avista Capital Partners I,
	II, III and IV&nbsp;L.P.) and had approximately $6&nbsp;billion in assets under management as of June&nbsp;30, 2016. We expect that Avista will raise additional funds and / or successor funds in

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
	we may acquire a target business in any industry or location, our initial focus will be to acquire and operate a North American or European healthcare-related business. AHPAC will
	target businesses in the healthcare industry that it considers to have strong management teams, stable cash flows and robust growth prospects. We believe that we derive significant benefit from our
	management team and board members as well as our affiliation with Avista. We believe that the AHPAC team brings a distinctive blend of private equity investing experience, deal sourcing capabilities
	and operating expertise. Our team has extensive experience not only identifying and executing such acquisitions, but also running and operating the businesses post transaction. In addition, the AHPAC
	team has significant experience working with private companies to reshape their operations and help drive value creation. Not all of such companies have achieved the same level of value creation.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	believe that the AHPAC team is well positioned to identify attractive acquisition candidates because of their extensive contacts and transaction sources, including a broad list of
	industry executives, public board members, private owners, wealthy families, private capital managers, private equity funds, investment bankers and other transaction intermediaries. A central
	component of our acquisition strategy is our management team's ability to implement value creation initiatives designed to drive shareholder value as they have done in the past for Avista portfolio
	companies, not all of which have achieved the same level of shareholder value. The AHPAC team blends financial sophistication, operating perspective and business management skills to execute on these

	teams, stable cash flows and robust growth prospects. AHPAC believes that the healthcare industry will experience growth over the foreseeable future as a result of global economic growth and long-term

	healthcare
	industry will continue its strong growth, driven by the continued aging of the global population, increased prevalence of chronic disease states, increased demand for higher standards of
	healthcare, especially in the emerging economies, and new product innovation and investment in research and development. Given these factors, total global healthcare spending is expected to grow by
	5.6% annually over the 2016-2019 period. U.S. healthcare spending, in particular, is projected to increase to approximately 17.2% of gross domestic product and remain the highest proportion globally,
	as a result of expanded coverage driven by the Health Care Reform Act and Medicaid expansion.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the pharmaceutical sector, demographics and disease trends have continued to boost long-term drug consumption globally. In the United States, the expansion of insurance coverage via
	health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion is projected to increase revenues for pharmaceutical companies; however, greater scrutiny of branded drug pricing is likely to persist for the
	foreseeable future. Many national healthcare systems continue to encourage greater use of generic drugs due to ongoing government budgetary pressures, creating significant growth opportunities for
	generic pharmaceutical companies. We believe that fast-growing emerging markets also provide a source of long-term and sustained growth opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry, driven by
	increasing wealth and awareness of health issues in these markets. In order to exploit these growth opportunities, and to drive operating and tax efficiencies, many pharmaceutical companies have
	pursued aggressive acquisition strategies in recent years, and we expect consolidation to remain a core theme in the years to come in the pharmaceutical sector.

	in certain key areas and increased investment into emerging markets and pipelines. We intend to target companies with differentiated technologies and IP positions, strong innovation capabilities,
	exposure to new product cycles, and an increasing emerging market focus. In particular, we believe that the robust industry
	consolidation in recent years will create strong buying opportunities in 2016 and beyond as larger industry players look to rationalize their portfolios.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	pharmaceutical and medical device outsourcing sectors benefit from continued growth in research and development spending and increasing penetration of outsourcing within this sector.
	Pharmaceutical and medical device companies turn to outsourcing to access the greater global infrastructure, enhanced efficiency (in cost and speed) along with the therapeutic expertise that the
	contract research organization brings. We believe that outsourced research spending will continue to grow over the next five years due to the underlying demand.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing

	medical treatments. Average annual growth of out-of-pocket health care expenditure is projected to rise to approximately 5.0% by 2023 from 3.2% in 2013. We believe the trend towards the consumer
	directing more healthcare buying decisions will benefit over-the-counter, dietary supplements, functional foods and other personal care consumer products companies.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	currently do not have any specific business combination under consideration. Our officers and directors have neither individually identified or considered a target business for our
	initial business combination nor have they had any discussions regarding possible target businesses amongst themselves or with our underwriters or other advisors. All of the members of our management
	team are employed by Avista. Avista is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a business combination, but we have not (nor has
	anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction. We have not (nor have any of our agents
	or affiliates) been approached by any candidates (or representative of any candidates) with respect to a possible acquisition transaction with us and we will not consider a business combination with
	any company that has already been identified to Avista as a suitable acquisition candidate for it. Additionally, we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any measure, directly or indirectly,
	to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for us, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any such acquisition candidate.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avista
	manages several investment vehicles, and we expect that Avista will raise additional funds and/or successor funds in the future, which may be during the period in which we are
	seeking our initial business combination. The Avista funds and their portfolio companies may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. In particular, Avista funds currently manage nine portfolio
	companies focused on the healthcare industry. These portfolio companies may be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financing at any time. We may compete with any one or more of them on any
	given acquisition opportunity. However, we do not expect to directly compete with these Avista entities in seeking our initial business combination, primarily due to the anticipated differences in the
	expected size of the equity investment by any such Avista entity in an acquisition and by us in our initial business combination; the later stage of Avista's investment in many of these entities; and
	the public nature of our acquisition strategy. In addition, all of our officers and certain of our directors have fiduciary and contractual duties to Avista. As a result, these officers and directors
	may have a duty to offer acquisition opportunities to certain Avista funds or portfolio companies subject to their fiduciary duties as a matter of Cayman Islands law. If these funds decide to pursue
	any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Avista may be suitable for both us and for a current or future Avista fund or
	portfolio company and may be directed to such fund or portfolio company rather than to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. Neither Avista nor members of our management team who are also
	employed by Avista have any
	obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware solely in their capacities as officers or managing directors of Avista. Avista and/or our
	management, in their capacities as officers or managing directors of Avista or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above,
	current or future Avista investment vehicles, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. Avista will determine which entity will be
	allocated any such business opportunity based on a number of factors, including the size of the target business and potential synergies with existing businesses. We do not expect these duties to
	present a significant conflict of interest with our search for an initial business combination. Avista's traditional private equity activities typically involve investing in private companies, and
	while Avista will often take companies public, it typically invests in those entities several years prior to an initial public offering, not at the time of such offering.

	Initial Business Combination
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an
	aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable
	on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair
	market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect
	to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity
	interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such
	interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination
	if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be
	required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of
	the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to
	the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
	capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders
	immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests
	or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for
	purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target
	businesses.

	Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form&nbsp;15 to suspend our reporting or other
	obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe our management team's significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with
	a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate
	relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team's relationships with
	sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, members of our management team have developed contacts from serving on the Boards of Directors of several companies, including Acino Pharma&nbsp;AG, ACP Mountain Holdings,
	Inc., Alere,&nbsp;Inc., AngioDynamics&nbsp;Inc., Atos Medical AB, Coloplast A/S, ConvaTec Healthcare BS.a.r.l., Fougera Pharmaceuticals&nbsp;Inc., H. Lundbeck A/S, INC Research

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
	at Avista, this network provided our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which were proprietary or where a limited group of investors
	were invited to participate in the sale process. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities.
	In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large
	business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company,
	we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange
	their shares of stock in the target business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there

	believe
	target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering,
	there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
	once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the
	underwriters' ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then
	have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders' interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company's profile among
	potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an
	aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable
	on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our
	Board of Directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to
	independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent
	accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.
	Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to
	effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

	controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity
	interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the
	80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business
	combination.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their
	shares in "street name," to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two
	business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using
	The Depository Trust Company's DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable,
	that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery
	requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the
	business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer
	period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a shareholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10&nbsp;days prior to the shareholder
	vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we
	conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
	is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will
	typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or
	not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such

	proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or
	her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an "option window" after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could

	$1,100,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs
	and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to

	into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the
	trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share
	redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute
	agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they
	will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement,
	breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against
	our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform
	an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party's engagement would
	be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party
	consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management
	is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or
	arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are
	unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be
	required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10&nbsp;years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be
	liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have
	discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i)&nbsp;$10.00 per public share or (ii)&nbsp;such lesser amount per public share held in

	asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to
	take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to
	enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other
	than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to
	monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
	the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $1,100,000 from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, with which to pay any such potential claims (including
	costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In the event that we
	liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by
	creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $900,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of
	funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $900,000, the amount of
	funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.

	claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file&nbsp;a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary
	bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a
	"preferential transfer" or a "fraudulent conveyance." As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having
	breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public

	articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business
	combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC's proxy rules. If, however, we hold a shareholder vote, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy
	rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a shareholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public
	shareholders at least 10&nbsp;days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct
	redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business

	or it elects to remain a shareholder of the company or require the return of his, her or its investment. If the company has not received the notification by the end of the 45th&nbsp;business day, funds and interest or dividends, if any, held in the
	trust or escrow account are automatically returned to the shareholder. Unless a sufficient number of investors elect to remain investors, all funds on deposit in the escrow account must be returned to all of the investors and none of the securities
	are issued.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition
	from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic
	acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these
	competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent
	limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption
	rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by
	certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avista manages several investment vehicles, and we expect that Avista will raise additional funds and/or successor funds in the future,
	which may be during the period in which we are seeking our initial business combination. The Avista funds and their portfolio companies may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. In
	particular, Avista funds currently manage nine portfolio companies focused on the healthcare industry. These portfolio companies may be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financing at any
	time. We may compete with any one or more of them on any given acquisition. However, we do not expect to directly compete with these Avista entities in seeking our initial business combination,
	primarily due to the anticipated differences in the expected size of the equity investment by any such Avista entity in an acquisition and by us in our initial business combination; the later stage of
	Avista's investment in many of these entities; and the public nature of our acquisition strategy. In addition, all of our officers and certain of our directors have fiduciary and contractual duties to
	Avista. As a result, these officers and directors may have a duty to offer acquisition opportunities to certain Avista funds or their portfolio companies subject to their fiduciary duties as a matter
	of Cayman Islands law. If these funds decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Avista may be suitable
	for both us and for a current or future Avista fund or portfolio company and may be directed to such fund or portfolio company rather than to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. Neither Avista
	nor members of our management team who are also employed by Avista have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware solely in
	their capacities as officers or managing directors of Avista. Avista and/or our management, in their capacities as officers or managing directors of Avista or in their other endeavors, may choose to
	present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future Avista investment vehicles, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject
	to applicable fiduciary duties. Avista will determine which entity will be allocated any such business opportunity based on a number of factors, including the size of the target business and potential
	synergies with existing businesses. We do not expect these duties to present a significant conflict of interest with our search for an initial business combination. Avista's traditional private equity
	activities typically involve investing in private companies, and while Avista will often take companies public, it typically invests in those entities several years prior to an initial public
	offering, not at the time of such offering.

	or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable
	for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination
	opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or
	directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.

	connection with a proposed business combination. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time such materials are distributed, because the directors of the post-combination

	such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management's motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have a standing nominating committee, though we intend to form&nbsp;a corporate governance and nominating committee as and
	when required to do so by law or NASDAQ rules. In accordance with Rule&nbsp;5605(e)(2) of the NASDAQ rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by
	the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the
	formation of a standing nominating committee. In accordance with Rule&nbsp;5605(e)(1)(A) of the NASDAQ rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do
	not have a nominating committee charter in place.

	they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at an annual meeting of shareholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of shareholders). Prior to our initial business combination, holders
	of our public shares will not have the right to recommend director candidates for nomination to our board.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company's memorandum and articles of association may provide for
	indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against
	willful default, fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the
	maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We may purchase a policy

	private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share. Two
	private placement warrants may be exercised for one whole Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein. The purchase price of the private

	These additional shares are subject to forfeiture on a pro rata basis with the shares held by our sponsor to the extent the underwriters' over-allotment option is not exercised in full. If, prior to

	full) private placement warrants for a purchase price of $0.50 per warrant in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Of this amount, our sponsor will
	purchase 12,800,000 private placement warrants (or 14,240,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), and each of our independent directors will purchase 800,000 private
	placement warrants (or 890,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). If, prior to our initial business combination, any independent director resigns from our board of
	directors for any reason or is removed from our board of directors for cause, Thompson Dean and David Burgstahler will have the right to repurchase such independent director's private placement
	warrants at their original purchase price. As such, our initial shareholders' interest in this transaction is valued at between $8,000,000 and $8,900,000 in the aggregate, depending on the number of
	private placement warrants purchased. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share. Two private placement warrants may be exercised for
	one whole Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein. The private placement warrants (including the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares issuable
	upon exercise of the private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by it until 30&nbsp;days after the completion of our initial
	business combination.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of June&nbsp;30, 2016, we have
	borrowed $175,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December&nbsp;31, 2016 or the closing of this offering.
	The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the estimated $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust account. The value of our sponsor's interest in this transaction
	corresponds to the principal amount outstanding under any such loan.

	addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and
	directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
	combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such
	repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued
	to the initial holder. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek
	loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek
	access to funds in our trust account.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and one warrant. Each warrant entitles the
	holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at a price of $5.75 per one-half share, or $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. For
	example, if a warrant holder holds two warrants, such warrants will be exercisable for one share of the company's Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares at a price of $11.50 per share. Warrants must be
	exercised for one whole Class&nbsp;A ordinary share. The ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd&nbsp;day following the closing of this offering
	unless Credit Suisse Securities (USA)&nbsp;LLC informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K described below and
	having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue
	to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into Class&nbsp;A ordinary

	their affiliates in privately-negotiated transactions (as described in this prospectus), if any, could result in the approval of our initial business combination even if a majority of our public
	shareholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares, non-votes will have no
	effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. We intend to give approximately 30&nbsp;days (but not less than
	10&nbsp;days nor more than 60&nbsp;days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination.

	shareholder is acting in concert or as a "group" (as defined under Section&nbsp;13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of
	the ordinary shares sold in this offering, which we refer to as the "Excess Shares." However, we would not be restricting our shareholders' ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess
	Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our shareholders' inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our initial business
	combination, and such shareholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such shareholders will not receive redemption
	distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete the business combination. And, as a result, such shareholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to
	dispose such shares would be required to sell their shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.

	warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our shareholders of issuing the maximum number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. If our management
	takes advantage of this option, all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by
	dividing (x)&nbsp;the product of the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the "fair market value" (defined below) over the exercise price of
	the warrants by (y)&nbsp;the fair market value. The "fair market value" shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the
	third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, the notice of redemption will contain the
	information necessary to calculate the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to be received upon exercise of the warrants, including the "fair market value" in such case. Requiring a cashless
	exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. We believe this feature is an attractive option to us if we do not
	need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after our initial business combination. If we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option, our initial
	shareholders and their permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other
	warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, as described in more detail below.

	agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether
	they will be affiliated with us following a business combination. If they remain affiliated with us, their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited. We expect to
	have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our
	securities, an insider cannot trade in our securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public shareholders who could exercise their warrants and
	sell the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares received upon such exercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling
	such securities. As a result, we believe that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate.

	Certain Differences in Corporate Law
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cayman Islands companies are governed by the Companies Law. The Companies Law is modeled on English Law but does not follow recent
	English Law statutory enactments, and differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the provisions
	of the Companies Law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mergers and Similar Arrangements.
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain circumstances, the Companies Law allows for mergers or consolidations between two Cayman
	Islands
	companies, or between a Cayman Islands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction (provided that is facilitated by the laws of that other jurisdiction).
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
	the merger or consolidation is between two Cayman Islands companies, the directors of each company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation containing certain
	prescribed information. That plan or merger or consolidation must then be authorized by either (a)&nbsp;a special resolution (usually a majority of 66
<SUP>
	2
</SUP>
	/
<SMALL>
	3
</SMALL>
	% in value who attend and vote
	at a general meeting) of the shareholders of each company; or (b)&nbsp;such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company's articles of association. A shareholder has
	the right to vote on a merger or consolidation regardless of whether the shares that he holds otherwise give him voting rights. No shareholder resolution is required for a merger between a parent
	company (i.e.,&nbsp;a company that owns at least 90% of the issued shares of each class in a subsidiary company) and its subsidiary company. The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating
	security interest of a constituent company must be obtained, unless the court waives such requirement. If the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies is satisfied that the requirements of the Companies
	Law (which includes certain other formalities) have been complied with, the Registrar of Companies will register the plan of merger or consolidation.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
	the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company, the procedure is similar, save that with respect to the foreign company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted
	company are required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i)&nbsp;that the merger or
	consolidation is permitted or not prohibited by the constitutional documents of the foreign company and by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign company is incorporated, and that those
	laws and any requirements of those constitutional documents have been or will be complied with; (ii)&nbsp;that no petition or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains outstanding or order
	made or resolution adopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign company in any jurisdictions; (iii)&nbsp;that no receiver, trustee, administrator or other similar person has been appointed in any
	jurisdiction and is acting in respect of the foreign company, its affairs or its property or any part thereof; (iv)&nbsp;that no scheme, order, compromise or other similar arrangement has been
	entered into or made in any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company are and continue to be suspended or restricted.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where

	having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i)&nbsp;that the foreign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that the merger or
	consolidated is bona fide and not intended to defraud unsecured creditors of the foreign company; (ii)&nbsp;that in respect of the transfer of any security interest granted by the foreign company to
	the surviving or consolidated company (a)&nbsp;consent or approval to the transfer has been obtained, released or waived; (b)&nbsp;the transfer is permitted by and has been approved in accordance
	with the constitutional documents of the foreign company; and (c)&nbsp;the laws of the jurisdiction of the foreign company with respect to the transfer have been or will be complied with;

	the above procedures are adopted, the Companies Law provides for a right of dissenting shareholders to be paid a payment of the fair value of his shares upon their dissenting to
	the merger or consolidation if they follow a prescribed procedure. In essence, that procedure is as follows (a)&nbsp;the shareholder must give his written objection to the merger or consolidation to
	the constituent company before the vote on the merger or consolidation, including a statement that the shareholder proposes to demand payment for his shares if the merger or consolidation is
	authorized by the vote; (b)&nbsp;within 20&nbsp;days following the date on which the merger or consolidation is approved by the shareholders, the constituent company must give written notice to
	each shareholder who made a written objection; (c)&nbsp;a shareholder must within 20&nbsp;days following receipt of such notice from the constituent company, give the constituent company a written
	notice of his intention to dissent including, among other details, a demand for payment of the fair value of his shares; (d)&nbsp;within seven days following the date of the expiration of the period
	set out in paragraph&nbsp;(b) above or seven days following the date on which the plan of merger or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the constituent company, the surviving company or the
	consolidated company must make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the fair value and if the company and the shareholder
	agree the price within 30&nbsp;days following the date on which the offer was made, the company must pay the shareholder such amount; (e)&nbsp;if the company and the shareholder fail to agree a
	price within such 30&nbsp;day period, within 20&nbsp;days following the date on which such 30&nbsp;day period expires, the company (and any dissenting shareholder) must file&nbsp;a petition
	with the Cayman Islands Grand Court to determine the fair value and such petition must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the dissenting shareholders with whom agreements as to the
	fair value of their shares have not been reached by the company. At the hearing of that petition, the court has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of
	interest, if any, to be paid by the company upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list filed by the company may participate fully in all
	proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of a dissenting shareholder are not be available in certain circumstances, for example, to dissenters holding shares of any
	class in respect of which an open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where the consideration for such shares to be
	contributed are shares of any company listed on a national securities exchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated company.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
	Cayman Islands law also has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances, schemes of arrangement will
	generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies, commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as a "scheme of arrangement" which may be tantamount to a
	merger. In the event that a merger was sought pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the procedure of which are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to
	consummate a merger in the United States), the arrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and
	who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or
	meeting summoned for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting
	shareholder would have the right to express to the court the view that the transaction should not be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Companies Law permits a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands to amend its memorandum and articles of association with the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of such
	company's outstanding ordinary shares. A company's articles of association may specify that the approval of a higher majority is required but, provided the approval of the required majority is
	obtained, any Cayman Islands exempted company may amend its memorandum and articles of association regardless of whether its memorandum and articles of association provides otherwise. Accordingly,
	although we could amend any of the provisions relating to our proposed offering, structure and business plan which are contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we
	view all of these provisions as binding obligations to our shareholders and neither we, nor our officers or directors, will take any action to amend or waive any of these provisions unless we provide
	dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to ownership and disposition of
	our units, Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants, which we refer to collectively as our securities. Because the components of a unit are separable at the option of the holder, the holder of a
	unit generally should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the owner of the underlying Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and warrant components of the unit, as the case may be. As a
	result, the discussion below with respect to actual holders of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants should also apply to holders of units (as the deemed owners of the underlying Class&nbsp;A
	ordinary shares and warrants that comprise the units). This discussion applies only to securities that are held as a capital asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is applicable only to holders
	who purchased units in this offering and assumes any distributions on our ordinary shares will be paid in U.S. dollars.

	regulations as of the date hereof, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this prospectus may affect the tax consequences described herein. This discussion does not address any aspect of

	of one share of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and one warrant to acquire one-half of one of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. We intend to treat the acquisition of a unit in this
	manner and, by purchasing a unit, you will agree to adopt such treatment for tax purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such
	holder for such unit between the one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and the warrant based on the relative fair market value of each at the time of issuance. The price allocated to each Class&nbsp;A
	ordinary share and the warrant should be the shareholder's tax basis in such share or warrant, as the case may be. Any disposition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
	disposition of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and one warrant comprising the unit, and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and
	warrant based on their respective relative fair market values at the time of disposition. The separation of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and the warrant comprising a unit should not be a taxable
	event for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

	authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the characterization described above or the discussion
	below. Accordingly, each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax advisors regarding tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative characterizations of a unit). The
	balance of this discussion assumes that the characterization of the units described above is respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the passive foreign investment company ("PFIC") rules discussed below, a U.S. holder generally will be required to include
	in gross income as dividends the amount of any cash distribution paid on our ordinary shares. A cash distribution on such shares generally will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes to the extent the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Such dividends paid by us will be
	taxable to a corporate U.S. holder at regular rates and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other
	domestic corporations.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions
	in excess of such earnings and profits generally will be applied against and reduce the U.S. holder's basis in its ordinary shares (but not below zero) and, to the extent
	in excess of such basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such ordinary shares.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With

</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
	such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period for the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants so disposed of
	exceeds one year. It is unclear, however, whether the redemption rights with respect to the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares described in this prospectus may suspend the running of the applicable
	holding period for this purpose. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. holders will be eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
	limitations.
</FONT>

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
	the amount of gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder is an amount equal to the difference between (i)&nbsp;the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any
	property received in such disposition (or, if the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants are held as part of units at the time of the
	disposition, the portion of the amount realized on such disposition that is allocated to the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants based upon the then fair market values of the Class&nbsp;A
	ordinary shares and the warrants included in the units) and (ii)&nbsp;the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants so disposed of. A U.S. holder's adjusted
	tax basis in its Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants generally will equal the U.S. holder's acquisition cost (that is, as discussed above, the portion of the purchase price of a unit allocated
	to a share of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrant or, as discussed below, the U.S. holder's initial basis for Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares received upon exercise of warrants) less, in the case

	Redemption of Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares
</I>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, in the event that a U.S. holder's Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares are redeemed pursuant to
	the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under "Description of Securities&#151;Ordinary Shares" or if we purchase a U.S. holder's Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares in an open market
	transaction, the treatment of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as sale of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares under
	Section&nbsp;302 of the Code. If the redemption qualifies as a sale of ordinary shares, the U.S. holder will be treated as described under "U.S. holders&#151;Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable
	Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares and Warrants" above. If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, the U.S. holder will be
	treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences described above under "U.S. holders&#151;Taxation of Distributions." Whether a redemption qualifies for sale treatment
	will depend largely on the total number of our shares treated as held by the U.S. holder (including any shares constructively owned by the U.S. holder as a result of owning warrants) relative to all
	of our shares outstanding both before and after the redemption. The redemption of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares generally will be treated as a sale of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares (rather than
	as a corporate distribution) if the redemption (i)&nbsp;is "substantially disproportionate" with respect to the U.S. holder, (ii)&nbsp;results in a "complete termination" of the U.S. holder's
	interest in us or (iii)&nbsp;is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with respect to the U.S. holder. These tests are explained more fully below.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied, a U.S. holder takes into account not only shares actually owned by the U.S. holder, but also our
	shares that are constructively owned by it. A U.S. holder may constructively own, in addition to shares owned directly, shares owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S.
	holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. holder, as well as any shares the U.S. holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include Class&nbsp;A
	ordinary shares which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants. In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of our outstanding voting shares actually and
	constructively owned by the U.S. holder immediately following the redemption of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares must, among other requirements, be less than 80% of the percentage of our outstanding
	voting shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder immediately before the redemption. Prior to our initial business combination, the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will not be voting
	shares for this purpose and, consequently, this substantially disproportionate test will not be applicable. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. holder's interest if either (i)&nbsp;all of
	our shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder are redeemed or (ii)&nbsp;all of our shares actually owned by the U.S. holder are redeemed and the U.S. holder is eligible to waive,
	and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of shares owned by certain family members and the U.S. holder does not constructively own any other shares. The redemption of
	the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if a U.S. holder's conversion results in a "meaningful reduction" of the U.S. holder's proportionate interest in us.
	Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. holder's proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a
	published ruling
	that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority shareholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a
	"meaningful reduction." A U.S. holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below and except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant, a U.S.
	holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of an ordinary share on the exercise of a warrant for cash. A U.S. holder's tax basis in a Class&nbsp;A ordinary share received
	upon exercise of the warrant generally will be an amount equal to the sum of the U.S. holder's initial investment in the warrant (i.e.,&nbsp;the portion of the U.S. holder's purchase price for a
	unit that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under "&#151;Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit") and the exercise price. The U.S. holder's holding period for
	a Class&nbsp;A ordinary share received upon exercise of the warrant will begin on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly the date of exercise) of the warrants and will not include the
	period during which the U.S. holder held the warrants. If a warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder's tax basis in the
	warrant.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current law. A cashless exercise may not be taxable, either because the exercise is not a realization event
	or because the
	exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In either situation, a U.S. holder's tax basis in the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares received generally will equal the
	U.S. holder's tax basis in the warrant. If the cashless exercise was not a realization event, it is unclear whether a U.S. holder's holding period for the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will commence
	on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the Class&nbsp;A
	ordinary shares will include the holding period of the warrant. It is also possible that a cashless exercise may be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized because a
	U.S. holder may be deemed to have surrendered a portion of its warrants in a taxable transaction to pay the exercise price for the balance of its warrants that are treated as exercised for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes. In such event, a U.S. holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the warrants deemed surrendered and
	the U.S. holder's tax basis in the warrants deemed surrendered. In this case, a U.S. holder's tax basis in the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares received would equal the U.S. holder's tax basis in the
	warrants treated as exercised plus the fair market value of the warrants deemed surrendered. It is unclear whether a U.S. holder's holding period for the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares would commence
	on the date of exercise of the warrants or the day following the date of exercise of the warrants.

	Possible Constructive Distributions
</I>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of ordinary shares for which the warrant may be exercised or to the
	exercise price of the warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this prospectus captioned "Description of Securities&#151;Warrants&#151;Public Shareholders' Warrants." An
	adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. The U.S. holders of the warrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for
	example, the adjustment increases the warrant holders' proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g.,&nbsp;through an increase in the number of ordinary shares that would be
	obtained upon exercise) as a result of a distribution of cash to the holders of our ordinary shares which is taxable to the U.S. holders of such ordinary shares as described under
	"&#151;Taxation of Distributions" above. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. holders of the warrants
	received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest. For certain information reporting purposes, we are required to determine the date and amount of any such
	constructive distributions. Recently proposed Treasury regulations, which we may rely on prior to the issuance of final regulations, specify how the date and amount of constructive distributions are
	determined.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
	we are a blank check company, with no current active business, we believe that it is likely that we will meet the PFIC asset or income test for periods prior to the acquisition
	of a company or assets in a business combination. Pursuant to a start-up exception, however, a corporation will not be a PFIC for the first taxable year the corporation has gross income (the "start-up
	year"), if (1)&nbsp;no predecessor of the corporation was a PFIC; (2)&nbsp;the corporation satisfies the IRS that it will not be a PFIC for either of the first two taxable years following the
	start-up year; and (3)&nbsp;the corporation is not in fact a PFIC for either of those years. It is expected that the net proceeds from this offering will be held in a non-interest bearing trust
	account until January 2017 located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company acting as trustee. If so, we believe that, although subject to uncertainty, the start-up
	year under the start-up exception will be 2017, and we should not be treated as a PFIC for 2016 assuming we qualify for the start-up exception. The applicability of the start-up exception to us will
	not be known until after the close of our current taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 and, perhaps, until after the close of our next taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 2017. After the
	acquisition of a company or assets in a business combination, we may still meet one of the PFIC tests depending on the timing of the acquisition and the amount of our passive income and assets as well
	as the passive income and assets of the acquired business. If the company that we acquire in a business combination is a PFIC, then we will likely not qualify for the start-up exception and will be a
	PFIC for 2016 and for 2017. Our actual PFIC status for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Accordingly,
	there can be no assurance with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 or any future taxable year.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A

	than upon exercise of such warrants), any gain recognized generally will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above, if we
	were a PFIC at any time during the period the U.S. holder held the warrants. If a U.S. holder that exercises such warrants properly makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired ordinary
	shares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to our ordinary shares), the QEF election will apply to the newly acquired ordinary shares, but the adverse tax consequences relating to PFIC
	shares, adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will continue to apply with respect to such newly acquired ordinary shares (which generally will be
	deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC rules that includes the period the U.S. holder held the warrants), unless the U.S. holder makes a purging election under the PFIC rules. The
	purging election creates a deemed sale of such shares at their fair market value. The gain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the
	gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. holder will have a new basis and holding period in the ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder generally makes a QEF election by attaching
	a completed IRS Form&nbsp;8621 (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund), including the information provided in a PFIC annual
	information statement, to a timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the tax year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective
	statement with such return and if certain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of
	a retroactive QEF election under their particular circumstances.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. holder must receive a PFIC annual information statement from us. If we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, we
	will endeavor to provide to a U.S. holder such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual information statement, in order to enable the U.S. holder to make and maintain a QEF
	election, but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of our status as a PFIC in the future

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If

	for our first taxable
	year as a PFIC in which the U.S. holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a purge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election, as described above), any gain recognized on the sale of
	our ordinary shares generally will be taxable as capital gain and no interest charge will be imposed. As discussed above, U.S. holders of a QEF are currently taxed on their pro rata shares of its
	earnings and profits, whether or not distributed. In such case, a subsequent distribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable as a
	dividend to such U.S. holders. The tax basis of a U.S. holder's shares in a QEF will be increased by amounts that are included in income, and decreased by amounts distributed but not taxed as
	dividends, under the above rules. Similar basis adjustments apply to property if by reason of holding such property the U.S. holder is treated under the applicable attribution rules as owning shares

	taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our ordinary shares, however, will not be subject to the PFIC tax and interest charge rules discussed above in respect to
	such shares. In addition, such U.S. holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to such shares for any taxable year of us that ends within or with a taxable year of the U.S.
	holder and in which we are not a PFIC. On the other hand, if the QEF election is not effective for each of our taxable years in which we are a PFIC and the U.S. holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our
	ordinary shares, the PFIC rules discussed above will continue to apply to such shares unless the holder makes a purging election, as described above, and pays the tax and interest charge with respect

	respect to such shares for such taxable year. If the U.S. holder makes a valid mark-to-market election for the first taxable year of the U.S. holder in which the U.S. holder holds (or is deemed to
	hold) ordinary shares in us and for which we are determined to be a PFIC, such holder generally will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above in respect to its ordinary shares. Instead, in
	general, the U.S. holder will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year over the adjusted basis in its
	ordinary shares. The U.S. holder also will be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of its ordinary shares over the fair market value of its ordinary
	shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. holder's basis in its ordinary
	shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of the ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income.
	Currently, a mark-to-market election may not be made with respect to warrants.

	to report a transfer of property (including cash) to us. Substantial penalties may be imposed on a U.S. holder that fails to comply with this reporting requirement. Furthermore, certain U.S. holders

	required to report specified foreign financial assets and fail to do so may be subject to substantial penalties. Potential Investors are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the
	foreign financial asset reporting obligations and their application to an investment in Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants. Each U.S. holder is urged to consult with its own tax advisor

	public offering price were the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies, prior offerings of those companies, our management, our capital
	structure, and currently prevailing general conditions in equity securities markets, including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company. We cannot
	assure you, however, that the price at which the units, Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering
	price or that an active trading market in our units, Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants will develop and continue after this offering.

	Over-allotment involves sales by the underwriters of units in excess of the number of units the underwriters are obligated to
	purchase, which creates a syndicate short position. The short position may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of units over-allotted
	by the underwriters is not greater than the number of units that they may purchase in the over-allotment option. In a naked short position, the number of units involved is greater than the number of
	units in the over-allotment option. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their over-allotment option and/or purchasing units in the open market.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the units in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order
	to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of units to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of units available for purchase in
	the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase units through the over-allotment option. If the underwriters sell more units than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a
	naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying units in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there could be
	downward pressure on the price of the units in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp. (the "Company") as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, and the related statements of operations,
	changes in shareholder's equity and cash flows for the period from December&nbsp;4, 2015 (inception) through
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
	control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
	not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
	on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
	evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp., as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from December&nbsp;4, 2015 (inception) through December&nbsp;31, 2015 in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note&nbsp;1 to the financial statements, the Company has
	no present revenue, its business plan is dependent on the completion of a financing and the Company's cash and working capital as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 are not sufficient to complete its planned
	activities for the upcoming year. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding these matters are also described in
	Notes&nbsp;1 and 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	government treasury obligations, until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the consummation of the Business Combination and (ii)&nbsp;the Company's failure to consummate a Business Combination within the

	prospective target businesses or other entities it engages execute agreements with the Company waiving any claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, there is no guarantee that
	such persons will execute such agreements. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company under certain circumstances if and to the extent any claims by such persons reduce the amount of
	funds in the Trust Account below a specified threshold. The Company has not independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believes that the
	Sponsor's only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations should they arise. The remaining net proceeds (not held in the Trust

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2016, the Company had $106,062 in cash and working capital deficit of $503,651. Further, the Company expects to
	continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management
	plans to address this uncertainty through a Proposed Public Offering as discussed in Note&nbsp;3. There is no assurance that the Company's plans to raise capital or to consummate a Business
	Combination will be successful or successful within the target business acquisition period. The Sponsor has agreed to loan the Company up to $300,000 to be used, in part, for transaction costs
	incurred in connection with the Proposed Public Offering. As of June&nbsp;30, 2016, the Company had borrowed $175,000 under such loan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
	might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities for resale. In addition, the holders have certain "piggy-back"
	registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the Business Combination. However, the registration rights agreement will provide that the Company will not permit any
	registration statement to become effective until termination of applicable lock-up periods with respect to such securities.

	share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction after the Business Combination that results in all of the Public Shareholders having the right to exchange their Class&nbsp;A Shares for
	cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale price of the Class&nbsp;A Shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company's memorandum and articles of association may provide for
	indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against
	willful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide for indemnification of our
	officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful
	neglect. We may purchase a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some
	circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.

	Underwriters
</U>
	&#148;), for whom you (the &#147;
<U>
	Representative
</U>
	&#148;) are acting as representative, to issue and sell&nbsp;to the several Underwriters 30,000,000 units of the Company (said units to be issued and sold by the Company being hereinafter called the &#147;
<U>
	Firm Securities
</U>
	&#148;) and also proposes to issue and sell to the Underwriters, at the option of the Underwriters, an aggregate of not more than 4,500,000 additional units of the Company to cover over-allotments (the &#147;
<U>
	Optional Securities
</U>
	&#148;) as set forth below. The Firm Securities and the Optional Securities are herein collectively called the &#147;
<U>
	Offered Securities
</U>
	&#148;.&#160; To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule I other than you, the term Representative as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriter, and the term Underwriter shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires. Certain capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined are defined in Section&nbsp;18 hereof.

	Each unit (the &#147;

	Warrant(s
</U>
	)&#148;). The Ordinary Shares and Warrants included in the Units will not trade separately until the 52nd day following the date of the Prospectus (unless the Representative informs the Company of its decision to allow earlier separate trading), subject to (a)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s preparation of an audited balance sheet reflecting the receipt by the Company of the proceeds of the Offering (as defined below), (b)&nbsp;the filing of such audited balance sheet with the Commission on a Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K or similar form by the Company that includes such audited balance sheet, and (c)&nbsp;the Company having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Each Warrant entitles its holder, upon exercise, to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share for $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per whole share) during the period commencing on the later of thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the completion of the Company&#146;s initial Business Combination (as defined below) or twelve (12)&nbsp;months from the date of the consummation of the Offering and terminating on the five-year anniversary of the date of the completion of such initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption;

	Business Combination
</U>
	&#148; (as described more fully in the Registration Statement) shall mean a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses involving the Company.

In the event that the Company does not effect a Business Combination by twenty-four (24)&nbsp;months from the closing of the Offering, the Company will (i)&nbsp;cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii)&nbsp;as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10)&nbsp;business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $50,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders&#146; rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and subject to the requirement that any refund of income taxes that were paid from the Trust Account that is received after the redemption shall be distributed to the former Public Shareholders, and (iii)&nbsp;as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company&#146;s remaining shareholders and the Company&#146;s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company&#146;s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Only Public Shareholders holding Ordinary Shares included in the Offered Securities shall be entitled to receive such redemption amounts and the Company shall pay no such redemption amounts or any distributions in liquidation with respect to any other ordinary shares of the Company. The Company will not propose any amendment to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association that would affect the substance or timing of the Company&#146;s obligation to redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares if the Company has not consummated a Business Combination within twenty-four (24)&nbsp;months from the closing of the Offering, as described in Article&nbsp;49.4(a)&nbsp;of the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association unless the Company offers to the Public Shareholders the right to redeem their Public Shares in connection with such amendment.

	Under Cayman Islands law, the register of members (shareholders) is
<I>
	prima facie
</I>
	evidence of title to shares and this register would not record a third party interest in such shares. However, there are certain limited circumstances where an application may be made to a Cayman Islands court for a determination on whether the register of members reflects the correct legal position. Further, the Cayman Islands court has the power to order that the register of members maintained by a company should be rectified where it considers that the register of members does not reflect the correct legal position. As far as we are aware, such applications are rarely made in the Cayman Islands, but if such an application were made in respect of the Company&#146;s Ordinary Shares, then the validity of such shares may be subject to re-examination by a Cayman Islands court.
