	Even if one or more of the drug product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate
	incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved drug product candidate. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, European Medicines Agency, or
	EMA, or other applicable regulatory agencies, to change our manufacturing processes or assays, or to perform clinical, pre-clinical, or other types of studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. If we are successful in obtaining
	regulatory approvals to market one or more of our drug product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the drug product, the
	ability to get coverage and adequate reimbursement, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory
	authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, even if approved.
	If we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved drug products, we may never become profitable.

	be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our drug product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or

	In addition, our

	some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Because the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical
	trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites. Moreover, because our drug product candidates represent a
	departure from more commonly used methods for ischemic HF and cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, rather than enroll patients in our clinical trials.

	Even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect

	Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical
	trial process. Although drug product candidates may demonstrate promising results in early clinical (human) trials and pre-clinical (animal) studies, they may not prove to be effective in subsequent clinical trials. For example, testing on animals
	may occur under different conditions than testing in humans and therefore the results of animal studies may not accurately predict human experience. Likewise, early clinical trials may not be predictive of eventual safety or effectiveness results in
	larger-scale pivotal clinical trials. The results of pre-clinical studies and previous clinical trials as well as data from any interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials of our drug product candidates, as well as studies and trials of other
	products with similar mechanisms of action to our drug product candidates, may not be predictive of the results of ongoing or future clinical trials. For example, the positive results generated in our Phase 2 clinical trial of C-Cure for the
	treatment of patients with ischemic HF do not ensure that our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of C-Cure for the treatment of patients with ischemic HF in Europe and Israel, or CHART-1, or CHART-2, which we expect to initiate end of Q2 2016, will
	demonstrate similar results or observations. Drug product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and earlier clinical trials. In
	addition to the safety and efficacy traits of any drug product candidate, clinical trial failures may result from a multitude of factors including flaws in trial design, dose selection, placebo effect and patient enrollment criteria. A number of
	companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials, and it is possible that we will as well.
	Based upon negative or inconclusive results, we or our collaborators may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or pre-clinical studies. In addition, data obtained from trials and studies are susceptible to
	varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.

	We may seek a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for some of our drug product candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a product that is intended, alone
	or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or
	more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drug product candidates that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and
	the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drug product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA

	product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of

	of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a
	life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the product.

	Generally, if a drug
	product candidate with an Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the
	FDA from approving another marketing application for the same product and indication for that time period, except in limited circumstances. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity
	period can be reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for Orphan Drug Designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different products
	can be approved for the same condition or the same products can be approved for different conditions. If one of our drug product candidates that receives an orphan drug designation is approved for a particular indication or use within the rare
	disease, the FDA may later approve the same product for additional indications or uses within that rare disease that are not protected by our exclusive approval. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same
	product for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive
	orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Moreover, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the
	request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition or if another product with the same active moiety is
	determined to be safer, more effective, or represents a major contribution to patient care. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a product nor gives the product any advantage in the regulatory
	review or approval process. While we intend to seek Orphan Drug Designation for some of our drug product candidates, we may never receive such designations. Even if we do receive such designations, there is no guarantee that we will enjoy the
	benefits of those designations.

	In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and

	Third-party payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or private, are developing increasingly
	sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our
	products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to
	potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected,
	increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations,
	subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government&#146;s comparative effectiveness research. We cannot predict the full impact of the
	ACA on bio-pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of additional detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet completely occurred. Further, new litigation is currently pending
	before the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to invalidate certain provisions of the ACA.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted
	in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a
	targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate
	reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act
	of 2012, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover
	overpayments to providers from three to five years.

	There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign,
	federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government,
	insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect:

	Our drug product

	back into a patient&#146;s body. As a result of the complexities, the cost to manufacture our drug product candidates, is higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the manufacturing process is less reliable and is more difficult
	to reproduce. Our manufacturing process is susceptible to product loss or failure due to logistical issues associated with the collection of blood cells, or starting material, from the patient, shipping such material to the manufacturing site,

	manufacturing facilities in which our drug product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Because our drug product candidates are
	manufactured for each particular patient, we are required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to materials as they move from the patient to the manufacturing facility, through the manufacturing process, and back to the patient. Maintaining
	such a chain of identity is difficult and complex, and failure to do so could result in adverse patient outcomes, loss of product, or regulatory action including withdrawal of our products from the market. Further, as drug product candidates are
	developed through pre-clinical to late stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize
	processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our drug product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of ongoing clinical trials or

	We manufactured C-Cure for CHART-1 in our pilot manufacturing plant in Belgium and we plan to initially manufacture C-Cure

	1 clinical trial of NKR-2 are being manufacturing at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute&#146;s cell manufacturing facility. In the future, we plan to operate two commercial manufacturing sites, one in the United States and one in the European Union.
	We believe this will allow increased flexibility and reduced logistical costs and will allow for the necessary redundancy in case of site or geography-related failure. However, we are very early in the process of locating sites for these commercial

	Although we are working, or will be

	In addition, the manufacturing process that we develop for our drug product candidates is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval process,
	and we will need to make sure that we or our contract manufacturers, or CMOs, if any, are able to meet all FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. If we or our CMOs are unable to reliably produce drug product
	candidates to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we need to commercialize such drug product candidates. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug product
	candidates, there is no assurance that either we or our CMOs will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements

	Even if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a drug product candidate faster than our competitors, we may face

	differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency of the product. To meet the higher standard of &#147;interchangeability,&#148; an applicant must provide sufficient information to show
	biosimilarity and demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administrated more than once to an individual, the risk in

	A reference biological product is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application

	We and our CROs are required to comply with the GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and
	reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. The FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory
	authorities, enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our future clinical trials may be
	deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA, or other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials did not
	comply with GCPs. In addition, our future clinical trials will require a sufficient number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our drug product candidates. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or

	CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or
	regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our drug product candidates. If any such event

	If any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on

	which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that

	applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing their products to avoid being covered by our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications we hold with respect
	to our drug product candidates is threatened, this could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and could threaten our ability to commercialize, our drug product candidates. Further, because patent applications in the United
	States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our drug product candidates. Furthermore, for U.S. applications in which all
	claims are entitled to a priority date before March&nbsp;16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims
	of our applications. For U.S. applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March&nbsp;16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law in view of the passage of the America Invents Act, which brought into effect
	significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, including new procedures for challenging pending patent applications and issued patents.

	Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in
	foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology
	products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. For example, an April 2014 report from the Office of the United States Trade
	Representative identified a number of countries, including India and China, where challenges to the procurement and enforcement of patent rights have been reported. Several countries, including India and China, have been listed in the report every
	year since 1989. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or
	interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be
	commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.

	Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To cease such infringement or unauthorized use, we may be

	If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our drug product candidates, the
	defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our drug product candidate is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are
	numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such
	mechanisms include re-examination, inter partes review, post-grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, such as opposition or derivation proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in
	such a way that they no longer cover and protect our drug product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity of our patents, for example, we cannot be certain
	that there is no invalidating prior art of which we, our patent counsel, and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part,
	and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our drug product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.

	As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and

	legislation. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March&nbsp;16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a &#145;&#145;first-to-file&#146;&#146; system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent
	applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made

	proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even
	though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been

	curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and
	cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our

	environmental, competition, and patient privacy and other privacy laws and regulations. Such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, and monetary and injunctive penalties, and could adversely impact our ability to

	official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system

	FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, contractors, consultants or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and
	regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities,
	requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability

	As a U.S. public company, we operate in an
	increasingly demanding regulatory environment that requires us to comply with, among things, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as from 31&nbsp;December 2016, and related rules and regulations of the SEC&#146;s substantial disclosure requirements,
	accelerated reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and
	procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	have limited accounting personnel and other resources to address our internal controls and procedures. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial reporting. However, in
	connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or
	combination of deficiencies, such that there is reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our employees. The material
	weakness identified is related to a lack of segregation of duties given the size of our finance and accounting team.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31 2014, we
	reported three material weaknesses (reference is made to the F-1 prospectus filed in June 2015). Since then, we have taken several remedial actions to address these material weaknesses. In particular, we have hired in 2015 additional staff for the
	finance and legal departments, including a corporate controller and legal advisor. Also, the Group is working with an independent firm to better define, formalize and upgrade (when the case may be) our internal controls and processes with the goal
	of being compliant with the SOX regulation by end of 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of these actions, two out of three material weaknesses identified in the F-1
	registration document are no longer valid. The lack of accounting resources to fulfill the reporting requirements of IFRS and the lack of comprehensive knowledge of IFRS accounting policies are no longer identified as material weaknesses as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, we believe it is possible that if we had performed a formal assessment of our internal control over financial
	reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm had performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, other material weaknesses may have been identified. Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or
	Section&nbsp;404, requires that we include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 20-F beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016. However, until
	we cease to be an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; as that term is defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to and report on the
	effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This may increase the risk that deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will go undetected and may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to
	evaluate our company.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if our management
	concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal
	controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, after we become a public company, our reporting obligations may place a
	significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation.

	During the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements
	of Section&nbsp;404, we may identify other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified,
	supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section&nbsp;404. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective
	internal control environment, we could experience material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
	information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose
	us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from The NASDAQ Global Market, or NASDAQ, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial

	clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data

	While we currently qualify as a foreign private issuer, the determination of foreign private issuer status is
	made annually on the last business day of an issuer&#146;s most recently completed second fiscal quarter and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to us on June&nbsp;30, 2016. In the future, we would lose our foreign private
	issuer status if we to fail to meet the requirements necessary to maintain our foreign private issuer status as of the relevant determination date. For example, if more than 50% of our securities are held by U.S. residents and more than 50% of the
	members of our executive management team or members of our board of directors are residents or citizens of the United States, we could lose our foreign private issuer status.

	available to a foreign private issuer. We would be required under current SEC rules to prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, rather than IFRS, and modify certain of our
	policies to comply with corporate governance practices associated with U.S. domestic issuers. Such conversion of our financial statements to U.S. GAAP will involve significant time and cost. In addition, we may lose our ability to rely upon

	We are a leader in engineered cell therapy
	treatments with clinical programs initially targeting indications in cardiovascular disease and oncology. Our lead drug product candidate in cardiovascular disease is C-Cure, an autologous cell therapy for the treatment of patients with ischemic
	heart failure, or HF. We completed enrollment and dosing of patients in our first Phase 3 clinical trial of C-Cure in Europe and Israel, or CHART-1, respectively in March and June 2015. On March&nbsp;30, 2015, we announced that the Data Safety
	Monitoring Board, or DSMB, reviewed unblinded safety and efficacy data from CHART-1 and determined that such unblinded safety and efficacy data did not support the discontinuation of the trial on the basis of safety or futility. These observations
	suggested that the trial should be continued in its current form. The full data readout from this trial is expected in the middle of 2016. We anticipate initiating our second Phase 3 clinical trial of C-Cure in the United States and Europe, or
	CHART-2, in June 2016, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, lifted the clinical hold that was on CHART-2 in December 2015. Our lead drug product candidate in oncology is NKR-2, an autologous chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, an
	artificial, lab engineered receptor, which is used to graft a given protein onto an immune cell, T lymphocyte, or NKR-T cell, therapy. We are currently enrolling patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, or multiple
	myeloma, or MM, in a Phase 1 clinical trial of NKR-2 in the United States. The first patient in the first cohort was treated in this trial in April 2015 and no treatment-related safety concerns were reported during the 30-day follow-up period for
	this patient or the other two patients treated in the first cohort. The first patient in the second cohort was treated in this trial in December 2015. The safety outcome of the second cohort was disclosed on February&nbsp;24, 2016 and no
	treatment-related safety concerns were reported during the 21-day follow-up period. Interim data from this trial is expected to be reported at various times during the trial, with the full data readout of the first 12 patients and 4 doses expected
	in the middle of 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	All of our current drug product candidates are autologous cell therapy treatments. In autologous procedures, a patient&#146;s
	cells are harvested, selected, reprogrammed and expanded, and then infused back into the same patient. A benefit of autologous therapies is that autologous cells are not recognized as foreign by patients&#146; immune systems. We believe that we are
	well situated to effectively advance autologous cell therapy treatments for cancer and other indications as a result of the expertise and know-how that we have acquired through our development of C-Cure. We also believe that there are numerous
	operational synergies between our product platforms, including that, prior to commercialization, our existing pilot manufacturing plant can accommodate both of our cell therapy programs without significant capital expenditure.

	HF is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body&#146;s metabolic needs, affects 1% to 2% of the adult population in
	developed countries and approximately 5.7&nbsp;million patients were diagnosed with HF in the United States in 2012, according to the American Heart Association. The long-term prognosis associated with HF is dire, with approximately 50% mortality at
	five years following initial diagnosis, according to a report from the American Heart Association. Although existing therapies have been somewhat effective in the treatment of HF, there is still great unmet medical need. In particular, in the case
	of ischemic HF, which is caused by insufficient oxygen to the heart, current treatments fail to address the decrease in the number of functional myocytes, or heart cells, in the heart that result from this lack of oxygen. Over time this functional
	decrease modifies the dynamics of cardiac contractions leading to tissue remodeling and loss of cardiac function. We believe that cellular therapies have the potential to repair or replace the non-functioning myocytes of ischemic HF patients.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To guide cardiac tissue formation, our C-Cure therapy reprograms multipotent stem cells harvested from a patient into cardiopoietic cells, cells that can
	become myocytes, using naturally occurring cytokines, small proteins that play an important role in cell signaling, and growth factors that mimic the signaling that occurs in embryonic heart tissue development. Based on pre-clinical studies, we have
	identified both direct and indirect possible modes of action for C-Cure. The direct mode may replace non-functioning myocytes.

	In the indirect modes, factors secreted by the cardiopoietic cells may cause patients&#146; resident stem cells
	to begin pooling, regenerating and differentiating into cardiac cells, with the resulting favorable environment inducing the non-functioning myocytes to regain function. We have developed C-Cure predominantly on technology that we licensed from the
	Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, or the Mayo Clinic. To assist in the reinjection of cardiopoietic cells, we have also developed C-Cath

	Positive outcomes were
	observed in ischemic HF patients treated with C-Cure in our Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe. Patients treated with C-Cure showed a 25% relative improvement of median left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, which is the percentage of blood that
	is pumped out of the heart at each beat, at six months versus baseline, whereas untreated patients showed a relative improvement of 0.7% versus baseline. Patients treated with C-Cure also demonstrated an improved exercise capacity as measured by the
	six minutes walking distance test, or six minutes WDT, which measures the distance a patient can walk in a six-minute period. The C-Cure treatment group&#146;s walking distance improved by 77 meters compared to the control group.

	Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States after cardiovascular diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
	Prevention. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2014, there were an estimated 1.6&nbsp;million new cancer cases diagnosed and over 550,000 cancer deaths in the United States alone. In the past decades, the cornerstones of cancer therapies
	have been surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Since 2001, small molecules that specifically target cancer cells have emerged as standard treatments for a number of cancers. For example, Gleevec is marketed by Novartis AG for the treatment
	of leukemia, and Herceptin is marketed by Genentech, Inc. for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer. Although these targeted therapies have significantly improved the outcomes for certain patients with these cancers, there is still a high unmet
	need for the treatment of these and many other cancers.

	While the immune system has a natural response to cancer, automatically recognizing and
	eliminating cancer cells, cancer cells can develop the ability to evade immune response, resulting in the formation of potentially dangerous cancerous tumors and blood cancers. CAR T-cell therapy is a new technology that broadly involves engineering
	patients&#146; own T-cells to express CARs so that these re-engineered cells recognize and kill cancer cells, overcoming cancer cells&#146; ability to evade immune response. According to a January 2015 review article published in Immunological
	Reviews, several early clinical trials involving CAR T-cell therapies have suggested potentially high clinical responses in difficult to treat relapsed or refractory B lymphocyte, or B-cell, malignancies. For example, results of a clinical trial
	reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 2014 demonstrated that CAR T-cell therapy that targets the CD19 antigen, or CD19 CAR Therapy, was effective in treating patients with relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
	Treatment was associated with a complete remission rate of 90% and sustained remissions of up to two years after treatment.

	molecules. Accordingly, our technology has the potential to attack and kill a broad range of solid and blood cancers, while CD19 CAR Therapy is typically only effective in B-cell malignancies. In pre-clinical studies, treatment with NKR-2
	significantly increased survival. In some studies, 100% of treated mice survived through the follow-up period of the applicable study, which in one study was 325 days. All untreated mice died during the follow-up period of the applicable study. We
	obtained access to our NKR-T cell drug product candidates and related technology, including technology licensed from the Trustees of Dartmouth College, or Dartmouth College, in January 2015, through our purchase of OnCyte, LLC, a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of Celdara Medical, LLC, or Celdara, a privately-held U.S. biotechnology company.

	HF affects 1% to 2% of the adult population in developed countries and approximately 5.7&nbsp;million patients were diagnosed with HF in the United States in
	2012, according to the American Heart Association. HF can either be of ischemic origin, linked to impairment of blood flow to the heart muscle, or non-ischemic origin, linked to other causes such as hypertension and metabolic disorders. In the
	Bromley heart failure study, 52% of the patients had HF of ischemic origin. Other studies have reported lower rates of ischemic HF, but such differences can be explained by differences in study population, definitions and timing of when the study
	was completed. The prevalence of HF is increasing due to an aging population and the increasing prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity and diabetes. Population studies published in Nature Reviews Cardiology have estimated
	that one in five people over the age of 40 will develop HF during his or her lifetime. The long-term prognosis associated with heart failure is dire, with approximately 50% mortality at five years following initial diagnosis, according to a 2014

	Although existing therapies have been somewhat effective in the treatment of HF,
	there is still great unmet medical need. In particular, in the case of ischemic HF, which is caused by insufficient oxygen to the heart, current treatments fail to address the decrease in the number of functional myocytes in the heart that result
	from this lack of oxygen. Over time this functional decrease modifies the dynamics of cardiac contractions leading to tissue remodeling and loss of cardiac function. We believe that cellular therapies have the potential to repair or replace the
	non-functioning myocytes of ischemic HF patients.

	Our Approach
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead drug product candidate, C-Cure, is an autologous cell therapy that we believe has the potential to treat patients with NYHA Classes II, III and IV
	ischemic HF through both direct and indirect modes of action. The direct mode may replace non-functioning myocytes. In the indirect modes, factors secreted by the cardiopoietic cells may cause patients&#146; resident stem cells to begin pooling,
	regenerating and differentiating into cardiac cells, with the resulting favorable environment inducing the non-functioning myocytes to regain function. We have developed C-Cure based predominantly on technology that we licensed from the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since the heart does not harbor large quantities of stem cells, it cannot rely on self-repair mechanisms to address damage to the myocardium.
	Accordingly, in order to repair or replace non-functioning myocytes, the introduction of cardiopoietic cells is necessary. To guide cardiac tissue formation, our C-Cure therapy reprograms multipotent stem cells harvested from a patient into
	cardiopoietic cells using naturally occurring cytokines and growth factors that mimic the signaling that occurs in embryonic heart tissue development. In the C-Cure process, stem cells are collected from an ischemic HF patient through bone marrow
	aspiration during an outpatient procedure. The stem cells are then harvested, selected, expanded and differentiated into cardiopoietic cells at our manufacturing facility, yielding a homogeneous and pure cardiopoietic cell population. The
	cardiopoietic cells are then re-injected into the heart of the ischemic HF patient with our C-Cath

	A result is considered to be statistically significant when the
	probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for measuring the statistical significance of a result is known as the &#147;p-value&#148;, which
	represents the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% or less probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). A p-value
	= 0.05 is a commonly used criterion for statistical significance, and may be supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities. However, regulatory authorities, including the FDA and EMA, do not rely on strict statistical significance
	thresholds as criteria for market approval and maintain the flexibility to evaluate the overall risks and benefits of a treatment. Accordingly, treatments may receive market approval from the FDA or EMA even if the p-value of the primary endpoint is

	vasculature. Tumor vessels express ligands for the NKG2D receptor that are not generally expressed by normal vessels. We believe that this expression may be linked to genotoxic stress, hypoxia and reoxygenation in tumors and therefore that NKR-2
	could potentially inhibit tumor growth by decreasing tumor vasculature, which could possibly render it effective in the treatment of NKG2D-negative tumors.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pre-clinical studies also demonstrate that NKR-2 is effective without lymphodepletion conditioning, which is the destruction of lymphocytes and T-cells,
	normally by radiation. We believe this absence of a pre-conditioning regimen may expand the range of patients eligible for CAR T-cell treatment, reduce costs, reduce toxicity and thereby improve patient experience and acceptance.

	No significant toxicology findings were reported from pre-clinical multiple-dose studies at dose levels below 10,000,000 NKR-2&nbsp;per animal. Some temporary
	weight loss was noted in animals treated with NKR-2. At this dose, histology showed there was no accumulation of infused cells in any organ other than the lungs. We believe that this accumulation of infused cells in the lungs was likely due to the
	large number of cells infused into the animals.

	On June&nbsp;9 2014, Celdara filed an IND with the FDA (NCT02203825) related to the NKR-2 trial. The subject of the IND is evaluating the safety and
	feasibility of administering a single intravenous dose of NKR-2 to patients with AML, Myelodysplastic Syndrome and MM.

	We are currently enrolling
	patients with (i)&nbsp;AML who are not in remission and for which standard therapy options are not available or (ii)&nbsp;relapsed or refractory progressive MM, in a Phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of single-dose
	intravenous administration of NKR-2 T-cells without prior lymphodepletion conditioning. This is a dose escalation trial to test four different dose levels. Patients may receive doses anywhere from 1,000,000 up to 30,000,000 NKR-2 T-cells in a single
	intravenous injection. For each dose level, three patients, one with AML, one with MM, and one with either AML or MM, will be recruited, until a toxicological response is demonstrated or we reach a dose of 30,000,000 cells. Once a dose has been
	selected, an additional 12 patients, six AML patients and six MM patients, will be included in the dose expansion part of the trial, to probe efficacy signals. This trial is being conducted at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in the United States.
	Interim data is expected to be reported throughout this trial, with the full data readout expected in the middle of 2016. The first patient in the first cohort was treated in this trial in April 2015 and no treatment-related safety concerns were
	reported during the 30-day follow-up period for this patient or the other two patients treated in the first cohort. The safety outcome of the second cohort was disclosed in February 2016 and no treatment-related safety concerns were reported during

	Autologous CAR T-cells must be manufactured for each individual patient. As a result this form of treatment presents cost and logistical challenges.
	We have technology that we believe may enable the development of an allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy, where T-cells harvested from one patient, the donor, are engineered into CAR T-cells that can be used in the treatment of other patients, the host,
	without triggering an immune response. Functioning T-cell receptors on a donor T-cell are responsible for eliciting an adverse immune reaction in the host, which is known as a graft-versus-host response. The goal of our allogeneic platform is to
	eliminate the graft-versus host response. Our allogeneic platform is based on the engineering of T-cells that lack expression of a functional T-cell receptor, while at the same time expressing a CAR that can trigger the killing of cancer cells. We
	believe that our allogeneic platform may allow us to manufacture an off the shelf CAR T-cell therapy product, which has the potential to transform the treatment of cancer.

	We also have two

	on many types of cancer cells, including lymphoma, leukemia and gastrointestional stromal tumors. The primary ligand of NKp30 is B7H6. Previous pre-clinical studies performed at Dartmouth College and reported in the Journal of Immunology in 2012
	demonstrated that NKR-T cells expressing NKp30 were able to kill cancer cells expressing NKp30 ligands both in vitro and in vivo. The second program involves the specific targeting of B7H6 to kill cancer cells that express B7H6. Previous
	pre-clinical studies performed at Dartmouth College and reported in the Journal of Immunology in 2015 demonstrated that therapy targeting B7H6 decreased tumor burden of melanoma- and ovarian cancer-bearing mice.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In consideration for the rights granted to us under the Mayo License, we were required to pay an upfront fee
	to Mayo Clinic of &#128;9,500,000 upon the initial agreement and $3,193,125 upon the execution of the second amendment, which were subsequently converted into our share capital. We also paid the Mayo Clinic $337,000 for the purchase of equipment for
	research purposes. Additionally, we are required to pay to the Mayo Clinic a low single-digit royalty on net commercial sales by us or by our permitted sublicensees from the commercialization of licensed products, on a licensed product-by-licensed
	product basis, beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of the relevant licensed product and extending until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the 15 year anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product, (ii)&nbsp;the date on which

	Under the Mayo License, we are responsible for the
	development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed inventions. We committed to provide the Mayo Clinic with $500,000 of directed research funding per year for the years 2012 through 2014. Any results of this research will automatically
	be included as licensed inventions under the Mayo License. We will also fund research at the Mayo Clinic in the amount of $1,000,000 per year for four years in the area of regeneration or protection for cardiovascular applications. Such payments
	will begin once we have achieved both commercial sale of a licensed product and a positive cash flow from operations in the previous financial year. We will have an exclusive right of first negotiation to acquire an exclusive license to inventions
	that are the direct result of work carried out under these grants, in accordance with the mechanism described in the Mayo License. The Mayo Clinic provided us with directed research and conducted a dose finding study for us at no additional cost.
	Subject to pre-existing obligations, until October&nbsp;18, 2015, we also have an exclusive right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license from the Mayo Clinic on any guided cardiopoiesis technology developed by Dr.&nbsp;Andre Terzic or
	developed or co-developed by Dr.&nbsp;Atta Behfar, the senior investigator involved in the discovery of the cardiopoiesis technology. With respect to both of the foregoing rights of first negotiation, if we and the Mayo Clinic do not reach agreement

	Dartmouth College may, at its option, terminate the license, upon thirty days written notice, if we fail to pay at least the minimum royalty payment amount or

	days&#146; prior written notice and opportunity to cure. We may unilaterally terminate the agreement by giving three months advance written notice to Dartmouth College and paying a termination fee of $2,500. Either party may terminate the agreement
	in the event the other party defaults or breaches any of the provisions of the agreement, subject to 30 days&#146; prior notice and opportunity to cure. In addition, the agreement automatically terminates in the event we become insolvent, make an

	competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites

	One of our drug product candidates is a combination product that is
	comprised of a biologic and a device (an endocardial injection catheter) that is used for delivery of the biologic. Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination
	product. That determination is based on the &#147;primary mode of action&#148; of the combination product, which means the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, i.e., the mode of action
	expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a device-biologic combination product is attributable to the biologic product, that is, if it
	acts by means of a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the biologic product (the Center for Biologics
	Evaluation and Research, or CBER) would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. CBER is the agency component with primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation for our C-Cure investigational product. Because C-Cure
	utilizes a catheter as a delivery system to the heart, CBER may consult or collaborate with the agency center that is responsible for the premarket review of that device, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH.

	comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other

	The data required to support a BLA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. The pre-clinical development stage generally
	involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical studies must comply with federal
	regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, as well as other
	information, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s)
	for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In
	such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety
	concerns, non-compliance, or other issues affecting the integrity of the trial. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could
	cause the trial to be suspended or terminated. Where a trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is
	submitted to and the trial is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH
	Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is
	responsible for convening the Recombinant NDA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee, which discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public
	meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#146;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug product candidate to healthy volunteers and patients under the supervision of
	qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#146;s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any
	clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety
	and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at
	or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical
	trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial
	until completed.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public
	registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to
	the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical
	trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of trial-related
	information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving biologics that never garner approval could in the future require disclosure. In addition, publication policies of major medical journals mandate certain
	registration and disclosures as a pre-condition for potential publication, even if not currently mandated as a matter of law. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.

	Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap. Phase 1 clinical trials
	generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action,

	side effect tolerability and safety of the drug product candidate and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected
	patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and
	preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries, and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the product for its
	intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator
	treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain
	additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the
	biologic&#146;s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must
	be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans
	exposed to the biologic, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or
	investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds,
	including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in
	accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial
	sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated intervals based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a
	clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical
	characteristics of the drug product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality
	batches of the drug product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies
	must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Following trial completion, trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are
	then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the
	chemistry of the drug product candidate, and other relevant information. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which is
	demonstrated by extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. The application may include both negative or ambiguous results of pre-clinical and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials
	intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to
	establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which is adjusted on an annual basis.
	PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application
	fee for the first application filed by a small business.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, sixty days after the
	BLA&#146;s submission, the FDA&#146;s goal is to review BLAs within 10 months of the filing date for standard review or six months of the filing date for priority review, if the application is for a product intended for a serious or life-threatening
	condition and the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug product candidate is safe
	and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug product candidate&#146;s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency. The FDA may refer

	recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such
	recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of a BLA by the FDA is
	extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Before
	approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing
	processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving a BLA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to
	ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing
	of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete
	Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant
	and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or
	withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret
	data differently than we interpret the same data.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United
	States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific populations, severities of allergies, and dosages or the
	indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the
	approval of the BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For
	example, the FDA may require Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that
	have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the
	sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted
	distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be
	withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.

	Expedited Development and Review Programs
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet
	certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and non-clinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address
	unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or
	biologic as a Fast Track product concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the product qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request. Unique to a Fast
	Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA
	agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite
	development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review, or review within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete BLA is accepted for filing, if it has the potential to provide a
	significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an
	effort to facilitate the review.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. An investigational drug may obtain accelerated
	approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a
	clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a
	drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it
	will require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as:

	therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a drug product candidate be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently with, or at any time after, the submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if
	the drug product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product&#146;s marketing
	application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product&#146;s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather pre-clinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable,
	involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific

	control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution
	of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
	Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements
	with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified
	suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that
	interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of

	An abbreviated approval pathway for biological

	Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly
	similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be
	shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results
	as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times, that the product and the reference product may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished
	efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which

	A reference biological product is
	granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after first
	licensure. &#147;First licensure&#148; typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. This does not include a supplement for the biological product or a subsequent application by the same sponsor
	or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or
	strength, unless that change is a modification to the structure of the biological product and such modification changes its safety, purity, or potency. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the &#147;first

	regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the European Union Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to
	significant variations in the Member State regimes. To improve the current system, a new Regulation No.&nbsp;536/2014 on clinical trials on medicinal drug product candidates for human use, which repealed Directive 2001/20/EC, was adopted on
	April&nbsp;16, 2014, and published in the European Official Journal on May&nbsp;27, 2014. The new Regulation aims at harmonizing and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving
	the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency. The new Regulation entered into force on June&nbsp;16, 2014, but will apply not earlier than May&nbsp;28, 2016. Until then the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will still
	apply. In addition, the transitory provisions of the new Regulation offer the sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the Directive and the Regulation for one year from the entry into application of the Regulation.

	Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union countries where the trial is to be

	informed the Sponsor of the trial of any grounds for non-acceptance or confirmed that no such grounds exist. Approval will only be granted if satisfactory information demonstrating the quality of the investigational agent and its non-clinical safety
	has been provided, together with a study plan that details the manner in which the trial will be carried out.

	Sales of our products will depend, in part,
	on the extent to which our products, once approved, will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly
	reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product, including a biologic, typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug
	product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that a payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not
	include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any drug product candidate that might be
	approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the drug product candidate, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable
	regulatory approvals. Whether or not we conduct such studies, our drug product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an
	adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Third party
	reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs, including biologics, have been a focus in
	this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of
	generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party
	reimbursement for our drug product candidate or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug product candidate could reduce physician usage of the drug product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of

	pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the
	Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the full impact of the ACA on bio-pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of additional detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet

	In
	addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A
	Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic
	reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, started in April 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is
	taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011.
	The ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to
	providers from three to five years.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In Europe, pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products are not harmonized and fall within the exclusive competence of the national authorities,
	provided that basic transparency requirements (such as maximum timelines) defined at the European level are met as set forth in the EU Transparency Directive 89/105/EEC. A Member State may approve a specific price for a medicinal product or it may
	instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. For example, in France, effective access to the market assumes that our future products will be reimbursed by
	social security. The price of medications is negotiated with the Economic Committee for Health Products, or CEPS.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a consequence, reimbursement
	mechanisms by public national healthcare systems, or private health insurers also vary from country to country. In public healthcare systems, reimbursement is determined by guidelines established by the legislator or a competent national authority.
	In general, inclusion of a product in reimbursement schemes is dependent upon proof of the product efficacy, medical need, and economic benefits of the product to patients and the healthcare system in general. Acceptance for reimbursement comes with
	cost, use and often volume restrictions, which again vary from country to country.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The pricing and reimbursement level for medicinal products will depend
	on the strength of the clinical data set and, as for most novel therapies, restrictions may apply. In most countries, national competent authorities ensure that the prices of registered medicinal products sold in their territory are not excessive.
	In making this judgment, they usually compare the proposed national price either to prices of existing treatments and/or to prices of the product at issue in other countries &#150; so-called &#147;international reference pricing&#148; &#150; also
	taking into account the type of treatment (preventive, curative or symptomatic), the degree of innovation, the therapeutic breakthrough, volume of sales, sales forecast, size of the target population and/or the improvement (including cost savings)
	over comparable treatments. Given the growing burden of medical treatments on national healthcare budgets, reimbursement and insurance coverage is an important determinant of the accessibility of medicines.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The various public and private plans, formulary restrictions, reimbursement policies, patient advocacy groups, and cost-sharing requirements may play a role
	in determining effective access to the market of our product candidates. The national competent authorities may also use a range of policies and other initiatives intended to influence pharmaceutical consumption. There can be no assurance that any
	country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drug product candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not
	follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be priced at a significantly lower level.

	We are a leader in engineered cell therapy treatments with clinical programs initially targeting indications in cardiovascular disease and oncology. Our lead
	drug product candidate in cardiovascular disease is C-Cure, an autologous cell therapy for the treatment of patients with ischemic heart failure, or HF. We completed enrollment in our first Phase 3 clinical trial of C-Cure in Europe and Israel, or
	CHART-1, in March 2015. On March&nbsp;30, 2015, we announced that the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, reviewed unblinded safety and efficacy data from CHART-1 and determined that such unblinded safety and efficacy data did not support the
	discontinuation of the trial on the basis of safety or futility. These observations suggested that the trial should be continued in its current form. The full data readout from this trial is expected in the middle of 2016. We anticipate initiating
	our second Phase 3 clinical trial of C-Cure in the United States and Europe, or CHART-2, in June 2016, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, lifted the clinical hold that was on CHART-2 in December 2015. Our lead drug product candidate
	in oncology is NKR-2, an autologous chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, an artificial, lab engineered receptor, which is used to graft a given protein onto an immune cell, T lymphocyte, or CAR T-cell, therapy. We are currently enrolling patients with
	refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, or multiple myeloma, or MM, in a Phase 1 clinical trial of NKR-2in the United States. The first patient in the first cohort was treated in this trial in April 2015 and no treatment-related
	safety concerns were reported during the 30-day follow-up period for this patient or the other two patients treated in the first cohort The first patient in the second cohort was treated in this trial in December 2015. The safety outcome of the
	second cohort was disclosed on February&nbsp;24, 2016 and no treatment-related safety concerns were reported during the 21-day follow-up period. Interim data from this trial is expected to be reported at various times during the trial, with the full
	data readout of the first 12 patients and 4 doses expected in the middle of 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	All of our current drug product candidates are autologous cell therapy
	treatments. In autologous procedures, a patient&#146;s cells are harvested, selected, reprogrammed and expanded, and then infused back into the same patient. A benefit of autologous therapies is that autologous cells are not recognized as foreign by
	patients&#146; immune systems. We believe that we are well situated to effectively advance autologous cell therapy treatments for cancer and other indications as a result of the expertise and know-how that we have acquired through our development of
	C-Cure. We also believe that there are numerous operational synergies between our product platforms, including that, prior to commercialization, our existing pilot manufacturing plant can accommodate both of our cell therapy programs without
	significant capital expenditure.

	On November&nbsp;5, 2014, we acquired CorQuest Medical, Inc., a private U.S. company, or CorQuest, for a single cash

	shall be 2.0% of the value of the cash and non-cash consideration from such sale, or Net Revenue, if the Net Revenue is &#128;10.0&nbsp;million or less, and 4.0% of the Net Revenue, if the Net Revenue is greater than &#128;10.0 million.

	On January&nbsp;21, 2015, we purchased OnCyte, LLC, or OnCyte, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celdara Medical, LLC, a privately-held U.S. biotechnology company
	for an upfront payment of $10.0&nbsp;million, of which, $6.0 million was paid in cash and $4.0 million was paid in the form of 93,087 of our ordinary shares. A deferred payment of $5 million will be due upon the enrolment of the first patient of the
	second cohort of the NKR-T clinical trial. Additional contingent payments with an estimated fair value of $27.9 million are payable upon the attainment of various clinical and sales milestones. As a result of this transaction we acquired our NKR-T
	cell drug product candidates and related technology, including technology licensed from the Trustees of Dartmouth College.

	Manufacturing expenses represented 21%, 25% and 19% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
	For the periods presented in this report, manufacturing expenses only included the costs to manufacture C-Cure, but will include the cost of manufacturing our other clinical-stage drug product candidates in the future. These costs are mainly
	comprised of the salaries of the manufacturing team, production raw material and supplies, maintenance and calibration charges of equipment and the rental of Good Manufacturing Practices laboratory facilities. Raw materials are the main component to
	the current cost of production of C-Cure and will remain as such in the future as they are closely associated to the production of clinical batches. Most of our raw material suppliers are large companies, and pursuant to our internal procedures, we
	are trying to have an alternative supplier for each critical material, to limit risk of disruption and price sensitivity. The second largest caption in manufacturing expenses is the salaries of our production team. We do not anticipate an increase
	in salaries in 2016 and the years after. We lease our production facility from Biological Manufacturing Services SA. Manufacturing expenses are mostly driven by the number and the size of clinical trials that we conduct on our drug product
	candidates. We expect these expenses will remain significant in the near future and will increase as our clinical trials include a greater number of patients and we potentially commence commercialization of our drug product candidates, if approved.

	At the end of the research phase, we generally decide within a period of six months whether or not to exploit the
	results of the research phase; this phase is known as the decision phase. If we elect to exploit the results achieved under a RCA, we enter the exploitation phase, which may have a duration of up to ten years. If we elect to exploit the results
	under an RCA, the relevant RCA becomes contingently refundable, and we recognize a liability when it is probable that all or a portion of the RCA will be refunded and the amount to be refunded is estimable. The provision of the liability for amounts
	to be refunded under our RCA programs are recognized as a reduction of other operating income in the income statement.

	When we decide not to exploit, or

	rights related to such results are transferred to the Walloon Region. Also, when we decide to renounce our rights to patents which may result from the research, title to such patents are transferred to the Walloon Region.

	When we decide to discontinue the development program for which a financial liability has been accounted for, or decide not to exploit, or cease to exploit,

	Manufacturing expenses increased by &#128;2.7&nbsp;million in 2014 as compared to 2013. In 2014, manufacturing expenses were
	primarily related to the production of clinical lots of C-Cure for CHART-1, which was initiated in 2013. The first clinical lots were produced in the middle of 2013 with a slow ramp-up over the second part of 2013, whereas in 2014, all our

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The employee expenses increase year over year is a result of the hiring of 13 additional employees in

	Increase of production associated with the ramp-up of CHART-1 also explained the increase of &#128;1.1&nbsp;million
	of raw materials cost year over year. This increase is mostly related to the volume of raw materials consumed during CHART-1 as purchase prices remained stable throughout 2014.

	, manufactured by Creganna. The
	increase in such fees in 2014 compared to 2013 is due to the number of catheters used in CHART-1.

	All clinical, quality and regulatory expenses for the periods presented relate to CHART-1. The &#128;3.3&nbsp;million increase
	in these expenses in 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily related to the initiation of CHART-1 in the middle of 2013, resulting in only six months of trial expenses in 2013, as compared to 12 months of trial expenses in 2014. Trial costs are mainly
	driven by the costs of clinical vendors and investigators associated with clinical trial management. Trial management costs increased year over year due to the higher number of patients enrolled in CHART-1 in 2014. The employee expenses increase
	between 2013 and 2014 is due to an increase in the number of employees in our clinical and quality teams.

	The manufacturing expenses increased by &#128;1.3&nbsp;million in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2015, most of the manufacturing

	of C-Cure. Rent and utilities also increased significantly due to the facility leased in Rochester (MN).

	Clinical, Quality and Regulatory expenses increased by &#128;2.7&nbsp;million in 2015 compared to 2014. The vast
	majority of these expenses are related to the C-Cure clinical trials. The significant increase of these expenses resulted from the increase of the number of enrolled patients in CHART-1 which nearly doubled (182 patients in 2015 versus 108 in 2014)
	leading to an increase of about &#128;1.5&nbsp;million of CHART 1 costs. Another amount of &#128;1.2&nbsp;million has been dedicated to the preparation of the CHART 2 trial, the second phase III trial of C-Cure to be started in 2016 in the US. The
	clinical costs associated to the Phase 1 trial of NKR-2 are limited (&#128;0.2 million) as most of these costs are supported by contract by the former owner of the technology platform, Celdara Medical LLC.

	In 2015, preclinical research and development expenses amounted to &#128;5.9&nbsp;million, an increase of
	&#128;2.9&nbsp;million compared to 2014. This increase resulted primarily to the finalization of pre-clinical package of the future market authorization filing of C-Cure (&#128;+0.8 million), to the preclinical work associated to the Corquest
	platform (&#128;+0.5 million) and to the development of the NKR-T cell technology platform (&#128;+1.3 million). The preclinical development expenses of the NKR-T platform are expected to increase significantly in the future periods.

	Other operating income and expenses are primarily related to the non-dilutive funding received from the Walloon
	Region and the European FP7 funding programs. In 2015, the net amount of the other operating income and expenses decreased by &#128;4.1 million. This variance resulted mainly from the lower proceeds received from RCA and FP7 contracts (&#128;2.8
	million) and the deconsolidation of Cardio3 BioSciences Asia (&#128;0.6 million). Funding received and notification of funding from RCA and FP7 contracts amounted to &#128;0.6&nbsp;million in 2015.

	We believe that the net
	proceeds of the global offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements, based on the current scope of our activities, until
	at least the end of 2017. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In any event, we will require additional capital to pursue pre-clinical and
	clinical activities, obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize our drug product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Until we can generate a sufficient amount of
	revenue from our drug product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government, including RCAs and subsidies, or other third-party financings and
	collaborations. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue
	the development or commercialization of one or more of our drug product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing shareholders, increased fixed
	payment obligations and these securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as
	limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these
	events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.

	We may take

	we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue; (2)&nbsp;the date we qualify as a &#147;large accelerated filer,&#148; with at least $700 million of equity securities; (3)&nbsp;the issuance, in any three-year period, by our company of more than
	$1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities held by non-affiliates; and (4)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these
	exemptions. For example, Section&nbsp;107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting
	standards. Given that we currently report and expect to continue to report under IFRS as issued by the IASB, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised
	accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required by the IASB. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this Annual Report on Form 20-F. Accordingly, the information contained herein may
	be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold equity securities.

	As provided by Article 521 of the Belgian Company Code, the Company is managed by a Board of Directors acting as a collegiate body. The Board of
	Directors&#146; role is to pursue the long-term success of the Company by providing entrepreneurial leadership and enabling risks to be assessed and managed. The Board of Directors should decide on the Company&#146;s values and strategy, its risk
	preference and key policies. The Board of Directors should ensure that the necessary leadership, financial and human resources are in place for the Company to meet its objectives.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company has opted for a one-tier governance structure. As provided by Article 522 of the Belgian Company Code, the Board of Directors is the ultimate
	decision-making body in the Company, except with respect to those areas that are reserved by law or by the Company&#146;s articles of association to the Shareholders Meeting.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s articles of association state that the number of directors of the Company, who may be natural persons or legal entities and who need not be
	shareholders, must be at least 5. At least half of the members of the Board of Directors must be non-executive directors and at least three of them must be independent directors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A meeting of the Board of Directors is validly constituted if at least half of its members are present in person or represented at the meeting. If this quorum
	is not met, a new board meeting may be convened by any director to deliberate and decide on the matters on the agenda of the board meeting for which a quorum was not met, provided that at least two members are present. Meetings of the Board of
	Directors are convened by the Chairman of the Board or by at least two directors, whenever the interest of the Company so requires. In principle, the Board of Directors will meet at least four times per year.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Chairman of the Board of Directors shall have a casting vote on matters submitted to the Board of Directors in the event of a tied vote, save if the Board
	of Directors is composed of two members.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the date of this Report, the Board of Directors consists of 11 members, one of which is an executive director
	(as a member of the Executive Management Team) and 10 of which are non-executive directors, including four independent directors. In accordance with Art 96, &#167;2 6&deg; of the Belgian Company Code (hereafter &#147;BCC&#148;), it is the
	willingness of the Company to aim for, in a reasonable timeframe, that a third of the Board member are of different sex.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The role of our audit committee is to ensure the effectiveness
	of our internal control and risk management systems, the internal audit (if any) and its effectiveness and the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts, and to review and monitor the independence of the external auditor, in particular
	regarding the provision of additional services to the company. The committee reports regularly to our board of directors on the exercise of its functions. It informs our board of directors about all areas in which action or improvement is necessary
	in its opinion and produces recommendations concerning the necessary steps that need to be taken. The audit review and the reporting on that review cover us and our subsidiaries as a whole. The members of the audit committee are entitled to receive

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Article 524 of the
	Belgian Company Code provides for a special procedure that applies to intragroup or related party transactions with affiliates. The procedure applies to decisions or transactions between us and our affiliates that are not one of our subsidiaries.
	Prior to any such decision or transaction, our board of directors must appoint a special committee consisting of three independent directors, assisted by one or more independent experts. This committee must assess the business advantages and
	disadvantages of the decision or transaction, quantify its financial consequences and determine whether the decision or transaction causes a disadvantage to us that is manifestly illegitimate in view of our policy. If the committee determines that
	the decision or transaction is not illegitimate but will prejudice us, it must analyze the advantages and disadvantages of such decision or transaction and set out such considerations as part of its advice. Our board of directors must then make a
	decision, taking into account the opinion of the committee. Any deviation from the committee&#146;s advice must be justified. Directors who have a conflict of interest are not entitled to participate in the deliberation and vote. The
	committee&#146;s advice and the decision of the board of directors must be notified to our statutory auditor, who must render a separate opinion. The conclusion of the committee, an excerpt from the minutes of the board of directors and the opinion
	by the statutory auditor must be included in our annual report. This procedure does not apply to decisions or transactions in the ordinary course of business under customary market conditions and security documents, or to transactions or decisions
	with a value of less than 1% of our net assets as shown in our consolidated annual accounts.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have never declared or paid any cash
	dividends on our ordinary shares. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our equity securities in the foreseeable future and intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
	All of the ordinary shares, including in the form of the ADSs, offered by this report will have the same dividend rights as all of our other outstanding ordinary shares. In general, distributions of dividends proposed by our board of directors
	require the approval of our shareholders at a meeting of shareholders with a simple majority vote, although our board of directors may declare interim dividends without shareholder approval, subject to the terms and conditions of the Belgian Company
	Code.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to Belgian law, the calculation of amounts available for distribution to shareholders, as dividends or otherwise, must be determined on
	the basis of our non-consolidated statutory financial accounts prepared under Belgian GAAP, and not on the basis of IFRS consolidated accounts. In addition, under the Belgian Company Code, we may declare or pay dividends only if, following the
	declaration and issuance of the dividends, the amount of our net assets on the date of the closing of the last financial year according to our statutory annual accounts (i.e., the amount of the assets as shown in the balance sheet, decreased with
	provisions and liabilities, all as prepared in accordance with Belgian accounting rules), decreased with the non-amortized costs of incorporation and expansion and the non-amortized costs for research and development, does not fall below the amount
	of the paid-up capital (or, if higher, the called capital), increased with the amount of non-distributable reserves. Finally, prior to distributing dividends, we must allocate at least 5% of our annual net profits (under our non-consolidated
	statutory accounts prepared in accordance with Belgian accounting rules) to a legal reserve, until the reserve amounts to 10% of our share capital.

	From time to time we may become

	adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other

	,&#148; below, the gross amount of any distribution (before reduction for any amounts withheld in respect of Belgian withholding tax) actually or constructively received by a U.S. holder

	Distributions in excess of earnings and profits will be non-taxable to the U.S. holder to the extent of, and will be applied against and reduce, the U.S. holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs. Distributions in excess of earnings and profits
	and such adjusted tax basis will generally be taxable to the U.S. holder as either long-term or short-term capital gain depending upon whether the U.S. holder has held the ADSs for more than one year as of the time such distribution is received.
	However, since we do not calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, it is expected that any distribution will be reported as a dividend, even if that distribution would otherwise be treated as a non-taxable return

	dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year) generally will be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (a)&nbsp;if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States which the Secretary of Treasury of

	A U.S. holder generally may claim the amount of any Belgian withholding tax as either a deduction from gross income or a credit against U.S. federal income

	In general, the amount of a distribution paid to a U.S. holder in a foreign currency will be the dollar value of
	the foreign currency calculated by reference to the spot exchange rate on the day the U.S. holder receives the distribution, regardless of whether the foreign currency is converted into U.S. dollars at that time. The U.S. holder will take a tax
	basis in the foreign currency equal to their U.S. dollar equivalent on such date. The conversion of the foreign currency into U.S. dollars at a later date will give rise to foreign currency exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between their
	U.S. dollar equivalent at such later time and their tax basis. Any foreign currency gain or loss a U.S. holder recognizes on a subsequent conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss. If a distribution
	received in a foreign currency is converted into U.S. dollars on the day they are received, a U.S. holder should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the distribution. For foreign credit limitation purposes,
	distributions paid on ADSs that are treated as dividends will generally be foreign source income and will generally constitute passive category income.

	Passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, gains from commodities

	is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation and as receiving directly its proportionate share of the other corporation&#146;s income. If we are classified as a PFIC in any year

	be determined in large part by reference to the market price of the ADSs and our ordinary shares, which is likely to fluctuate after the global offering. In addition, the composition of our income and assets will be affected by how, and how quickly,
	we use the cash proceeds from the global offering in our business.

	distribution received by you in the shorter of the three preceding years or your holding period for the ADSs) and (b)&nbsp;any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs. Under this regime, any excess distribution and recognized

	Certain elections exist that may alleviate some of the adverse consequences of PFIC status. A U.S. holder may make an election to mark-to-market the U.S.

	adjusted tax basis of the ADSs over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously recognized as a result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in the
	ADSs will be adjusted to reflect these income or loss amounts. Any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of ADSs in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as an ordinary loss (but only to
	the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election). Gain or loss recognized on the sale or other disposition of ADSs in a year when we are not a PFIC will be a capital gain or loss. The
	mark-to-market election is available only if we are a PFIC and the ADSs are &#147;regularly traded&#148; on a &#147;qualified exchange.&#148; The ADSs will be treated as &#147;regularly traded&#148; in any calendar year in which more than a de
	minimis quantity of the ADSs are traded on a qualified exchange on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter (subject to the rule that trades that have as one of their principal purposes the meeting of the trading requirement as disregarded).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A stock market tax is normally levied on the purchase and the sale and on any other acquisition and transfer for consideration in Belgium of ADSs through a
	professional intermediary established in Belgium on the secondary market, so-called &#145;&#145;secondary market transactions.&#146;&#146; The tax is due from the transferor and the transferee separately. The applicable rate amounts to 0.27% of the
	consideration paid but with a cap of 800 euros per transaction and per party.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Belgian non-residents who purchase or otherwise acquire or transfer, for

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to the above, no stock market tax is payable by: (i)&nbsp;professional intermediaries described in Article 2, 9 and 10 of the Law of
	August&nbsp;2, 2002 acting for their own account, (ii)&nbsp;insurance companies described in Article 2, &#167;1 of the Law of July&nbsp;9, 1975 acting for their own account, (iii)&nbsp;professional retirement institutions referred to in Article 2,
	&#167;1 of the Law of October&nbsp;27, 2006 relating to the control of professional retirement institutions acting for their own account, or (iv)&nbsp;collective investment institutions acting for their own account. No stock exchange tax will thus
	be due by Holders on the subscription, purchase or sale of ADSs, if the Holders are acting for their own account. In order to benefit from this exemption, the Holders must file with the professional intermediary in Belgium a sworn affidavit
	evidencing that they are non-residents for Belgian tax purposes.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax, or FTT, in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain,
	France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia, or collectively, the Participating Member States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and
	could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in ADS&#146;s in certain circumstances. Under current proposals, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States.
	Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in ADSs where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, &#145;&#145;established&#146;&#146; in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances,
	including by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the
	Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation. Joint statements issued by participating Member States indicate an intention to implement the FTT by 1&nbsp;January 2016. Additional E.U. Member States may decide
	to participate. Prospective Holders of ADSs are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

	We are exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. Our
	overall risk management program focuses on preservation of capital given the unpredictability of financial markets.

</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are exposed to foreign exchange risk as certain collaborations or supply agreements of raw materials are denominated in USD. Moreover we have
	also investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk (USD). So far, because of the materiality of the exposure, we did not enter into any currency hedging arrangements. No sensitivity has been
	performed on the foreign exchange risk as up till now we still consider this risk as immaterial.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from
	various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the USD. Our functional currency is the Euro, but we have several of our product suppliers and clinical vendors invoicing US in USD or in other currencies. In addition, we plan to convert a
	substantial portion of the proceeds from the global offering to Euro.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have not established any formal practice to manage the foreign exchange risk
	against our functional currency. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had no trade receivables denominated in USD and had trade payables denominated in USD of $5.96 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Foreign exchange rate movements had no material effect on our results for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Because of our growing
	activities in the United States, the foreign exchange risk may increase in the future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2015, the percentage of our total costs expressed in $
	represented ~17% or $7.5 Mio. In the same period of 2014, it was 14&nbsp;% or $3.8 Mio. In 2016, the part of the $ expressed costs will increase due to the establishing of the US team&nbsp;&amp; offices as well as the large part of CHART 2 clinical
	studies to be initiated in the US.

	Act of 1934, as amended, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
	specified in the rules&nbsp;and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
	filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
	disclosure.&nbsp;Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
	control over financial reporting will provide absolute assurance that all appropriate information will, in fact, be communicated to Management to allow timely decisions to be made or prevent all error and fraud.&nbsp;A control system, no matter how
	well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.&nbsp;Additionally, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
	benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs.&nbsp;Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
	the company have been detected or that our control system will operate effectively under all circumstances.&nbsp;Moreover, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and
	there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	The Company did not maintain an adequate segregation of duties with respect to internal control over financial reporting and payroll processing
</I>
	. We
	have limited accounting personnel with the appropriate level of accounting and payroll knowledges, experience, and training commensurate with our financial reporting requirements to enable effective and proper segregation of duties to allow for
	appropriate monitoring of financial reporting matters and internal control over financial reporting. These control deficiencies did not result in material adjustments to the financial statements, however there is a reasonable possibility that a
	material misstatement of the annual financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis due to the failure to design and implement appropriate segregation of duty controls
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This annual report does not include a report of management&#146;s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of
	the company&#146;s registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There were
	changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
	As of December&nbsp;31 2014, we reported three material weaknesses (reference is made to the F-1 prospectus filed in June 2015). Since then, we have taken several remedial actions to address these material weaknesses. In particular, we have hired in
	2015 additional staff for the finance and legal departments, including a corporate controller and legal advisor. Also, the Group is working with an independent firm to better define, formalize and upgrade (when the case may be) our internal controls
	and processes with the goal of being compliant with the SOX regulation by end of 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of these actions, two out of three material weaknesses
	identified in the F-1 registration document are no longer valid. The lack of accounting resources to fulfill the reporting requirements of IFRS and the lack of comprehensive knowledge of IFRS accounting policies are no longer identified as material
	weaknesses as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	services does not impair the independent registered public accounting firm&#146;s independence from us and our management. Unless a type of service to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm has received general pre-approval

	Along with our articles of association, we adopted a corporate governance charter in accordance with the recommendations set out
	in the Belgian Corporate Governance Code issued on March&nbsp;12, 2009 by the Belgian Corporate Governance Committee. The Belgian Corporate Governance Code is based on a &#147;comply or explain&#148; system: Belgian listed companies are expected to
	follow the Belgian Corporate Governance Code, but can deviate from specific provisions and guidelines (though not the principles) provided they disclose the justification for such deviations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our board of directors complies with the Belgian Corporate Governance Code, but believes that certain deviations from its provisions are justified in view of
	our particular situation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These deviations include the grant of options or warrants to non-executive directors. In this way, we have additional
	possibilities to attract or retain competent non-executive directors and to offer them an attractive additional remuneration without the consequence that this additional remuneration weighs on our financial results. Furthermore, the grant of
	warrants is a commonly used method in the sector in which we operate. Without this possibility, we would be subject to a considerable disadvantage compared to competitors who do offer warrants to their non-executive directors. Our board of directors
	is of the opinion that the grant of options or warrants has no negative impact on the functioning of the non-executive directors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, Jean-Marc
	Heynderickx was appointed as a director on January&nbsp;31, 2013 for a duration of six years, which is in excess of the maximum duration of four years for a director&#146;s mandate provided by the Belgian Corporate Governance Code. This appointment
	was done at a time when the Corporate Governance Code was not applicable to us. In the future, we will ensure that no director&#146;s mandate will exceed the maximum duration of four years as provided by the Corporate Governance Code.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our board of directors reviews its corporate governance charter from time to time and makes such changes as it deems necessary and appropriate. Additionally,
	our board of directors adopted written terms of reference for each of the executive management team, the audit committee and the nomination and remuneration committee, which are part of the corporate governance charter.

	Differences between Our Corporate Governance Practices and the Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market
</B>
	The listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market
	include certain accommodations in the corporate governance requirements that allow foreign private issuers, to follow &#145;&#145;home country&#146;&#146; corporate governance practices in lieu of the otherwise applicable corporate governance
	standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The application of such exceptions requires that we disclose each noncompliance with the NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules that we do not follow and describe the Belgian corporate governance practices we do
	follow in lieu of the relevant NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance standard.

	Compensation Committee.

	NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Rule 5605(d)(2) requires that compensation of officers must be determined by, or recommended to, the board of directors for determination, either by a majority

	independent directors or a nominations committee comprised solely of independent directors. Under Belgian law, we are not subject to any such requirements. In particular, we are not required by Belgian law to set up any compensation or nominations
	committees within our board of directors, and are therefore not subject to any Belgian legal requirements as to the composition of such committees either. However, our articles of association provide that our board of directors may form committees
	from among its members. Our board of directors has set up and appointed a nomination and remuneration committee. Pursuant article 526
<I>

	perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset. The IASB has also clarified that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for measuring the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in an intangible asset.

	The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is measured at the aggregate of the fair values

	The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint
	ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the group&#146;s
	share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income. When the group&#146;s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that,
	in substance, form part of the group&#146;s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group&#146;s interest in the joint ventures.
	Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by
	the Group.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	When the group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or significant influence,
	any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained
	interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or
	liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

	are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in

	The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A
	financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that loss event has
	an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

	For
	financial assets carried at amortized cost the Group first assesses individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not
	individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and
	collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.

	The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income statement. Interest

	income in the income statement. Loans together with the associated allowance are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because
	of an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to the income

	The Group operates a pension plan which requires contributions to be made by the Group to an insurance company. The pension plans is
	classified as a defined contribution plan. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions per employee into a separate fund. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further
	contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits they are entitled to under the existing schemes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However,
	because of the Belgian legislation applicable to 2nd pillar pension plans (so-called &#147;Law Vandenbroucke&#148;), all Belgian defined contribution plans have to be considered under IFRS as defined benefit plans. Law Vandenbroucke states that in
	the context of defined contribution plans, the employer must guarantee a minimum return of 3.75% on employee contributions and 3.25% on employer contributions. Because of this minimum guaranteed return for defined contributions plans in Belgium, the
	employer is exposed to a financial risk (there is a legal obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Prior to 2014, the Group did not apply the defined benefit accounting for these plans because higher discount rates were applicable and the return on plan
	assets provided by the insurance company was sufficient to cover the minimum guaranteed return. As a result of continuous low interest rates offered by the European financial markets, in 2014 Celyad has decided to measure and account for the
	potential impact of defined benefit accounting for these pension plans with a minimum fixed guaranteed return because of the higher financial risk related to these plans than in the past. The prior year financial statements were not revised due to
	such effect not being material.

	The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of the

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group is exposed to foreign
	exchange risk as certain collaborations or supply agreements of raw materials are denominated in USD. Moreover the Group has also investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk (USD). So far,
	because of the materiality of the exposure, the Group did not enter into any currency hedging arrangements. No sensitivity has been performed on the foreign exchange risk as up till now this risk is still considered as immaterial by the Group.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The preparation of the Group&#146;s financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are
	believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the process of applying the Group&#146;s accounting policies, management has made judgments and has used estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
	The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the
	next financial year are addressed below.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Advances received from the Walloon Region only become contingently reimbursable if the Company notifies the Region of its decision to exploit the outcome of
	the research program funded with the advances received. At the end of this research phase, the Group should, within a period of six months, decide whether or not to exploit the results of the research programs (&#145;decision phase&#146;). In the
	event the Group decides to exploit the results under an RCA, the relevant RCA becomes contingently repayable to the Walloon Region and the Company determines its liability under IAS 37. When a contingent liability is recognized, estimates are
	required to determine the discount rate used to calculate the present value of those contingent liabilities as well as the determination of the estimated cash flows.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The reimbursements of the RCAs to the Walloon Region consist of two elements, i.e., sales-dependent reimbursements (a percentage of sales) and
	sales-independent reimbursements (an annual lump-sum). For more information we refer to Note 19.

	In respect of acquired businesses by the Group, significant judgement is made to determine whether these acquisitions are to be considered as an asset deal or

	management judgement is particularly involved in the recognition and fair value measurement of the acquired assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration. In making this assessment management considers the underlying
	economic substance of the items concerned in addition to the contractual terms. For more information, we refer to Note 14.

	regulatory approval processes with the aim of obtaining CE mark approval by the end of 2016 which would allow commercialization in Europe. In order to guarantee the transfer of knowledge an exclusive consultancy agreement was concluded with one of
	the sellers.

	This acquisition has been subject to a Purchase Price Allocation, process which consists in booking, at &#147;fair
	value&#148;, all the assets and liabilities of a target company acquired in the consolidated balance sheet of the acquiring company. The acquired assets and liabilities have been valued at fair value by the Group with the assistance of an
	independent third-party valuation firm.

	The sales price also includes a contingent consideration payment, the potential remaining part of the purchase
	price, based on future outcome of the research and development and potential future sales that are estimated, through a risk-adjusted Net Present Value, at $27.9 million, considering the impact of the discount and the probability of success
	(&#128;25.5 million)). For the successful development of the most advanced product CM-CS1, the seller could receive up to $45 million in development and regulatory milestones until market approval. The seller will be eligible to additional payments
	on the other products upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones totalling up to $36.5 million per product. In addition, the seller will receive up to $80 million in sales milestones when net sales will exceed $1 billion and royalties
	ranging from 5 to 8%.

	The group had no contingent
	consideration financial liabilities at 31&nbsp;December 2014 and there were no transactions in contingent consideration during the year ended 31&nbsp;December 2014. Therefore comparative information is not applicable. Except the contingent
	consideration resulting from the business combination mentioned above, the carrying amount of all other financial assets and financial liabilities is a reasonable approximation of the fair value. There were no changes in valuation techniques during
	the period.

	The Company initially fair valued the assets and liabilities in its 2014 annual report at &#128;44.9&nbsp;million (disclosed as a subsequent
	event). This provisional fair value was taken out of a report drafted by an independent valuation expert (and endorsed by the Group) based on assumptions and a business plan provided by the Company. Since then, the Company reassessed the said
	assumptions and adjusted the business plan. The main drivers leading to changes in the business plan the were probability of success of the clinical programs of the different product candidates and timelines of the commercialization of the products.

	At the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting of 5&nbsp;May 2014, a plan of 100,000 warrants was approved. Warrants were offered to Company&#146;s new comers

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The 100,000 warrants will be vested in equal tranches over a period of three years. The warrants become 100% vested after the third anniversary the issuance.
	The warrants that are vested can only be exercised at the end of the third calendar year following the issuance date, thus starting on 1&nbsp;January 2018. The exercise price amounts of the different tranches amount respectively to &#128;33.49 and
	&#128;45.05. Warrants not exercised within 10 years after issue become null and void.

	The Group operates a pension plan which requires contributions to be made by the Group to an insurance company.
	The pension plan is a defined contribution plan. However, because of the Belgian legislation applicable to 2nd pillar pension plans (so-called &#147;Law Vandenbroucke&#148;), all Belgian defined contribution plans have to be accounted for under IFRS
	as defined benefit plans because of the minimum guaranteed returns on these plans.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Prior to 2014, the Group did not apply the defined benefit accounting
	for these plans because higher discount rates were applicable and the return on plan assets provided by the insurance company was sufficient to cover the minimum guaranteed return. Since 2014 and as a result of continuous low interest rates offered
	by the European financial markets, Celyad is at year end measuring and accounting for the potential impact of defined benefit accounting for these pension plans with a minimum fixed guaranteed return because of the higher financial risk related to
	these plans than in the past. The prior year financial statements were not revised due to such effect not being material.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The contributions to the plan
	are determined as a percentage of the yearly salary. There are no employee contributions. The benefit also includes a death in service benefit.

	The Group receives government support in the form of recoverable cash advances from the Walloon Region in order to compensate
	the research and development costs incurred by the Group. These advances are recognized in the income statement as other operating income over the period in which the Group recognizes the expenses for which the advances are intended to compensate.

	The advances received only become contingently reimbursable if certain conditions are met. Assessing if these conditions are met (or not) can only
	reasonably be performed at the end of the &#145;research phase&#146;. At the end of this research phase, the Group should, within a period of six months, decide whether or not to exploit the results of the research programs (&#145;decision
	phase&#146;). In the event the Group decides to exploit the results under an RCA, the relevant RCA becomes contingently refundable to the Walloon Region and the company applies the recognition criteria of IAS 37 related to liability recognition,
	with any amounts being recognized as a reduction of other operating income in the income statement.

	The loss per share is calculated by dividing loss for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. As the Group is
	incurring net losses, outstanding warrants have an anti-dilutive effect. As such, there is no difference between the basic and the diluted earnings per share. In case the warrants would be included in the calculation of the loss per share, this
	would decrease the loss per share.
