</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a specialty pharmaceutical company that is developing and commercializing, either on our own or in partnerships with third parties, new
	applications of approved therapeutics to address important unmet medical needs using both proven and new drug delivery technologies. We have developed and are continuing to develop pharmaceutical products aimed principally in the areas of pain
	management and addiction. We were incorporated in the State of Indiana in 1997 and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2002.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our approved products utilize the novel, patent protected and proprietary
<I>
	BioErodible MucoAdhesive
</I>
	(or BEMA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	FDA) approved product, ONSOLIS
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	technology.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have worked with other delivery technologies in the past, and as part of our corporate growth strategy, we have licensed, and will continue
	to seek to acquire or license, additional drug delivery technologies or drugs utilizing the delivery or other technologies of other companies. Clonidine Topical Gel, which we licensed from Arcion Therapeutics (or Arcion) in 2013, and our 2015
	agreement with Evonik Corporation (or Evonik) to develop a buprenorphine depot injection formulation, do not utilize the BEMA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	technology and allowed us to diversify our portfolio while
	maintaining a focus in pain and addiction. As we gain access to such technologies, we seek to formulate these technologies with proven, FDA approved therapeutics and utilize our development and commercialization experience to, either by ourselves or
	through partnerships, navigate the resulting products through the regulatory review process and ultimately bring them to the marketplace.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our current development strategy focuses primarily on our ability to utilize the FDA&#146;s 505(b)(2) approval process to obtain more timely
	and efficient approval of new formulations of previously approved, active therapeutics incorporated into our drug delivery technology. Because the 505(b)(2) approval process is designed to address new formulations of previously approved drugs, we
	believe it has the potential to be more cost efficient and expeditious and have less regulatory approval risk than other FDA approval approaches.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that the widespread use of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence and the need for improved means of delivery to
	address existing administration challenges present an important commercial opportunity. Therefore, we developed a BEMA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone specifically for the treatment
	of opioid dependence. The product combines a &#147;high dose&#148; of buprenorphine along with an abuse deterrent agent, naloxone. BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	provides us with an opportunity to compete in the
	growing opioid dependence market which, according to Symphony Health, exceeded $2.0 billion in sales in the U.S in 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In September
	2012, we announced the positive outcome of the pivotal pharmacokinetic study comparing BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	to Suboxone
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	sublingual tablets. The
	study was designed to compare the relative bioavailability of buprenorphine and naloxone between BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	and the reference product,
	Suboxone
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	tablets. The results demonstrated that the two key pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum drug plasma concentration (Cmax) and total drug exposure (AUC), for buprenorphine were
	comparable to Suboxone
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	sublingual tablet, and that the same parameters for naloxone were similar or less than Suboxone
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	was followed by initiation of the safety study requested by FDA, assessing the safety and tolerability of BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	in patients converted from a stable dose of Suboxone
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	(buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual tablets or films. A total of 249 patients were enrolled in the study, (191 patients completed) which completed in December 2012. Results of the study
	showed a very favorable safety and tolerability profile along with strong study subject retention and high dose form acceptability ratings. Data showed that over 91% of patients who switched from
	Suboxone
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	film or tablets considered the taste of BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	to be very pleasant, pleasant or neutral and over 82% rated the ease of use
	of BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	as very easy, easy or neutral. The study also showed a decrease in the incidence of constipation symptoms from 41% at baseline, before conversion of patients from Suboxone tablets
	or films to BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	One of the key intellectual property milestones under our Endo Agreement was achieved in February 2012, when the U.S. Patent and Trademark

	We believe that the PDN market is highly under-served by existing

	diabetic foot pain. A significant treatment difference was seen in the planned subset analysis of diabetic patients who had documented evidence of &#147;functioning pain receptors&#148; in the skin of the lower leg (p=0.01, n=63) thus, at a minimum,

	We met with representatives of the FDA on November&nbsp;21, 2013
	to discuss the development program for Clonidine Topical Gel for the treatment of PDN. The FDA agreed with the proposed clinical program which included two placebo-controlled studies and one long term safety study in patients suffering from painful
	diabetic neuropathy, the number of treated subjects required for the safety assessment and the plan for data integration of previously performed and planned clinical studies. The discussion provided us with the input and clarity needed to move the
	program directly to Phase 3. It also appears that the FDA recognizes the need for new treatment options for PDN by confirming Fast Track designation for the program that could potentially lead to a priority review.

	In March 2015, we announced that the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 3 study of Clonidine Topical Gel compared to
	placebo did not meet statistical significance, although certain secondary endpoints showed statistically significant improvement over placebo. Final analysis of the study identified a sizeable patient population with a statistically significant
	improvement (n=158; p&lt;0.02) in pain score vs placebo. Following thorough analysis of the data and identification of the reasons behind the study results, we initiated a second study. Such study incorporates significant learnings from previously
	conducted studies and involves tightened and additional inclusion criteria to improve assay sensitivity, reduce bias and ensure compliance with enrollment criteria. The final study subject is expected to complete treatment by the end of 2016.

	In 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Evonik to develop and commercialize a proprietary, injectable microparticle formulation of
	buprenorphine potentially capable of providing 30 days of continuous therapy following a single subcutaneous injection. Microsphere-based, long acting, buprenorphine injectable depot has the ability to change the treatment paradigm in opioid
	dependence. Such a dosage form has the opportunity to improve therapy compliance through continuous delivery of drug for up to 30 days and addresses challenges regarding patient adherence to long-term buprenorphine treatment, which is critical to
	successfully manage opioid dependence and the potential for misuse and diversion.

	Endo Licensing Agreement for BELBUCA&#153;
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On January&nbsp;6, 2012, we announced the signing of a world-wide licensing and development agreement for BELBUCA&#153; with Endo. Under terms
	of the agreement, Endo is responsible for the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales of BELBUCA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&#153;
</SUP>
	on a worldwide basis. Endo will commercialize BELBUCA&#153; outside the U.S. through
	its own efforts or through regional partnerships. In the U.S., both companies collaborated on the planning and finalization of the Phase 3 clinical development program and regulatory strategy for BELBUCA&#153; for chronic pain. On October&nbsp;23,
	2015 the FDA approved BELBUCA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&#153;
</SUP>
	for licensing in the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	aggregate, the agreement is worth up to $180 million to us if all milestones or thresholds are met, which includes an upfront non-refundable license fee of $30 million (received January 2012), as well as intellectual property, development,
	regulatory and commercial milestone and sales threshold payments. Additionally, we will receive a tiered mid to upper teen royalty on U.S. net sales of BELBUCA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&#153;
</SUP>
	and a tiered mid to upper
	single-digit royalty on sales outside the U.S. One of the key intellectual property milestones under our Endo Agreement was achieved when, in April 2012, the USPTO granted US Patent No.&nbsp;8,147,866 (issued from US Patent Application
	No.&nbsp;13/184,306), which will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	drug delivery technology for BELBUCA&#153; (as well as BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	discussed below) from 2020 to 2027. As a result (and included in the aforementioned $180 million if all milestones or thresholds are met), we received a milestone payment in the amount of $15 million in May 2012, and also received an additional
	milestone payment of $20 million which was paid at the time of approval of a NDA by the FDA for BELBUCA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&#153;
</SUP>
	. The aforementioned $20 million patent-related payment will be earned over the
	extended patent period from 2020 to 2027. Additionally, we achieved another milestone with the locking of the database for our Phase 3 opioid naive clinical study on January&nbsp;17, 2014. For the achievement of this milestone, per the terms of the
	agreement, we were due a milestone payment in the amount of $10 million, which was received February 2014 (which is included in the aforementioned $180 million if all milestones or thresholds are met) within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the database
	lock. On June&nbsp;25, 2014, the database for the pivotal Phase 3 efficacy study of BELBUCA&#153; in opioid-experienced patients was locked.&nbsp;The locking of the database triggered a $10 million milestone payment from Endo, which was received
	July 2014. On December&nbsp;23, 2014, we and Endo announced the submission of a NDA for BELBUCA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&#153;
</SUP>
	to the FDA, which was accepted February&nbsp;23, 2015, which triggered a $10 million milestone
	payment due from Endo to us. As stated above, on October&nbsp;23, 2015 the FDA approved BELBUCA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&#153;
</SUP>
	for licensing in the United States, which we announced on October&nbsp;26, 2015. The
	FDA&#146;s approval of BELBUCA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&#153;
</SUP>
	triggered a milestone payment to us from Endo of $50 million, of which $20 million has been deferred for future revenue recognition as the payment is
	contingently refundable in the event a generic product is commercially launched during the patent extension period.

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	.&nbsp;The CDLA includes minimum royalties of $375,000 per quarter beginning in the second full year following commercial launch.&nbsp;The minimum provision came into effect in 2011. The royalty

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	contains the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine, which binds to the same receptors as opiate drugs but has a higher affinity, slower onset and is both less
	addictive and less lethal in overdose. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is included as an abuse deterrent. When used as directed, the naloxone is swallowed and minimally absorbed; however, if misused (ie, dissolved and injected), the naloxone rapidly
	precipitates withdrawal symptoms.

	Maintenance treatment with buprenorphine reduces the typical cravings and withdrawal symptoms

	In August 2014, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published in the Federal
	Register their final ruling moving hydrocodone combination products (such as Vicodin, Lortab, Norco, etc.) from Schedule III to the more-restrictive Schedule II, as recommended by the Assistant Secretary for Health of the U.S. Department of Health
	and Human Services (HHS) and as supported by the DEA&#146;s own evaluation of relevant data. As a result of the ruling, hydrocodone containing products are now classified in the same category (Schedule II) as morphine and oxycodone. As a result of
	the change to Schedule II, access to these products will be more restricted. Among other changes, written prescriptions will be required and refills will not be permitted. The ruling also conveyed findings that hydrocodone combination products have
	a higher risk of abuse and addiction compared to Schedule III products. The ruling went into full effect in October 2014.

	We recognized
	early the value of buprenorphine in the treatment of pain. Buprenorphine is one of the few remaining Schedule III opioids and has a lower risk of abuse and addiction compared to Schedule II opioids and thus will have fewer restrictions on
	dispensing. BELBUCA&#153; has the opportunity to provide a Schedule III option for the treatment of chronic pain thus help to replace the void left from the recent reclassification of hydrocodone combination products. We believe the actions taken to
	restrict the use of hydrocodone combination products may markedly increase the utility and appeal of BELBUCA&#153; as it now addresses an important unmet medical need for Schedule III options.

	In addition to direct competitors, there are other factors that impact the market for pain products in general. The significant pricing
	pressures and availability of generic products in the U.S. and other regions are likely to have increasing influence on the pharmaceutical market, including pain products. Additionally, opioids continue to garner increased scrutiny based on the
	growing problem of prescription drug abuse and addiction. It remains unclear what steps, if any beyond the reclassification of hydrocodone, the FDA or other government agencies may take to address the problem of opioid abuse and addiction. However,
	in July 2012 the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program for the extended release and long-acting opioids. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education,
	patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA&#153; falls within the existing class-wide REMS program.

	, in the breakthrough cancer pain area, the market has become increasingly crowded and more competitive in recent years. The principal competitor has traditionally been Teva Pharmaceutical

	) and effervescent buccal tablet (Fentora
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	(fentanyl sublingual spray) from
	Insys, have gained significant market share. Additional competitors include Sentynl Therapeutics which licensed from Galena Biopharma the sublingual tablet formulation of fentanyl (Abstral

	On December&nbsp;29, 2011, the FDA approved a REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products. The program, which is referred to as
	the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure
	appropriate use. The approved program covers all marketed transmucosal fentanyl products, including ONSOLIS

	In March 2013, we announced that we had entered into a worldwide licensing agreement with privately held Arcion, where we will develop and
	commercialize Clonidine Topical Gel (formerly ARC4558) for the treatment of PDN and potentially other indications. The PDN market is highly under-served by existing products and there is a strong scientific rationale for developing a topical
	treatment for PDN that delivers analgesia in a way that avoids systemic side effects.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Evidence has shown that clonidine stimulates an
	inhibitory receptor in the skin associated with pain fibers. Arcion has developed a patented topical gel formulation of clonidine and has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pain in PDN in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study where
	the primary study endpoint was the change in pain intensity over a 3 month treatment period in diabetic foot pain. A significant treatment difference was seen in the planned subset analysis of diabetic patients who had documented evidence of
	&#147;functioning pain receptors&#148; in the skin of the lower leg (p=0.01, n=63) thus, at a minimum, supporting the effectiveness of topical clonidine in diabetic patients with functioning pain receptors of the skin. In the overall population that
	included patients without &#147;functioning nerve receptors&#148;, there was a trend favoring Clonidine Topical Gel (p=0.07, n= 182), though the overall results did not reach statistical significance.

	Nearly 26&nbsp;million people in the U.S. have diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association. A substantial number of these people
	have neuropathy as manifest by impaired sensation and pain in the extremities, most commonly the feet. Patients with PDN often experience debilitating pain symptoms that affect day-to-day functioning and quality of life. How diabetes causes a
	length-dependent neuropathy is unknown. In the prior double-blind, randomized, controlled trial approximately 50% of the patients with PDN demonstrated functional nociceptors in the skin in the painful region as revealed by a response to topical
	capsaicin. Clonidine is thought to relieve pain by decreasing the abnormal excitability of these functional nociceptors. Currently available oral treatments are modestly effective in relieving symptoms and are limited by systemic side effects and
	drug interactions. There are no topical products approved for the treatment of this painful condition.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Along with antidepressants,
	antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are often used as a first-line therapy for PDN. The most commonly prescribed AEDs for PDN are gabapentin and pregabalin (Lyrica). The choice between them is mostly influenced by physicians&#146; preference for the
	more-favorable dosing attributes (less-frequent daily dosing, faster titration) of pregabalin in balance with price and accessibility. AEDs are commonly associated with side effects including somnolence, dizziness, and weight gain. If first-line AED
	or antidepressant monotherapy fails to provide acceptable pain relief, physicians initiate combination therapy. If AED/antidepressant combination therapy is not effective, physicians typically add a dual-acting opioid such as tramadol. For
	more-severe pain, physicians may add or switch to tapentadol ER (Nucynta ER), which is the first and only dual-acting opioid analgesic to gain approval for PDN in the U.S. If pain persists with the addition of tramadol or tapentadol, physicians
	often switch to a more potent opioid analgesic (e.g., oxycodone) while maintaining AED and/or antidepressant therapy. Although some experts acknowledge that strong opioids can be quite effective for PDN, they generally reserve this drug class for
	refractory cases and/or those with high pain intensity. For some PDN patients, particularly those experiencing highly localized pain, physicians may prescribe the lidocaine 5% patch (Lidoderm). Pain specialists generally consider that lidocaine is
	particularly beneficial for localized pain, and many physicians prefer it to oral agents because it does not cause systemic side effects and is easy to administer. In many cases, the patch is used in combination with an oral first-line AED and/or
	antidepressant therapy.

	challenges remain regarding patient adherence to long-term buprenorphine treatment, which is critical to successfully managing opioid dependence. This has led to interest in alternative delivery systems for buprenorphine. One such opportunity is the
	development of an injectable, long-acting, depot formulation. Microsphere-based, long acting, buprenorphine injectable depot has the ability to change the treatment paradigm in opioid dependence and pain management. Such a dosage form provides
	improved therapy compliance through continuous delivery of drug for up to 30 days.&nbsp;In 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Evonik to develop and commercialize a proprietary, injectable microparticle formulation of buprenorphine
	potentially capable of providing 30 days of continuous therapy following a single subcutaneous injection. While we plan to pursue an indication for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, we have also secured the rights and are developing a
	product for the treatment of chronic pain in patients requiring continuous opioid therapy. As part of the agreement, we will have the right to license the product(s) following the attainment of Phase 1 ready formulations. At that point, Evonik could
	receive downstream payments for milestones related to regulatory filings and subsequent NDA approvals as well as product royalties. Evonik has the exclusive rights to develop the formulation and manufacture the product(s). In 2015, significant
	progress was made in the development of a formulation we believe will allow for delivery once per month as well as provide advantages over other injectable buprenorphine products.

	on the &#145;292 patent, in which all the original broader claims were replaced with narrower, new claims. As for the &#145;588 patent, at the conclusion of the reexamination proceedings (and its appeals process), on April&nbsp;17, 2014, the Patent
	Trial and Appeal Board (or PTAB) of the USPTO issued a Decision on Appeal affirming the Examiner&#146;s rejection (and confirming the invalidity) of all the claims of the &#146;588 Patent. MonoSol did not request a rehearing by the May&nbsp;17, 2014

	Following, and assuming, completion of clinical development and regulatory approval for each candidate product, we will pursue one of several

	Following a thorough assessment of commercialization options for BUNAVAIL

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	supports our longer term vision to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company. The dynamics of the opioid dependence
	market made self-commercialization a feasible and attractive option. In total, approximately 90% of all prescriptions are written by approximately 5,000 physicians &#150; which include primary care physicians, psychiatrists, addiction medicine
	specialists and pain specialists, with most concentrated in the eastern third of the U.S. and the west coast, allowing for coverage of a majority of the prescriber base with a modest sized sales force. Additionally, the relatively small prescriber
	base along with the limited number of competitors results in relatively modest marketing expenditures. And finally, the high awareness and physician acceptance of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence lessens the need for costly
	educational and promotional programs.

	The nonclinical and clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of any drug product, is subject to significant regulation by governmental
	authorities in the United States and other countries. Complying with these regulations involves considerable time, expense and uncertainty.

	In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous federal regulation and, to a lesser extent, state regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and
	Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval,
	advertising and promotion of our drugs. Drug development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, ongoing legislation by
	Congress and rule making by the FDA presents an ever-changing landscape where we could be required to undertake additional activities before any governmental approval to market our products is granted.

	When there is evidence that the product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in

	New Drug Application and FDA Approval Process
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The results of the pharmaceutical and manufacturing development work, nonclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the
	FDA in the form of an NDA for approval to market and sell the product. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort. In addition to the results of nonclinical and clinical testing, the NDA applicant must submit
	detailed information about chemistry, manufacturing and controls that will describe how the product is made, packaged, labeled, and tested through the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process continues to develop throughout the period of
	clinical trials such that at the time of the NDA, it has been demonstrated that there is control of the process and the product can be made consistently at commercial scale.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The NDA review process involves FDA investigation into the details of the manufacturing process, as well as the design and analysis of each of
	the nonclinical and clinical studies. This review includes inspection of the manufacturing facility, the data recording process for the clinical studies, the record keeping at a sample of clinical trial sites and a thorough review of the results for
	each nonclinical and clinical study. Through this review, the FDA reaches a decision about the risk-benefit profile of a product candidate. If the benefit outweighs the risk, the FDA begins negotiation with the company on the content of an
	acceptable package insert and an associated REMS plan if required.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The NDA review process is affected by a number of factors, including
	the severity of the disease, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Consequently, there is a risk that approval may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny
	approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed, require additional testing or
	information, or require post-marketing testing (Phase 4) and surveillance to monitor the safety of a company&#146;s product if it does not believe the NDA contains adequate evidence of its safety. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if
	compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or health problems are identified that would alter the risk-benefit analysis for the product. Post-approval studies may be conducted to explore the use of the product for new indications or
	populations such as pediatrics.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that any prospective manufacturer&#146;s quality
	control and manufacturing procedures conform to Good Manufacturing Practices and the specifications approved in the NDA. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the
	area of quality control and quality assurance to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other federal, state or local
	agencies. Additionally, in the event of non-compliance, the FDA may issue warning letters and/or seek criminal and civil penalties, enjoin manufacture, seize product or revoke approval.

	Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In March 2008, new legislation designated as the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA) took effect. This legislation
	strengthened the FDA&#146;s authority over drug safety and directs the FDA to develop systems aimed at managing the risk-benefit ratio of a drug, with a particular focus on post-approval safety. FDAAA authorized the FDA to require and enforce a Risk
	Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the potential risks. The legislation also provides the FDA with increased authority to require REMS at any point
	in a drug product&#146;s lifecycle based on new safety information.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A REMS is defined by the FDA as a strategy to manage a known or
	potential serious risk associated with a drug or biological product. The FDA&#146;s assessment of whether to require a REMS as a condition for approval considers factors such as the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of
	the disease or condition that is to be treated by the drug, the expected benefit, and the seriousness of any known or potential adverse events that may be related to the drug. A REMS may be conveyed through the use of a number of tools including a
	Medication Guide for distribution when the drug is dispensed, a communication plan to physicians to convey potential risks, and elements to ensure safe use. These elements may include provisions that healthcare providers who prescribe the drug and
	pharmacists who dispense the drug have particular training, experience or special certifications; that the drug be dispensed only in certain healthcare settings; that the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence of safe-use conditions; and/or
	that patients must be enrolled in a registry. Under the FDAAA, the FDA has also been granted enforcement authority over violations of the REMS provisions. The FDA may impose civil monetary penalties, the drug or biological product can be deemed
	misbranded, and/or the FDA may obtain injunctive relief against further distribution of the product.

	From our inception in January 1997 and through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have recorded significant losses. Our accumulated deficit at
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 was approximately $243.2 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had working capital of approximately $64 million, but we do not generate meaningful recurring revenue or cash flow and thus use our working capital to maintain
	our operations. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to complete the development of our product candidates and product concepts, obtain the required regulatory approvals and
	manufacture, market and sell our products if approved. We may be unable to achieve any or all of these goals.

	, sales have been minimal as we have only recently commenced the
	commercial launch of the product in November 2014 and are subject to the risks of launching a new product. There is a risk that we will be unable to generate sustained and predictable revenues from product sales. In the case of BELBUCA&#153;, our
	recent approval has only recently generated milestone revenue from our commercial partner. In the case of ONSOLIS
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;,
</SUP>
	sales have been adversely affected by: (i)&nbsp;the lack of a uniform REMS
	program at the time of the launch of ONSOLIS
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	In 2014, we commenced the commercial launch of
	BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	is important to us, both for the revenue it may generate as well as to demonstrate our capabilities as an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company as opposed to a research and development
	organization. The commercial launch of any product is subject to significant risks, and particularly so for us given the size and relative in experience of our company with commercial operations. In addition, we face lengthy customer evaluation and
	formulary and managed care approval processes associated with the launch of BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	. Consequently, we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses and devote significant management
	effort and expense in developing customer trial and adoption of BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	which may not actually occur or may occur with less favorable terms. The sales of BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	are also dependent on the effectiveness of our selling and promotional efforts as well as influenced
	by competitive activity, new product approvals, pricing pressure, litigation, regulatory influences, and generic entrants. We have to some extent experienced all of the foregoing in connection with our launch of BUNAVAIL

	As such, we cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of any future sales of BUNAVAIL

	Prior to our decision to commercialize BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	and Endo for
	BELBUCA&#153;.&nbsp;We therefore have little experience as a company in commercializing a product, and our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities are new.&nbsp;As such, we may not achieve success in marketing and promoting BUNAVAIL

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	, we must execute upon our commercialization plan effectively and efficiently. In addition, we must continually assess and modify our commercialization plan in order to

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	Our management&#146;s expertise has primarily been in the areas of research and development, formulation development and clinical trial phases
	of pharmaceutical product development. Our management&#146;s experience in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products is more limited and we have limited equipment and no facilities of our own from which these activities could be performed.
	Therefore, we are fully dependent on third parties for our formulation development, manufacturing and the packaging of our products. This is particularly true with respect to ARx and Sharp, the primary manufacturers of our approved and
	commercialized product, BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	Furthermore, these third party contractors, whether foreign or domestic, may experience regulatory compliance difficulty, mechanical shut
	downs, employee strikes, or any other unforeseeable acts that may delay or limit production, which could leave our commercial partners with inadequate supplies of product to sell, especially when regulatory requirements or customer demand
	necessitate the need for additional product supplies. Our inability to adequately establish, supervise and conduct (either ourselves or through third parties) all aspects of the formulation and manufacturing processes, and the inability of third

	appropriate use. The approved program covers all approved transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program and was implemented in March 2012. Additionally, the FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering the extended release and long acting
	opioid class. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA&#153; is anticipated to fall

	Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently
	uncertain. In order to conduct clinical trials that are necessary to obtain approval by the FDA to market a drug product, the FDA requires the submission of an IND. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND and, unless the FDA raises an issue or concern
	about the clinical trial plan during that time period, the IND becomes effective at the end of that 30 days and sponsors may proceed with their clinical trial plans. The FDA can suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time due to a number of
	factors, including for safety or efficacy reasons, because we or our clinical investigators did not comply with the FDA&#146;s requirements for conducting clinical trials, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of
	adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If the FDA does not permit us to proceed with our planned clinical trials or the trials are suspended or permanently terminated by us, the FDA or any institutional review boards overseeing the trials,
	the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the
	commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	addition, it is our stated intention to seek to avail ourselves of the FDA&#146;s 505(b)(2) approval procedure where it is appropriate to do so. Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act permits an applicant to file a NDA
	where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and the
	FDA&#146;s findings of safety and effectiveness based on certain preclinical testing or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from
	the approved product. If this approval pathway is not available to us with respect to a particular formulation or product, or at all, the time and cost associated with developing and commercializing such formulations or products may be prohibitive
	and our business strategy would be materially and adversely affected. For example, in September 2012, the FDA received a Citizen Petition requesting that it refuse to file any Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA or abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA,
	for buprenorphine/naloxone drugs intended to be applied to the oral mucosal membranes unless such application refers to the sublingual film formulation of Suboxone
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	, rather than the tablet
	formulation, as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Our proposed Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) marketing application for BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	is expected to reference the tablet formulation of Suboxone
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	rather than the film formulation as the reference listed drug, and the data we have generated has been based off of the tablet formulation of
	Suboxone
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	. While the FDA, on February&nbsp;22, 2013, rejected the Citizen Petition referred to above, we may be faced with similar issues in the future which might require us to conduct
	additional studies of our product candidates or otherwise face delays and additional costs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, we may be required to conduct
	additional costly and time-consuming clinical studies beyond those that we originally anticipate in the event that our clinical trials fail to meet their primary endpoints or for other reasons, which would render them inadequate to support approval

	Data already obtained, or data we may obtain in the

	interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those involved in competing drug delivery technologies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical
	trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a proposed formulation or product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the product candidate,
	resulting in delays to commercialization, and could materially harm our business. In addition, our clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our drugs, and
	thus our proposed drugs may not be approved for marketing. Finally, if any of our clinical trials do not meet their primary endpoints, or for a variety of other reasons, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials in order to progress
	development of the subject product. These additional trials would be costly and time-consuming, and would divert resources from other projects.

	With respect to our drug

	Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory
	proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of such proposals and related laws, rules and regulations could materially harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations or stock price. Moreover, the passage of the Patient

	Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (or the Reconciliation Act), which contains a number of amendments to the PPACA, was signed into law on March&nbsp;30, 2010. Two primary goals of the PPACA, combined with the Reconciliation Act (which we
	collectively refer to as the Health Reform Legislation), are to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. On June&nbsp;28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of

	The Healthcare Reform Legislation contains a number

	and control. The impact of these programs on our business is presently uncertain and may have unexpected consequences for our company. For example, expansion of health insurance coverage under the Health Reform Legislation may result in a reduction
	in uninsured patients and increase in the number of patients with access to healthcare that have either private or public program coverage, and subsequently prescription drug coverage, including coverage for those products currently approved or in
	development by us or our partners. However, this outcome, along with any other potential benefits of the Health Reform Legislation which could prove a benefit for us or our commercial partners, is uncertain and may not occur.

	expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes (including, without limitation, those enacted in connection with the federal or state implementation of the Health Reform Legislation) could impose limitations on the prices we or
	our commercial partners will be able to charge for any of our approved products or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or third-party payors, or may increase the tax obligations on life sciences

	In November&nbsp;2011, the USPTO rejected all 191 claims of MonoSol&#146;s &#146;588 Patent. On January&nbsp;20, 2012, we filed requests for
	reexamination before the USPTO of MonoSol&#146;s US patent No 7,357,891 (the &#146;891 Patent), and No 7,425,292 (the &#146;292 Patent), the two additional patents asserted by MonoSol, demonstrating that all claims of those two patents were
	anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art references, including prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and thus invalid. The USPTO granted the requests for reexamination with respect to MonoSol&#146;s &#146;292 and
	&#146;891 Patents. In its initial office action in each, the USPTO rejected every claim in each patent.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As expected, in the &#146;891
	Patent and &#146;292 Patent Ex Parte Reexamination proceedings, MonoSol amended the claims several times and made multiple declarations and arguments in an attempt to overcome the rejections made by the USPTO. These amendments, declarations and
	other statements regarding the claim language significantly narrowed the scope of their claims in these two patents. In the case of the &#146;891 Patent, not one of the original claims survived reexamination and five separate amendments were filed
	confirming our position that the patent was invalid. Additionally, we believe that arguments and admissions made by MonoSol prevent it from seeking a broader construction during any subsequent litigation by employing arguments or taking positions
	that contradict those made during prosecution.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A Reexamination Certificate for MonoSol&#146;s &#146;891 Patent in its amended form was
	issued August&nbsp;21, 2012 (Reexamined Patent No.&nbsp;7,357,891C1 or the &#146;891C1 Patent). A Reexamination Certificate for MonoSol&#146;s &#146;292 Patent in its amended form was issued on July&nbsp;3, 2012 (Reexamined Patent
	No.&nbsp;7,425,292C1 or the &#146;292C1 Patent). These actions by the USPTO confirm the invalidity of the original patents and through the narrowing of the claims in the reissued patents strengthens our original assertion that our products and
	technologies do not infringe on MonoSol&#146;s original patents.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On June&nbsp;12, 2013, despite our previously noted success in the prior
	ex parte reexaminations for the &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents, we filed requests for
<I>
	inter partes
</I>
	reviews (or IPR) on the narrowed yet reexamined patents, the &#146;292 C1 and &#146;891 C1 Patents, to challenge their validity and continue
	to strengthen our position. On November&nbsp;13, 2013, the USPTO decided not to institute the two inter partes reviews for the &#146;891 C1 and &#146;292 C1 Patents. The USPTO&#146;s decision was purely on statutory grounds and based on a
	technicality (in that the IPRs were not filed within what the UPSTO determined to be the statutory period) rather than substantive grounds. Thus, even though the inter partes reviews were not instituted, the USPTO decision preserves our right to
	raise the same arguments at a later time (e.g., during litigation). Regardless, our assertion that our products and technologies do not infringe the original &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents and, now, the reexamined &#146;891 C1 and &#146;292 C1
	Patents remains the same.

	Importantly, in the case of MonoSol&#146;s &#146;588 Patent, at the conclusion of the reexamination proceedings
	(and its appeals process), on April&nbsp;17, 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) issued a Decision on Appeal affirming the Examiner&#146;s rejection (and confirming the invalidity) of all the claims of the &#146;588 Patent. MonoSol did
	not request a rehearing by the May&nbsp;17, 2014 due date for making such a request and did not further appeal the Decision to the Federal Court of Appeals by the June&nbsp;17, 2014 due date for making such an appeal. Subsequently, on August&nbsp;5,
	2014, the USPTO issued a Certificate of Reexamination cancelling the &#145;588 Patent claims.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on our original assertion that our
	proprietary manufacturing process for ONSOLIS
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	does not infringe on patents held by MonoSol, and the denial and subsequent narrowing of the claims on the two reissued patents MonoSol has
	asserted against us while the third has had all claims rejected by the USPTO, we remain very confident in our original stated position regarding this matter. Thus far, we have proven that the &#147;original&#148; &#146;292 and &#146;891 patents in
	light of their reissuance with fewer and narrower claims were indeed invalid and the third and final patent, the &#146;588 patent, was invalid as well with all its claims cancelled. Given the outcomes of the &#145;292, &#145;891 and &#145;588
	reexamination proceedings, at a January&nbsp;22, 2015 status meeting, the Court decided to lift the stay and grant our request for the case to proceed on an expedited basis with a Motion for Summary Judgment to dismiss the action. On
	September&nbsp;25, 2015, the Honorable Freda L. Wolfson granted our motion for summary judgment and ordered the case closed. We were found to be entitled to absolute intervening rights as to both patents in suit, the &#145;292 and &#145;891 patents
	and our ONSOLIS
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	product is not liable for infringing the patents prior to July&nbsp;3, 2012 and August&nbsp;21, 2012, respectively. In October 2015, MonoSol appealed the decision of the court
	to the Federal Circuit. We have no reason to believe the outcome will be different and will vigorously defend the appeal. MonoSol filed an appeal with the Federal Circuit and has subsequently decided to withdraw the appeal.&nbsp;On February&nbsp;25,
	2016, MonoSol filed an Unopposed Motion For Voluntary Dismissal Of Appeal, which was granted by the court on February&nbsp;26, 2016 and the case dismissed.&nbsp;Thus, the district court&#146;s grant of the Summary Judgement of Intervening Rights
	will stand. In addition, the possibility exists, however, that MonoSol could file another suit alleging infringement of the &#145;292 and &#146;891 patents. We believe ONSOLIS

	On
	October&nbsp;29, 2013, Reckitt Benckiser, Inc., RB Pharmaceuticals Limited, and MonoSol (collectively, the RB Plaintiffs) filed an action against us relating to our BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for alleged patent infringement. BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	is a drug approved for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. The RB
	Plaintiffs claim that the formulation for BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	, which has never been disclosed publicly, infringes its patent (United States Patent No.&nbsp;8,475,832) (the &#146;832 Patent).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On May&nbsp;21, 2014, the Court granted our motion to dismiss. In doing so, the Court dismissed the case in its entirety. The RB Plaintiffs
	did not appeal the Court Decision by the June&nbsp;21, 2014 due date and therefore, the dismissal will stand and the RB Plaintiffs lose the ability to challenge the Court Decision in the future. The possibility exists, however, that the RB
	Plaintiffs could file another suit alleging infringement of the &#145;832 Patent. If this occurs, based on our original position that our BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	product does not infringe the &#145;832
	Patent, we would defend the case vigorously (as we have done so previously), and we anticipate that such claims against us ultimately would be rejected.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On September&nbsp;20, 2014, based upon our position and belief that our BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	product does not infringe any patents owned by the RB Plaintiffs, we proactively filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North (EDNC) Carolina, requesting the Court to make a determination
	that our BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	product does not infringe the RB Plaintiffs&#146; &#145;832 Patent, US Patent No.&nbsp;7,897,080 (&#145;080 Patent) and US Patent No.&nbsp;8,652,378 (&#145;378 Patent). With
	the declaratory judgment, there is an automatic stay in proceedings. The RB Plaintiffs may request that the stay be lifted, but they have the burden of showing that the stay should be lifted. For the &#145;832 Patent, the January&nbsp;15, 2014 IPR
	was instituted and in June 2015, all challenged claims were rejected for both anticipation and obviousness. In August 2015, the RB Plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Federal Circuit. We will vigorously defend this appeal at the Federal Circuit. For
	the &#145;080 Patent, all claims have been rejected in an inter partes reexamination and the rejection of all claims as invalid over the prior art has been affirmed on appeal by the PTAB in a decision dated March&nbsp;27, 2015. In May 2015, the RB
	Plaintiffs filed a response after the decision to which we filed comments. In December 2015 the Board denied MonoSol&#146;s request to reopen prosecution, but provided MonoSol an opportunity to file a corrected response. MonoSol filed the request in
	December 2015 and we subsequently filed comments on December&nbsp;23, 2015. We are awaiting a further decision from the Board, which we have no reason to believe will be inconsistent with the original decision rendered in March 2015. For the
	&#145;378 Patent, an IPR was filed on June&nbsp;1, 2014, but an IPR was not instituted. However, in issuing its November&nbsp;5, 2014 decision not to institute the IPR, the PTAB construed the claims of the &#145;378 Patent narrowly. As in prior
	litigation proceedings, we believe these IPR and the reexamination filings will provide support for maintaining the stay until the IPR and reexamination proceedings conclude. Indeed, given the PTAB&#146;s narrow construction of the claims of the
	&#145;378 Patent, we filed a motion to withdraw the &#145;378 Patent from the case on December&nbsp;12, 2014. In addition, we also filed a joint motion to continue the stay (with RB Plaintiffs) in the proceedings on the same day. Both the motion to
	withdraw the &#145;378 Patent from the proceedings and motion to continue the stay were granted.

	, whose formulation and manufacturing processes have never been disclosed publicly, infringes its patent U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;8,765,167

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	.
	We strongly refute as without merit the RB Plaintiffs&#146; assertion of patent infringement and will vigorously defend the lawsuit. On December&nbsp;12, 2014, we filed a motion to transfer the case from New Jersey to North Carolina and a motion to

	In a related matter, on October&nbsp;28, 2014, we filed multiple IPR requests on the &#146;167 Patent
	demonstrating that certain claims of such patent were anticipated by or obvious in light of prior art references, including prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and thus, invalid. The USPTO instituted three of the four IPR
	requests and we filed a request for rehearing for the non-instituted IPR. A final decision on the instituted &#145;167 IPRs is expected in May 2016.

	On January&nbsp;22, 2014, MonoSol filed a Petition for IPR on US Patent No.&nbsp;7,579,019 (the &#145;019 Patent). The Petition asserted that
	the claims of the &#145;019 Patent are alleged to be unpatentable over certain prior art references. The IPR was instituted on August&nbsp;6, 2014.&nbsp;An oral hearing was held in April 2015 and a decision upholding all seven claims was issued
	August&nbsp;5, 2015. In September 2015, MonoSol requested that the USPTO rehear the IPR. We will continue to vigorously defend our &#145;019 patent. We expect the USPTO to issue a decision in the first half of 2016.

	Paragraph IV certification relates to an Abbreviated New Drug Application (the &#147;ANDA&#148;) filed by Actavis with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) for a generic
	formulation of BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	. The Patents subject to Acatvis&#146; certification are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,579,019 (&#147;the &#146;019 Patent&#148;), 8,147,866 and 8,703,177.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that Actavis&#146; claims of invalidity of the Patents are wholly without merit and, as we have done in the past, we intend to
	vigorously defend our intellectual property. We are highly confident that the Patents are valid, as evidenced in part by the fact that the &#145;019 Patent has already been the subject of an unrelated IPR before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
	(the &#147;USPTO&#148;) under which we prevailed and all claims of the &#145;019 Patent survived. Although there is a pending request for rehearing of the final IPR decision regarding the &#145;019 Patent pending at the USPTO, we believe the
	USPTO&#146;s decision will be upheld. Under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended (the &#147;Hatch-Waxman Amendments&#148;), after receipt of a valid Paragraph IV
	notice, we may, and in this case plan to, bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against Actavis within 45 days from the date of receipt of the certification notice. If such a suit is commenced within this 45 day period, we are
	entitled to receive a 30 month stay on FDA&#146;s ability to give final approval to any proposed products that reference BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	. The 30 month stay is expected to preempt any final approval
	by FDA on Actavis&#146; ANDA until at least August of 2018. In addition, given the FDA approval of BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	, we are entitled to three years of market exclusivity for BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	ending in June 2017. Given this timeframe, Actavis&#146; action is not unexpected. In addition, we have additional pending intellectual property which, if issued, would be capable of extending
	the patent life of all three of our BEMA

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We were incorporated in the State of Indiana in 1997 and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation and conducted our initial public
	offering in 2002. In August 2004, we acquired Arius Pharmaceuticals, the then licensee (and now owner) of our BEMA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	drug delivery technology, and July 2006, we licensed commercialization
	rights in Europe for our lead product; BEMA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	based ONSOLIS
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	Development Agreement with Meda for ONSOLIS
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In January 2012, we entered into a definitive License and Development Agreement with Endo for BELBUCA
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&#153;

	for chronic pain and in December 2014, we and Endo filed the NDA submission for FDA approval for BELBUCA&#153;, which was accepted February 2015 and later approved by the FDA on October&nbsp;23,
	2015 and commercially launched by Endo in February 2016. In March&nbsp;2013, we entered into a definitive Exclusive License Agreement with Arcion pursuant to which Arcion agreed to grant to us an exclusive commercial world-wide license, with rights
	of sublicense, under certain patent and other intellectual property rights related to in-process research and development to develop, manufacture, market, and sell gel products containing clonidine (or a derivative thereof), alone or in combination
	with other active ingredients, for topical administration for the treatment of PDN and other indications. On July&nbsp;31, 2013, we submitted the NDA for BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	to the FDA for review, and

</SUP>
	for use in patients with chronic pain severe enough to require daily,

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&#153;
</SUP>
	has triggered a milestone payment to us from Endo of $50 million
	pursuant to the Endo Agreement, less approximately $6 million of cumulative pre-payments received. The aforementioned $20 million is contingently refundable to Endo based on a third party generic introduction in the U.S. during the patent extension
	period from 2020 to 2027. Should such introduction occur any time during the 2020 to 2027 period, a refund would be due to Endo based on the number of complete calendar months beyond December 31, 2019 where the first generic was sold over the
	denominator of 84 months times $20 million. For example, if a generic product were to be introduced in the U.S. in January of 2026, that would mean that 72 of the 84 months of patent exclusivity would have been earned and 12 months would have to be
	refunded. The calculation would be 12/84, multiplied by $20 million, or a refund of $2.9 million. The method of the refund payment to Endo would be accomplished first by crediting against milestone payments, second by reducing the royalty by 50%
	until the $2.9 million is paid back, and third by BDSI making a payment in the amount due to Endo. Otherwise, the $20 million will be earned as revenue each month over the patent extension period from 2020 to 2027.

	In accordance with
	Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (referred to herein as GAAP), goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level annually, or more frequently if indicated by events or conditions. We performed an evaluation and determined
	that there is only one reporting unit. In the course of the evaluation of the potential impairment of goodwill, either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment may be performed. If a qualitative evaluation determines that no impairment exists,
	then no further analysis is performed. If a qualitative evaluation is unable to determine whether impairment has occurred, a quantitative evaluation is performed. The quantitative impairment test first identifies potential impairments by comparing
	the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated and an impairment
	is recorded if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount. The determination of goodwill impairment is highly subjective. It considers many factors both internal and external and is subject to significant changes from period to period.
	No goodwill impairment charges have resulted from this analysis for 2015, 2014 or 2013.

	An impairment of a long-lived asset other than

	We determined that, upon inception of both the U.S. and EU Meda arrangements, all deliverables were considered one combined unit of
	accounting. As such, all cash payments from Meda that were related to these deliverables were initially recorded as deferred revenue.&nbsp;Upon commencement of the license term (date of first commercial sale in each territory), the license and
	certain deliverables associated with research and development services were delivered to Meda. The first commercial sale in the U.S. occurred in October 2009. As a result, $59.7 million of the aggregate milestones and services revenue was recognized
	as revenue in fiscal year 2009. In connection with the return of the U.S. marketing authorization by Meda to us in January 2015, the remaining U.S.-related deferred revenue of $1.0 million was recorded as contract revenue during the year ended

	have obtained third-party evidence of fair value of the product supply deliverable based on the outsourced contract manufacturing cost charged to us from the third-party supplier of the product. The arrangements do not contain any general rights of

	intellectual property component was considered a separate deliverable, no distinct amount of the up-front payment was assigned to this deliverable because we determined the deliverable to be perfunctory. The amount allocated to the license was
	recognized as revenue in fiscal year 2012. The portion of the upfront license fee allocated to the clinical development services deliverable of $14.4 million is being recognized as those services are performed.&nbsp;We estimated that such clinical
	development services would extend into the first half of 2015.&nbsp;Such services were completed by March 2015 and resulted in the recognition of $0.4 million, $2.5 million and $6.3 million as contract revenue in fiscal years, 2015, 2014 and 2013,
	respectively.

	Clonidine Topical Gel.
</I>
	Prior to license of Clonidine Topical Gel to us, Arcion assessed its effectiveness in reducing pain associated
	with PDN in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study where the primary study endpoint was the change in pain intensity over a 3 month treatment period in diabetic foot pain. A significant treatment difference was seen in the planned subset
	analysis of diabetic patients who had documented evidence of &#147;functioning pain receptors&#148; in the skin of the lower leg (p=0.01, n=63) thus, at a minimum, supporting the effectiveness of topical clonidine in diabetic patients with
	functioning pain receptors of the skin. In the overall population that included patients without &#147;functioning nerve receptors&#148;, there was a trend favoring Clonidine Topical Gel (p=0.07, n=182), though the overall results did not reach
	statistical significance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A Phase 3 clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of Clonidine Topical Gel in the enriched population
	identified in the Phase 2 study performed by Arcion was started in 2014. An interim analysis in the summer indicated that a sample size increase was needed to maintain 90% power to demonstrate a statistical difference between clonidine and placebo.
	Randomization of the final subject at the revised sample size was completed in December. In March 2015, we announced that the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 3 study of Clonidine Topical Gel compared to placebo did not meet statistical
	significance, although certain secondary endpoints showed statistically significant improvement over placebo. Final analysis of the study identified a sizeable patient population with a statistically significant improvement (n=158; p&lt;0.02) in
	pain score vs placebo. Following thorough analysis of the data and identification of the reasons behind the study results, we initiated a second study. The study incorporates significant learnings from previously conducted studies and involves
	tightened and additional inclusion criteria to improve assay sensitivity, reduce bias and ensure compliance with enrollment criteria. The final study subject is expected to complete treatment by the end of 2016. The risks to our company associated
	with the Clonidine Topical Gel clinical program include: (i)&nbsp;inability to develop and manufacture a stable formulation suitable for commercial use; (ii)&nbsp;failure of clinical trials; (iii)&nbsp;product safety issues; (iv)&nbsp;failure of or
	delay by the FDA to approve our NDA; (v)&nbsp;failure of a commercial partner or us to effectively launch and sell the product; and (vii)&nbsp;lack of funding to advance the program.

	In 2014, we entered into an agreement with Evonik to
	develop and commercialize a long-acting buprenorphine depot injection capable of providing 30 days of continuous buprenorphine blood concentrations following a single monthly injection. In 2015, we completed initial development work and preclinical

	compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December&nbsp;31, 2015. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the
	Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (COSO). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at December&nbsp;31,

	accordance with such committee&#146;s charter and practice. In March 2012, the Compensation Committee of our board (with input from our outside compensation consultant) determined and approved that Dr.&nbsp;O&#146;Donnell would receive compensation
	at a level equal to 50% of the President/CEO&#146;s salary, cash bonus and options. The salary portion would begin on January&nbsp;1, 2012 and the cash bonus and option portion would be determined in the first quarter of 2013, when, under normal
	circumstances, the company 2012 objectives would be evaluated. Because of the change in his compensation, Dr.&nbsp;O&#146;Donnell will no longer receive cash retainers or option awards under the existing board of director remuneration program for
	his role as a member of our board of directors.

	compatibility with current board members, industry reputation, knowledge of our company generally, independence and ethnic and gender diversity. While diversity is considered as a board qualification criteria, it would not be weighted any more or

	In addition, we strive to be competitive with other similarly situated companies in our industry. The process of developing pharmaceutical
	products and bringing those products to market is a long-term proposition and outcomes may not be measurable for several years. Therefore, in order to build long-term value for us and our stockholders, and in order to achieve our business

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our company-wide compensation program, including for our NEOs, is broken down into three main components: base salary, performance cash bonuses
	and potential long-term compensation in the form of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs). We believe these three components constitute the minimum essential elements of a competitive compensation package in our industry. We also have a
	Performance Long Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to herein as the LTIP) for our NEOs and selected senior officers of ours, which compensates such employees with RSUs based on our achievement of certain pre-determined revenue performance goals.

	Salary
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Base salary
	is used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of our NEOs as well as recognizing the competitive nature of the biopharmaceutical industry. This is determined partially by evaluating our peer companies as well
	as the degree of responsibility and experience levels of our NEOs and their overall contributions to our company. Base salary is one component of the compensation package for NEOs; the other components being cash bonuses, annual equity grants,
	a&nbsp;long-term incentive plan and our benefit programs. Base salary is determined in advance whereas the other components of compensation are awarded in varying degrees following an assessment of the performance of a NEO.&nbsp;This approach to
	compensation reflects the philosophy of our board of directors and its Compensation Committee to emphasize and reward, on an annual basis, performance levels achieved by our NEOs.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have a performance cash bonus plan under which bonuses are paid to our NEOs based on achievement of our performance goals and objectives
	established by the Compensation Committee and/or our board of directors as well as on individual performance. The bonus program is discretionary and is intended to: (i)&nbsp;strengthen the connection between individual compensation and our
	achievements; (ii)&nbsp;encourage teamwork among all disciplines within our company; (iii)&nbsp;reinforce our pay-for-performance philosophy by awarding higher bonuses to higher performing employees; and (iv)&nbsp;help ensure that our cash
	compensation is competitive. Depending on the cash position of ours, the Compensation Committee and our board of directors have the discretion after consulting with our CEO to not pay cash bonuses in order that we may conserve cash and support
	ongoing development programs and commercialization efforts. Regardless of our cash position, we consistently grant annual merit-based stock options (and, more recently in the case of senior executives, RSUs) to continue incentivizing both our senior
	management and our employees.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on their employment agreements, each NEO is assigned a target payout under the performance cash bonus
	plan, expressed as a percentage of base salary for the year. Actual payouts under the performance cash bonus plan are based on the achievement of corporate performance goals and an assessment of individual performance, each of which is separately
	weighted as a component of such officer&#146;s target payout. For the NEOs, the corporate goals receive the highest weighting in order to ensure that the bonus system for our management team is closely tied to our corporate performance. Each
	employee also has specific individual goals and objectives as well that are tied to the overall corporate goals. For employees, mid-year and end-of-year progress is reviewed with the employees&#146; managers.

	Equity Incentive Compensation
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We view long-term compensation, currently in the form of stock options and RSUs, generally vesting in annual increments over three years (other
	than awards under our LTIP, which vest immediately if awarded), as a tool to align the interests of our NEOs and employees generally with the creation of stockholder value, to motivate our employees to achieve and exceed corporate and individual
	objectives and to encourage them to remain employed by us. While cash compensation is a significant component of employees&#146; overall compensation, the Compensation Committee and our board of directors (as well as our NEOs) believe that the
	driving force of any employee working in a small biotechnology company should be strong equity participation. We believe that this not only creates the potential for substantial longer term corporate value but also serves to motivate employees and
	retain their loyalty and commitment with appropriate personal compensation. The Compensation Committee believes that because stock options and RSUs have a three-year vesting schedule that begins one year after the date of the award, the equity
	grants constitute a significant retention incentive and a tool to foster continuity of management, an important factor in a company with a relatively low number of employees. Our equity awards are granted under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (as the
	same may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time, which we refer to herein as the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan)

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2012, in anticipation of the commencement of substantial revenue generation operations by means of product commercialization, the
	Compensation Committee approved our LTIP. The LTIP is designed as an incentive for our senior management (including our NEOs) to generate revenue for us.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The LTIP consists of RSUs (which, for purposes of our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, are defined as and considered (and which we refer to herein
	as) Performance RSUs), which are rights to acquire shares of our common stock. All Performance RSUs granted under the LTIP will be granted under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan as &#147;Performance Compensation Awards&#148; under such plan. The
	participants in the LTIP are either NEOs or senior officers of ours.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The term of the LTIP began with our fiscal year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2012 and lasts through our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2019. The total number of Performance RSUs covered by the LTIP is 1,078,000, of which an aggregate of 978,000 were awarded in 2012 (and an aggregate of 35,000 in 2015).
	The Performance RSUs under the LTIP did not vest upon granting, but instead are subject to potential vesting each year over the 8 year term of the LTIP depending on the achievement of revenue by us, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
	During 2013, 2014 and 2015, an aggregate of 8,986, 4,447 and 21,356 Performance RSUs vested, respectively. Performance RSUs will be valued on the day of issuance and will vest annually on the last day preceding the first open trading window after
	filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K based on the revenue achieved during the prior fiscal year as a proportion of the total cumulative revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP (which we call the Predefined Cumulative Revenue). Predefined
	Cumulative Revenue is a predefined aggregate revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP that was determined by the Compensation Committee in conjunction with our executive management. The Predefined Cumulative Revenue may be adjusted by the
	Compensation Committee upon the occurrence of extraordinary corporate events during the term of the LTIP (such as acquisitions by us of revenue generating businesses or assets).

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	addition to the main components of compensation outlined above, we also provide contractual severance and/or change in control benefits to the NEOs as well as Dr.&nbsp;Niraj Vasisht, our Senior Vice President&#151;Product Development and Chief
	Technology Officer (who was promoted to NEO status as of January&nbsp;1, 2016), to Albert J. Medwar, our Vice President, Corporate and Business Development, to Stephana Patton, our Vice President and General Counsel, to Scott Plesha, our Senior Vice
	President of Sales, to Enoch Bortey, Ph.D., our Vice President Clinical Biostatistics and Data Systems, and to Joseph Lockhart, our Vice President Manufacturing and Supply Chain. The change in control benefits for all applicable persons has a
	&#147;double trigger.&#148; A double-trigger means that the executive officers will receive the change in control benefits described in the agreements only if there is both (1)&nbsp;a Change in Control of our company (as defined in the agreements)
	and (2)&nbsp;a termination by us of the applicable person&#146;s employment &#147;without cause&#148; or a resignation by the applicable persons for &#147;good reason&#148; (as defined in the agreements) within a specified time period prior to or
	following the Change in Control. We believe this double trigger requirement creates the potential to maximize stockholder value because it prevents an unintended windfall to management as no benefits are triggered solely in the event of a Change in
	Control while providing appropriate incentives to act in furtherance of a change in control that may be in the best interests of the stockholders. We believe these severance or change in control benefits are important elements of our compensation
	program that assist us in retaining talented individuals at the executive and senior managerial levels and that these arrangements help to promote stability and continuity of our executives and senior management team. We also believe that the
	interests of our stockholders will be best served if the interests of these members of our management are aligned with theirs. Furthermore, we believe that providing change in control benefits lessens or eliminates any potential reluctance of
	members of our management to pursue potential change in control transactions that may be in the best interests of the stockholders. Finally, we believe that it is important to provide severance benefits to members of our management, to promote
	stability and to focus on the job at hand.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also provide benefits to the executive officers that are generally available to all regular
	full-time employees of ours, including our medical and dental insurance, life insurance and a 401(k) match for all individuals who participate in the 401(k) plan. At this time, we do not provide any perquisites to any of our NEOs. Further, we do not
	have deferred compensation plans, pension arrangements or post-retirement health coverage for our executive officers or employees. All of our employees not specifically under contract are &#147;at-will&#148; employees, which mean that their
	employment can be terminated at any time for any reason by either us or the employee. Our NEOs (as well as certain of our senior managers) have employment agreements that provide lump sum compensation in the event of their termination without cause
	or, under certain circumstances, upon a Change of Control.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A number of factors impact the determination of compensation amounts for our NEOs, including the individual&#146;s role in our company and
	individual performance, length of service with us, competition for talent, individual compensation package, assessments of internal pay equity and industry data. Stock price performance has generally not been a significant factor in determining
	annual compensation because the price of our common stock is subject to a variety of factors outside of our control.

	In collaboration with Radford, each year our Compensation Committee establishes a list of peer companies to best assure ourselves that we are
	compensating our executives on a fair and reasonable basis, as set forth above under the heading &#147;Objectives of our Compensation Program.&#148; We also utilize Radford-prepared data for below-executive level personnel, which data focuses on
	similarly-sized life science companies in the Southeastern region of the United States. The availability of peer data is used by the Compensation Committee strictly as a guide in determining compensation levels with regard to salaries, cash bonuses
	and performance related annual equity grants to all employees. However, the availability of this data does not imply that the Compensation Committee is under any obligation to exactly follow peer companies in compensation matters.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a guideline for NEO base salary, we perform formal benchmarks against respective comparable positions in our established peer group. Our
	guideline is to set targeted NEO salary ranges between the 25th and 50th percentile for comparable positions within our peer group. We then adjust salaries based on our assessment of our NEOs&#146; levels of responsibility, experience, overall
	compensation structure and individual performance. The Compensation Committee has the discretion if it believes circumstances warrant, to go above the 50th percentile of the peer group. The Compensation Committee is not obliged to raise salaries
	purely on the availability of data. Merit-based increases to salaries of executive officers are based on our assessment of individual performance and the relationship to applicable salary ranges. Cost of living adjustments may also be a part of that
	assessment. The Compensation Committee, in recent years, has tended to maintain cash compensation levels at or near the 50th percentile but to exceed that level in determining equity compensation. The emphasis on equity compensation reflects the
	Committee&#146;s objective, given that we are only presently engaging in revenue generating operations, to preserve cash in a prudent manner and yet reward personnel for outstanding performance.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Concurrently with the beginning of each calendar year, preliminary corporate goals that reflect our business priorities for the coming year are
	prepared by the CEO with input from the other NEOs as well as other officers. These goals are weighted by relative importance. The draft goals and proposed weightings are presented to the Compensation Committee and our full board in January of each
	year and discussed, revised as necessary, and then approved by our board of directors. The Compensation Committee then reviews the final goals and their weightings to determine and confirm their appropriateness for use as performance measurements
	for purposes of the bonus program. The goals and/or weightings may be re-visited during the year and potentially restated in the event of significant changes in corporate strategy or the occurrence of significant corporate events.&nbsp;Following the
	agreement of our board of directors on the corporate objectives, the goals are then shared with all employees in a formal meeting(s), and are reviewed periodically throughout the year at monthly staff meetings and quarterly board of director
	meetings.

	The performance cash bonus plan for our executive officers and employees in 2015 was adopted by the Compensation Committee in
	January 2015. The plan sets forth target bonus opportunities, as a percentage of salary, based on the level of responsibility of the position, ranging up to 60% of salary for our CEO, and up to 40% of salary for our NEOs and up to 30% of salary for
	certain other officers. In setting these percentages, the Compensation Committee determined that the above percentages were reasonable and in line with our peer group. Each employee has the opportunity to achieve up to 100% of his targeted amount,
	depending on how corporate goals and objectives are achieved, with variances on an &#147;employee by employee&#148; basis to be determined by our CEO in conjunction with the employees&#146; direct report as applicable.

	To assist us in assessing the reasonableness of our equity grant amounts, historically we have reviewed Radford supplied information and, prior
	to Radford, we used information supplied by Equilar. Such information included equity data from a cross-section of the companies in the above-mentioned surveys. Initial, on-hire stock option grant amounts have generally been targeted at the 25th to
	50th percentile for that position or similar industry position, adjusted for internal equity, experience level of the individual and the individual&#146;s total mix of compensation and benefits provided in his or her offer package. Initial on-hire
	grants typically vest over three years.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In granting equity awards in 2015 as well as prior years, the Compensation Committee utilized a
	methodology that computed the financial value of the equity granted, applying as a general guideline, a peer group percentile ranging from the 50th to the 75th percentile. The Committee, in determining annual equity awards in early 2015 utilized a
	methodology based upon Radford supplied peer group data, that computes the number of RSUs granted as a percentage of outstanding common stock, generally referencing the 75th percentile. The Committee believed that the change in methodology was
	appropriate because of the changing characterization of ours from one whose operations were primarily the development of therapeutic prescription drugs to one whose operations included revenue generation through the marketing and sale of
	FDA-approved drugs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	All stock options and/or RSUs granted to the NEOs and other executives are approved by the Compensation Committee. Exercise prices for options
	are set using a 30-day volume weighted average price method, which we define as the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the trading day of the date of grant and the 30&nbsp;trading days preceding that date. RSU grants
	are valued on the day of issuance and are vested on the last day preceding an open window after filing our annual report for equity trading. These RSU&#146;s will vest annually in one-third increments on the last day preceding an open window after
	filing our annual report for equity trading for our employees. Grants are generally made: (i)&nbsp;on the employee&#146;s start date and (ii)&nbsp;at board of director meetings held each January and following annual performance reviews. However,
	grants have been made at other times during the year. The size of year-end grants for each NEO is assessed against our internal equity guidelines. Current market conditions for grants for comparable positions and internal equity may also be
	assessed. Also, grants may be made in connection with promotions or job related changes in responsibilities. In addition, on occasion, the Compensation Committee may make special awards for extraordinary individual or our company performance and, as
	was the case in early 2015, of achievement over an extended period of time.

	Compensation Setting Process
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the January meetings of our board of directors and the Compensation Committee, overall corporate performance and relative achievement of the
	corporate goals for the prior year are assessed. The relative achievement of each goal is assessed and quantified and the summation of the individual components results in a corporate goal rating, expressed as percentages. The Compensation Committee
	then approves the final disbursement of salary increases, cash bonuses and option or RSU grants, giving an 80% weight factor to the corporate goal rating, and a 20% weight factor for such other performance criteria the Committee may in its
	discretion deem relevant at the time of the granting awards.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Also near the end of the year, the CEO evaluates the individual performance
	of each NEO (other than himself) and provides the Compensation Committee with an assessment of the performance of such NEO. In determining the individual performance ratings of the NEOs, we assess performance against a number of factors, including
	each NEO&#146;s relative contributions to our corporate goals, demonstrated career growth, level of performance in the face of available resources and other challenges, and the respective officer&#146;s department&#146;s overall performance. This
	assessment is conducted in a holistic fashion, in contrast to the summation of individual components as is done to arrive at the corporate goal rating.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Following a qualitative assessment of individual NEO&#146;s performance, our policies provide guidelines for translating this performance
	assessment into a numerical rating. Both the initial qualitative assessment and the translation into a numerical rating are made by the Compensation Committee on a discretionary basis. We believe that conducting a discretionary assessment for the
	individual component of the NEOs&#146; performance provides for flexibility in the evaluation of our NEOs and their adaptability to addressing potential changes in our priorities throughout the year.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Compensation Committee looks to the CEO&#146;s performance assessments of the other NEOs and his recommendations regarding a performance
	rating for each, as well as input from the other members of our board of directors. These recommendations may be adjusted by the Compensation Committee prior to finalization. For the CEO, the Compensation Committee evaluates his performance, taking
	into consideration input from the other members of our board of directors, and considers the achievement of overall corporate objectives by both the CEO specifically and our company generally. The CEO is not present during the Compensation
	Committee&#146;s deliberations regarding his compensation.

	With respect to BUNAVAIL
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	head of sales at Salix Pharmaceuticals. We also internalized the managed care function by the hiring of Mike Bullock, also former head of that function at Salix Pharmaceuticals. As a result of some of these changes, in the second half of the year,

	as well as revenue growth. Nevertheless, senior management and the board of directors initiated, in late 2015,
	a thorough evaluation of our marketing and sales strategies for BUNAVAIL

	importance to his performance as CEO, the Compensation Committee determined that Dr.&nbsp;Sirgo performed at a relatively high level, most notably:(1) acquiring executive level personnel to support the changing nature of our operations and to
	compensate for the retirement of Dr.&nbsp;Finn; (2)&nbsp;acting expeditiously to address a slower and more challenging launch of BUNAVAIL

	In connection with this

	Retirement Agreement Dr.&nbsp;Finn was entitled to receive (i)&nbsp;a $375,000 retirement bonus, payable quarterly in advance following his retirement, (ii)&nbsp;a customary cash bonus for services rendered by Dr.&nbsp;Finn during 2015 and
	(iii)&nbsp;a customary equity bonus for services rendered by Dr.&nbsp;Finn during 2015, to be determined in accordance with our prevailing compensation policies and procedures. In addition: (i)&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Finn will be allowed to retain all of his
	fully vested options to purchase shares of our common stock received under our equity incentive plans for the remaining life of such options, so long as such options have fully vested on or before the Retirement Date, and (ii)&nbsp;all unvested
	restricted stock units previously issued under our equity incentive plans and held by Dr.&nbsp;Finn as of the Retirement Date were cancelled and, in lieu thereof, Dr.&nbsp;Finn was awarded a one-time issuance of shares of our common stock based upon
	a net present valuation of the cancelled restricted stock units as set forth in the Retirement Agreement (which resulted in an issuance of 513,221 shares of common stock). The Compensation Committee and our board of directors approved the Retirement
	Agreement in recognition of Dr.&nbsp;Finn&#146;s many years of outstanding contributions, particularly in his management of our drug development activities.

	Beginning for our fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2014, we began to take into account
	the limitations on the deductibility of base salary or bonus amounts as required under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code since the aggregate salary and bonus payments for certain of our NEOS were above the $1,000,000 deductibility

	Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended generally changes the tax rules that affect most

	the extension of the post-termination exercise periods of stock options. We take Code Section&nbsp;409A into account, where applicable, in determining the timing of compensation paid to our executive officers.

	limit our ability to take a tax deduction for certain &#147;excess parachute payments&#148; (as defined in Code Sections 280G and 4999) and impose excise taxes on each NEO who receives &#147;excess parachute payments&#148; in connection with his or
	her severance from us in connection with a change in control. We consider the adverse tax liabilities imposed by Code Sections 280G and 4999, as well as other competitive factors, when structuring post-termination compensation payable to our
	executive officers and generally provide a mechanism for a &#147;better after tax&#148; result for the NEO, which we believe is a reasonable balance between our interests, on the one hand, and the executive&#146;s compensation on the other.

	In connection with this development, on December&nbsp;16, 2015, we and Dr.&nbsp;Finn entered into a Retirement Agreement
	(the &#147;Agreement&#148;) setting forth the mutual understandings of us and Dr.&nbsp;Finn regarding his retirement from our company. Along with containing customary terms and conditions, under the Agreement, Dr.&nbsp;Finn received or will receive
	(i)&nbsp;a $375,000 retirement bonus, payable quarterly in advance following his retirement, (ii)&nbsp;a customary cash bonus for services rendered by Dr.&nbsp;Finn during 2015, which was determined in accordance with our prevailing compensation
	policies and procedures and (iii)&nbsp;a customary equity bonus for services rendered by Dr.&nbsp;Finn during 2015, which was determined in accordance with our prevailing compensation policies and procedures. In addition: (i)&nbsp;Dr. Finn will be
	allowed to retain all of his fully vested options to purchase our common stock received under our equity incentive plans for the remaining life of such options, so long as such options have fully vested on or before the Retirement Date, and
	(ii)&nbsp;all unvested restricted stock units previously issued under our equity incentive plans and held by Dr.&nbsp;Finn as of the Retirement Date will be cancelled and, in lieu thereof, Dr.&nbsp;Finn will be awarded a one-time issuance of our
	common stock based upon a net present valuation of the cancelled restricted stock units as set forth in the Retirement Agreement. Pursuant to the cancellation of Dr.&nbsp;Finn&#146;s unvested RSUs, in January 2016 we issued to Dr.&nbsp;Finn 513,221
	shares of our common stock.

	Niraj Vasisht, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer
</I>
	- Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht&#146;s
	current employment agreement, dated October&nbsp;1, 2008, as amended, is subject to successive, automatic one-year extensions unless either party gives notice of non-extension to the other party at least 30 days prior to the end of the applicable
	term. The agreement includes a base salary, target bonus of up to 40% of his base salary (which was subject to modification with the approval of our Compensation Committee and is now 50%), and other employee benefits. Under the terms of his
	agreement, Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht received base salary in 2015 of $310,000 per year and a bonus of $57,400, which related to 2014 performance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We may terminate Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht&#146;s employment agreement without cause and Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht may resign upon 30 days advance written
	notice. We may immediately terminate Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht&#146;s employment agreement for Good Cause (as defined in the agreement). Upon the termination of Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht &#146;s employment for any reason, Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht will continue to receive
	payment of any base salary earned but unpaid through the date of termination and any other payment or benefit to which he is entitled under the applicable terms of any applicable company arrangements. If Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht is terminated during the
	term of the employment agreement other than for Good Cause (as defined in the employment agreement), or if Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined in the employment agreement), Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht is entitled to a lump
	sum severance payment equal to 1 times the sum of his annual base salary plus a pro-rata annual bonus based on his target annual bonus. In the event that such termination is within six months following a Change of Control (as defined in the
	employment agreement), the lump sum paid to Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht will equal the sum of his then current annual base salary
<U>
	plus
</U>
	an amount equal to fifty percent (50%)&nbsp;of his then current annual base salary, multiplied by 1.5. In addition,
	Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht&#146;s employment agreement will terminate prior to its scheduled expiration date in the event of Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht&#146;s death or disability.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Dr.&nbsp;Vasisht&#146;s employment agreement also includes a 2 year non-competition and non-solicitation and confidentiality covenants on
	terms identical to the existing employment agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, he is also entitled to the following benefits: medical, dental and disability and 401(k).

	Our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan was originally comprised of 4,200,000 shares of our common stock. The purpose of
	the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan is: (i)&nbsp;to align our interests and recipients of options under the plan by increasing the proprietary interest of such recipients in our growth and success, and (ii)&nbsp;to advance our interests by providing
	additional incentives to officers, key employees and well-qualified non-employee directors and consultants who provide services to us, who are responsible for our management and growth, or otherwise contribute to the conduct and direction of our
	business, operations and affairs. The Compensation Committee of our board of directors administers our incentive plan, selects the persons to whom options are granted and fixes the terms of such options. In July 2013, 2014 and 2015, our stockholders
	approved increases to our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan in the amounts of 2,600,000, 2,000,000 and 2,250,000, respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Options may be
	awarded during the ten-year term of the plan to our employees (including employees who are directors), or consultants who are not employees and our other affiliates. Our plan provides for the grant of options that qualify as incentive stock options,
	or Incentive Stock Options, under Section&nbsp;422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and options which are not Incentive Stock Options, or Non-Statutory Stock Options, as well as restricted stock and other awards. Only our employees
	or employees of our subsidiaries may be granted Incentive Stock Options. Our affiliates or consultants or others as may be permitted by our board of directors, may be granted Non-Statutory Stock Options.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Options to purchase 3,397,529 shares of our common stock at prices ranging from $1.38 to $16.57 are outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2015.
	There were no options granted during 2015 whose exercise price was lower than the estimated market price of the stock at the grant date.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Options issued during 2015 to employees and consultants under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan totaled 684,629 shares, at exercise prices
	ranging from $5.36 to $13.09. There were no options issued to directors and officers under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan during 2015 as we have migrated to the issuance of RSUs.

	In December 2012, by unanimous written consent following significant planning and discussion (as well as discussion with our outside

</P>

	The LTIP consists of RSUs (as defined under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan) which are rights to acquire shares of our common stock. All
	Performance RSUs granted under the LTIP will be granted under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (as the same may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time) as &#147;Performance Compensation Awards&#148; under such plan. The participants
	in the LTIP are either NEOs or senior officers of our company. Dr.&nbsp;Finn will also be entitled to participate in the 2015 LTIP award per his retirement agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The term of the LTIP began with our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and lasts through our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2019.
	The total number of Performance RSUs covered by the LTIP is 1,078,000, of which 978,000 were awarded in 2012 and 35,000 were awarded November 2015 (the remaining 195,198 Performance RSUs being reserved for future hires, which includes forfeitures).
	A total of 21,356, 4,447 and 8,986 RSUs vested during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Performance RSUs under the LTIP did not vest upon granting, but instead are subject to potential vesting each year over
	the 8 year term of the LTIP depending on the achievement of revenue by our company, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Performance RSUs will be valued on the day of issuance and will vest annually on the last day preceding the first open
	window after filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K based on the revenue achieved during the prior fiscal year as a proportion of the total cumulative revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP (which we call the Predefined Cumulative Revenue).
	Predefined Cumulative Revenue is a predefined aggregate revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP that was determined by the Committee in conjunction with our executive management. The Predefined Cumulative Revenue may be adjusted by the
	Committee upon the occurrence of extraordinary corporate events during the term of the LTIP (such as acquisitions by our company of revenue generating businesses or assets).

	The Audit Committee of our board of directors has established its pre-approval policies and procedures, pursuant to which the Audit Committee
	approved the foregoing audit and non-audit services provided by Cherry Bekaert LLP in 2015 and tax services from Romeo, Wiggins&nbsp;&amp; Company, LLP in 2015. Consistent with the Audit Committee&#146;s responsibility for engaging our independent

	Audit Committee to approve any audit-related services arising during the year that were not pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Any non-audit service must be approved by the full Audit Committee. Services approved by the Audit Committee chairperson
	are communicated to the full Audit Committee at its next regular meeting and the Audit Committee reviews services and fees for the fiscal year at each such meeting. Pursuant to these procedures, the Audit Committee approved the foregoing audit
	services provided by Cherry Bekaert LLP.

	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. We also have audited the
	Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
	The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
	Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item&nbsp;9A&#151;Controls and Procedures in the Company&#146;s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
	statements and an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
	whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
	statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
	understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
	included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
	reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
	(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
	necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
	of the Company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of

	The Company typically requires its customers to remit payments within the first 30 to 37 days, depending on the customer and the products
	purchased. In addition, the Company offers wholesale distributors a prompt payment discount if they make payments within these deadlines. This discount is generally 2%, but may be higher in some instances due to product launches or customer and/or
	industry expectations. Because the Company&#146;s wholesale distributors typically take the prompt payment discount, the Company accrues 100% of the prompt payment discounts, based on the gross amount of each invoice, at the time of sale, and the
	Company applies earned discounts at the time of payment. The allowance for prompt payment discounts was $0.05 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
	indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the course of the evaluation of the potential impairment of goodwill, either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment may be performed. If a qualitative evaluation determines that
	it&#146;s more likely that not that no impairment exists, then no further analysis is performed. If a qualitative evaluation is unable to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred, a quantitative evaluation is
	performed. The quantitative impairment analysis involves a two-step process. Step one involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates (the Company&#146;s enterprise value) to the carrying value of the
	reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company determines the implied fair value of goodwill and records an impairment charge for
	any excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

	received by its customers. The Company sells its products primarily to large national wholesalers, which have the right to return the products they purchase. The Company is required to reasonably estimate the amount of future returns at the time of
	revenue recognition. The Company recognizes product sales net of estimated allowances for rebates, price adjustments chargebacks and prompt payment discounts. When the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of future product returns, it
	defers revenues until the risk of product return has been substantially eliminated.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had
	$1.9 million and $0.8 million of deferred revenue related to sales to wholesalers for which future returns could not be reasonably estimated at the time of sale. Deferred revenue is recognized when the product is sold to the end user, based upon
	prescriptions filled. To estimate product sold to end users, the Company relies on third-party information, including prescription data and information obtained from significant distributors with respect to their inventory levels and sales to
	customers. Deferred revenue is recorded net of estimated allowances for rebates, price adjustments, chargebacks, prompt payment and other discounts. Estimated allowances are recorded and classified as accrued expenses in the accompanying balance
	sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 (Note 3).

	over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. In addition, option-based techniques were highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the Company&#146;s trading market price which was high-historical
	volatility. Since derivative financial instruments were initially and subsequently carried at fair values, the Company&#146;s operating results reflected the volatility in these estimates and assumption changes.

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, &#147;Revenue from
	Contracts with Customers,&#148; which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification

	(&#147;ASC&#148;) Topic 605, &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148; and most industry-specific guidance on revenue recognition throughout the ASC. The
	new standard is principles-based and provides a five step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized when a company transfers promised goods or services to
	customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also requires disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information surrounding the amount,
	nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to defer the effective date of the standard from January&nbsp;1, 2017 to January&nbsp;1, 2018, with an option that permits
	companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date. Early application prior to the original effective date is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The
	Company is evaluating the effect that ASU&nbsp;2014-09&nbsp;will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its
	ongoing financial reporting.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, &#147;Interest - Imputation of Interest&#148;. The issuance of
	ASU 2015-03 is part of the FASB&#146;s initiative to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. Under the new guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability must be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
	from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amortization of such costs should continue to be calculated using the interest method and be reported as interest expense. The guidance is effective for the Company
	in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted the guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and reclassified debt issuance costs, of $0.8 million at December&nbsp;31, 2014, and expanded
	disclosure.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FASB&#146;s new leases standard ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) was issued on February&nbsp;25, 2016. ASU 2016-02 is
	intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment. The ASU will require organizations that lease
	assets referred to as &#147;Lessees&#148; to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements
	to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Under
	the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from
	a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new ASU will require both types of leases
	(i.e. operating and capital) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The FASB lessee accounting model will continue to account for both types of leases. The capital lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases are
	accounted for under existing GAAP. The operating lease will be accounted for in a manner similar to operating leases under existing GAAP, except that lessees will recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all of those leases. The leasing
	standard will be effective for calendar year-end public companies beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018.&nbsp;Public companies will be required to adopt the new leasing standard for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
	beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018. Early adoption will be permitted for all companies and organizations upon issuance of the standard. For calendar year-end public companies, this means an adoption date of January&nbsp;1, 2019 and retrospective
	application to previously issued annual and interim financial statements for 2018 and 2017. Lessees with a large portfolio of leases are likely to see a significant increase in balance sheet assets and liabilities. See Note 14 for the Company&#146;s
	current lease commitments. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that this new leasing ASU will have on its financial statements.

	$20 million is contingently refundable to Endo based on a third party generic introduction in the U.S. during the patent extension period from 2020 to 2027. Should such introduction occur any
	time during the 2020 to 2027 period, a refund would be due to Endo based on the number of complete calendar months beyond December 31, 2019 where the first generic was sold over the denominator of 84 months multiplied by $20 million. For example, if
	a generic product were to be introduced in the U.S. in January of 2026, that would mean that 72 of the 84 months of patent exclusivity would have been earned and 12 months would have to be refunded. The calculation would be 12/84, multiplied by $20
	million, for a refund of $2.9 million. The method of the refund payment to Endo would be made first by crediting against milestone payments owed to the Company, second by reducing the royalty by 50% until the $2.9 million is paid back, and third by
	the Company making a payment in the amount due to Endo. Otherwise, the $20 million will be earned as revenue each month over the patent extension period from 2020 to 2027;

	The Company has assessed its arrangement with Endo and the Company&#146;s deliverables thereunder at inception to determine:
	(i)&nbsp;the separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, (ii)&nbsp;which payments should be allocated to which of those units of accounting and (iii)&nbsp;the appropriate revenue recognition pattern or trigger for each of those

	At the inception of the Endo arrangement, the Company determined
	that the Endo Agreement was a multi-deliverable arrangement with three deliverables: (1)&nbsp;the license rights related to BELBUCA&#153;, (2)&nbsp;services related to obtaining enhanced intellectual property rights through the issuance of a
	particular patent and (3)&nbsp;clinical development services. The Company concluded that the license delivered to Endo at the inception of the Endo Agreement has stand-alone value. It was also determined that there was a fourth deliverable, the
	provision of clinical trial material (&#147;CTM&#148;). The amounts involved are, however, immaterial and delivered in essentially the same time frame as the clinical development services. Accordingly, the Company did not separately account for the
	CTM deliverable, but considers it part of the clinical development services deliverable.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The initial non-refundable $30 million license
	fee was allocated to each of the three deliverables based upon their relative selling prices using best estimates. The analysis of the best estimate of the selling price of the deliverables was based on the income approach, the Company&#146;s
	negotiations with Endo and other factors, and was further based on management&#146;s estimates and assumptions which included consideration of how a market participant would use the license, estimated market opportunity and market share, the
	Company&#146;s estimates of what contract research organizations would charge for clinical development services, the costs of clinical trial materials and other factors. Also considered were entity specific assumptions regarding the results of
	clinical trials, the likelihood of FDA approval of the subject product and the likelihood of commercialization based in part on the Company&#146;s prior agreements with the BEMA

	Based on this analysis, $15.6 million of the up-front license fee was allocated to the license and $14.4 million to&nbsp;clinical
	development services (which is inclusive of the cost of CTM).&nbsp;Although the intellectual property component was considered a separate deliverable, no distinct amount of the up-front payment was assigned to this deliverable because the Company
	determined the deliverable to be perfunctory. The amount allocated to the license was recognized as revenue in fiscal year 2012. The portion of the upfront license fee allocated to the clinical development services deliverable of $14.4 million is
	being recognized as those services are performed.&nbsp;The Company estimated that such clinical development services would extend into the first half of 2015.&nbsp;Such services were completed by March 2015 and resulted in the recognition of $0.4
	million, $2.5 million and $6.3 million as contract revenue in fiscal years, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

	property, (v)&nbsp;amend material agreements or organizational documents, (vi)&nbsp;change their business, jurisdictions of organization or their organizational structures or types, (vii)&nbsp;declare or pay dividends (other than dividends payable
	solely in Common Stock), (viii)&nbsp;make certain investments or acquisitions except under certain circumstances as set forth in the Credit Agreement, or (ix)&nbsp;enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain
	exceptions provided for in the Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Credit Agreement amends certain negative covenants contained in the Prior Agreement such that (i)&nbsp;licensing and acquisitions are added as permitted business
	activities of the Company and (ii)&nbsp;the Company is no longer required to obtain the prior written consent of MidCap for any in-licensing, product or entity acquisitions by the Company by way of merger or consolidation, so long as no event of
	default has occurred and certain financial metrics are adhered to.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2012, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) approved the BDSI Performance Long Term Incentive Plan
	(&#147;LTIP&#148;). The LTIP is designed as an incentive for the Company&#146;s senior management to generate revenue for the Company. The LTIP consists of RSUs (which are referred to in this context as Performance RSUs) which are rights to acquire
	shares of Common Stock. All Performance RSUs granted under the LTIP will be granted under the Company&#146;s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (as the same may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time) as &#147;Performance Compensation
	Awards&#148; under such plan. The participants in the LTIP are either named executive officers or senior officers of the Company.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The term
	of the LTIP began with the Company&#146;s fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and lasts through the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2019. The total number of Performance RSUs covered by the LTIP is 1,078,000, of which 978,000 were awarded
	in 2012 (with 100,000 Performance RSUs being reserved for future hires and of that reserve, 35,000 Performance RSUs were awarded in 2015). The Performance RSUs under the LTIP did not vest upon granting, but instead are subject to potential vesting
	each year over the 8 year term of the LTIP depending on the achievement of pre-defined revenue amounts by the Company, as reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, a total of 21,356,
	4,447 and 8,986 RSUs vested, respectively, subject to performance criteria.

	The Company has a 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. During the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the &#147;Annual Meeting&#148;),
	stockholders approved an amendment to the Company&#146;s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan by 2,250,000 shares from 8,800,000 to 11,050,000.

	An additional 1,938,039 shares of Common Stock underlying options previously granted under the Company&#146;s Amended and
	Restated 2001 Incentive Plan remain outstanding and exercisable. The Company&#146;s Amended and Restated 2001 Incentive Plan expired in July 2011 and no new securities may be issued thereunder. Options may be awarded during the ten-year term of the
	2011 Equity Incentive Plan to Company employees, directors, consultants, sales force and other affiliates.

	In November&nbsp;2011, the USPTO rejected all 191 claims of MonoSol&#146;s &#146;588 Patent. On January&nbsp;20, 2012, the
	Company filed requests for reexamination before the USPTO of MonoSol&#146;s US patent No 7,357,891 (the &#146;891 Patent), and No 7,425,292 (the &#146;292 Patent), the two additional patents asserted by MonoSol, demonstrating that all claims of
	those two patents were anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art references, including prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and thus invalid. The USPTO granted the requests for reexamination with respect to
	MonoSol&#146;s &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents. In its initial office action in each, the USPTO rejected every claim in each patent.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As
	expected, in the &#146;891 Patent and &#146;292 Patent Ex Parte Reexamination proceedings, MonoSol amended the claims several times and made multiple declarations and arguments in an attempt to overcome the rejections made by the USPTO. These
	amendments, declarations and other statements regarding the claim language significantly narrowed the scope of their claims in these two patents. In the case of the &#146;891 Patent, not one of the original claims survived reexamination and five
	separate amendments were filed confirming the Company&#146;s position that the patent was invalid. Additionally, the Company believes that arguments and admissions made by MonoSol prevent it from seeking a broader construction during any subsequent
	litigation by employing arguments or taking positions that contradict those made during prosecution.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A Reexamination Certificate for
	MonoSol&#146;s &#146;891 Patent in its amended form was issued August&nbsp;21, 2012 (Reexamined Patent No.&nbsp;7,357,891C1 or the &#146;891C1 Patent). A Reexamination Certificate for MonoSol&#146;s &#146;292 Patent in its amended form was issued on
	July&nbsp;3, 2012 (Reexamined Patent No.&nbsp;7,425,292C1 or the &#146;292C1 Patent). These actions by the USPTO confirm the invalidity of the original patents and through the narrowing of the claims in the reissued patents strengthens the
	Company&#146;s original assertion that its products and technologies do not infringe on MonoSol&#146;s original patents.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On June&nbsp;12,
	2013, despite the Company&#146;s previously noted success in the prior ex parte reexaminations for the &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents, the Company filed requests for
<I>
	inter partes
</I>
	reviews (&#147;IPR&#148;) on the narrowed yet reexamined
	patents, the &#146;292 C1 and &#146;891 C1 Patents, to challenge their validity and continue to strengthen the Company&#146;s position. On November&nbsp;13, 2013, the USPTO decided not to institute the two inter partes reviews for the &#146;891 C1
	and &#146;292 C1 Patents. The USPTO&#146;s decision was purely on statutory grounds and based on a technicality (in that the IPRs were not filed within what the UPSTO determined to be the statutory period) rather than substantive grounds. Thus, even
	though the inter partes reviews were not instituted, the USPTO decision preserves the Company&#146;s right to raise the same arguments at a later time (e.g., during litigation). Regardless, the Company&#146;s assertion that its products and
	technologies do not infringe the original &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents and, now, the reexamined &#146;891 C1 and &#146;292 C1 Patents remains the same.

	Importantly, in the case of MonoSol&#146;s &#146;588 Patent, at the conclusion of the reexamination proceedings (and its appeals process), on
	April&nbsp;17, 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) issued a Decision on Appeal affirming the Examiner&#146;s rejection (and confirming the invalidity) of all the claims of the &#146;588 Patent. MonoSol did not request a rehearing by the
	May&nbsp;17, 2014 due date for making such a request and did not further appeal the Decision to the Federal Court of Appeals by the June&nbsp;17, 2014 due date for making such an appeal. Subsequently, on August&nbsp;5, 2014, the USPTO issued a
	Certificate of Reexamination cancelling the &#145;588 Patent claims.

	does not infringe on patents held by MonoSol, and the denial and subsequent narrowing of the claims on the two reissued patents MonoSol has asserted against
	the Company while the third has had all claims rejected by the USPTO, the Company remains very confident in its original stated position regarding this matter. Thus far, the Company has proven that the &#147;original&#148; &#146;292 and &#146;891
	patents in light of their reissuance with fewer and narrower claims were indeed invalid and the third and final patent, the &#146;588 patent, was invalid as well with all its claims cancelled. Given the outcomes of the &#145;292, &#145;891 and
	&#145;588 reexamination proceedings, at a January&nbsp;22, 2015 status meeting, the Court decided to lift the stay and grant the Company&#146;s request for the case to proceed on an expedited basis with a Motion for Summary Judgment to dismiss the
	action. On September&nbsp;25, 2015, the Honorable Freda L. Wolfson granted the Company&#146;s motion for summary judgment and ordered the case closed. The Company was found to be entitled to absolute intervening rights as to both patents in suit,

	October 2015, MonoSol appealed the decision of the court to the Federal Circuit. The Company has no reason to believe the outcome will be different and will vigorously defend the appeal.&nbsp;MonoSol filed an appeal with the Federal Circuit and has
	subsequently decided to withdraw the appeal.&nbsp;On February&nbsp;25, 2016, MonoSol filed an Unopposed Motion For Voluntary Dismissal Of Appeal,

	but provided MonoSol an opportunity to file a corrected response. MonoSol filed the request in December 2015 and the Company subsequently filed comments on December&nbsp;23, 2015. The Company is awaiting a further decision from the Board, which the
	Company has no reason to believe will be inconsistent with the original decision rendered in March 2015. For the &#145;378 Patent, an IPR was filed on June&nbsp;1, 2014, but an IPR was not instituted. However, in issuing its November&nbsp;5, 2014
	decision not to institute the IPR, the PTAB construed the claims of the &#145;378 Patent narrowly. As in prior litigation proceedings, the Company believes these IPR and the reexamination filings will provide support for maintaining the stay until
	the IPR and reexamination proceedings conclude. Indeed, given the PTAB&#146;s narrow construction of the claims of the &#145;378 Patent, the Company filed a motion to withdraw the &#145;378 Patent from the case on December&nbsp;12, 2014. In
	addition, the Company also filed a joint motion to continue the stay (with RB Plaintiffs) in the proceedings on the same day. Both the motion to withdraw the &#145;378 Patent from the proceedings and motion to continue the stay were granted.

	Clause 3.1 of the Agreement provides that BDSI shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to seek a New Licence of the rights granted under the License and

	event BDSI has been unable to identify and/or agree terms with a New Licensee,
