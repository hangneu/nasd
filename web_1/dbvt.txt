	In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and our management&#146;s assessment

	such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness that we identified is related to a lack of adequate

	If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weakness in our internal control

	Pre-clinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and unpredictable processes that can be subject to
	extensive delays. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. It may take several years to complete the pre-clinical testing and clinical development necessary to commercialize a
	drug or biologic, and delays or failure can occur at any stage. Interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results, and success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials
	will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in earlier trials, and we cannot be certain
	that we will not face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well
	advanced. An unfavorable outcome in one or more trials would be a major setback for our product candidates and for us. Due to our limited financial resources, an unfavorable outcome in one or more trials may require us to delay, reduce the scope of,
	or eliminate one or more product development programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and on the value of our ADSs and ordinary shares.

	The results of pre-clinical studies do not necessarily predict clinical success, and larger and later-stage clinical trials may not produce the same results

	maintaining production quality, protein stability or allergenic strength. Frequently, product candidates developed by pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have shown promising results in early pre-clinical studies or

	efficacy of our product candidates versus placebo. The food challenge protocol is meant to induce objective symptoms of an allergic reaction. These oral food challenge procedures can potentially trigger anaphylaxis or potentially life-threatening
	systemic allergic reactions. Even though these procedures are well-controlled, standardized and performed in highly specialized centers with intensive care units, there are inherent risks in conducting a trial of this nature. An uncontrolled
	allergic reaction could potentially lead to serious or even fatal reactions. Any such serious clinical event could potentially adversely affect our clinical development timelines, including a complete clinical hold on our food allergy clinical
	trials. We may also become liable to subjects who participate in our clinical trials and experience any such serious or fatal reactions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, stock price or financial

	We have obtained breakthrough therapy

	The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, was enacted as part of the 2010 enactments of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
	Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, to establish an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed
	biological reference product. &#147;Biosimilarity&#148; means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and there are no clinically meaningful
	differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency of the product. To meet the higher standard of &#147;interchangeability,&#148; an applicant must provide sufficient information to show
	biosimilarity and demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administrated more than once to an individual, the risk in
	terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the reference product was first
	licensed, and the FDA will not even accept an application for review until four years after the date of first licensure. The law is evolving, complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact,
	implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects
	for our biological products.

	We expect studies combining other methods of immunotherapy, such as oral immunotherapy, or OIT, with anti-IgE treatments will be conducted. These types of

	To our knowledge, other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are also seeking to develop food allergy treatments, although many are in the discovery or

	Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part,
	on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There may be significant delays in obtaining

	does not imply that a product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products,
	drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for

	The ACA is expected to significantly impact the provision of, and payment for, health care in the United States.
	Various provisions of the ACA are designed to expand Medicaid eligibility, subsidize insurance premiums, provide incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibit denials of coverage due to pre-existing conditions, establish health
	insurance exchanges, and provide additional support for medical research. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to
	the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. More recently, both the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, include, among other things, mandatory reductions in Medicare
	payments to certain providers. Additional legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States, could influence the purchase of medicines and reduce demand
	and prices for our products, if approved. This could harm our or our collaborators&#146; ability to market any products and generate revenues. Cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and the effect of further
	healthcare reform could significantly reduce potential revenues from the sale of any of our product candidates approved in the future, and could cause an increase in our compliance, manufacturing, or other operating expenses.

	In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the
	pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its
	member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the
	medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement
	limitations for biopharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, biopharmaceutical products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United
	States and generally tend to have significantly lower prices.

	We believe that pricing pressures at the federal and state levels in the United States, as
	well as internationally, will continue and may increase, which may make it difficult for us to sell our potential products that may be approved in the future at a price acceptable to us or any of our future collaborators.

	Our product candidates are being developed
	to address the needs of severely allergic patients, for some of whom coming into contact with even minute amounts of an allergen can have a profound and life-threatening adverse reaction. Accordingly, safety is of paramount importance in developing
	these product candidates. To date, four clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut and Viaskin Milk product candidates have been conducted both outside and inside of the United States in over 400 human subjects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these
	product candidates for the treatment of peanut allergies and milk allergies. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials have primarily involved general disorders and administration site conditions, such as erythema, pruritus, edema, and
	urticaria. It is worth noting that, as a desensitization patch bringing the allergen into contact with the skin, reactions, which are a source of itching and discomfort for the patient. This reaction is typically temporary in duration and fades

	use due to risk of contamination.

	Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe
	harbors available, it is possible that some of our current and/or future business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example,
	the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes, in that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific
	intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. Moreover, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a

	To date, we do not have biopharmaceutical company status, or PCS, and therefore, cannot manufacture
	the product candidates that we develop in France. A company with premises located in France must submit an application to the French Drug and Health Products Safety Agency, or ANSM, in order to get PCS status. The ANSM grants PCS to a company upon
	evaluation and determination that such company&#146;s premises has adequate personnel, procedure and organization. We intend to seek PCS when our Viaskin patch product candidates have received MAA and thereby have the ability to manufacture our
	product candidates without contracting third parties. There are two types of PCS: (1)&nbsp;distributor &#147;exploitant&#148; status, which permits medicines to be marketed directly in France by the company after demonstrating control of certain key
	functions such as pharmacovigilance, medical information and advertising, management of quality complaints and batch recall; and (2)&nbsp;manufacturer status, which permits the manufacturing and quality control of medicines after demonstrating
	adequate manufacturing and quality control premises that exhibit a quality assurance system that meets cGMP.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Failure to obtain PCS status would force us
	to revise our strategy. First, failure to obtain manufacturer status would force us to entrust the manufacturing and control of the therapeutic products to one or more specialized contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, as is the case with
	the current production of our clinical lots. Second, if distributor &#147;exploitant&#148; status was not obtained, we could not conduct a direct commercial approach to the French market and would therefore have to enter into marketing license
	agreements with other biopharmaceutical companies. Failure to obtain any of the two types of PCS status would affect the production and marketing of our product candidates, once approved, and could be detrimental to our business, earnings, financial

	A key aspect

	of applications in the field of respiratory allergies or autoimmune disease, as well as other therapeutic domains, such as vaccines. Collaboration agreements typically call for milestone payments that depend on successful demonstration of efficacy
	and safety, obtaining regulatory approvals, and clinical trial results. Collaboration revenues are not guaranteed, even when efficacy and safety are demonstrated. The current economic environment may result in potential collaborators electing to

	The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and
	factual questions. The interpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering biopharmaceutical compositions may be uncertain and difficult to determine, and are often affected materially by the facts and circumstances that pertain to
	the patented compositions and the related patent claims. The standards of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, are sometimes uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and scope of patents cannot be
	predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, and U.S. patents may be subject to reexamination proceedings,
	post-grant review and/or inter partes review in the USPTO. Foreign patents may be subject also to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office, which could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the
	patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, reexamination, post-grant review, inter partes review and opposition proceedings may be costly.
	Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition,
	changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products without providing any compensation to us, or may
	limit the number of patents or claims we can obtain. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual
	property rights.

	In addition, the Leahy-Smith
	America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include a transition from a &#147;first-to-invent&#148; system to a
	&#147;first-to-file&#148; system, changes to the way issued patents are challenged, and changes to the way patent applications are disputed during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have
	greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent
	law associated with the America Invents Act, and, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act may affect our ability to obtain
	patents, and if obtained, to enforce or defend them. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and

	In addition to patent protection, because we operate in the highly technical field of development of therapies, we rely in part
	on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We expect to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees,
	consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party
	or made known to the party by us during the course of the party&#146;s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property.

	such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is
	unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or

	If we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our
	product candidate, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are
	commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include alleged failures to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for unenforceability assertions include allegations that someone
	connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even
	outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, e.g., opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment of our patents
	in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or competitive products. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity, for example, we cannot be certain that
	there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the
	patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.

	appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. There is no guarantee that the ADSs will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our shareholders have purchased the ADSs.

	Certain members of our board of directors and senior management, and those of our subsidiary, are non-residents of the United
	States, and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible to serve process on such persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments
	obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. Additionally, it may be difficult to assert U.S. securities law claims in actions originally instituted outside of the United
	States. Foreign courts may refuse to hear a U.S. securities law claim because foreign courts may not be the most appropriate forums in which to bring such a claim. Even if a foreign court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that the law of the
	jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides, and not U.S. law, is applicable to the claim. Further, if U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly
	process, and certain matters of procedure would still be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides. In particular, there is some doubt as to whether French courts would recognize and enforce certain civil liabilities
	under U.S. securities laws in original actions or judgments of U.S. courts based upon these civil liability provisions. In addition, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in France. An
	award for monetary damages under the U.S. securities laws would be considered punitive if it does not seek to compensate the claimant for loss or damage suffered but is intended to punish the defendant. The enforceability of any judgment in France
	will depend on the particular facts of the case as well as the laws and treaties in effect at the time. The United States and France do not currently have a treaty providing for recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration
	awards) in civil and commercial matters.

	We are a clinical-stage specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on changing the
	field of immunotherapy by developing a novel technology platform called Viaskin. Our therapeutic approach is based on epicutaneous immunotherapy, or EPIT, our proprietary method of delivering biologically active compounds to the immune system
	through intact skin using Viaskin. We have generated significant data demonstrating that Viaskin&#146;s mechanism of action is novel and differentiated as it targets specific antigen-presenting immune cells in the skin, called Langerhans cells,
	which capture the antigen and migrate to the lymph node in order to activate the immune system without allowing passage of the antigen into the bloodstream. We are advancing this unique technology to address areas of unmet medical need, including in
	patients suffering from severe food allergies, for whom safety is paramount as the introduction of the offending allergen into their bloodstream can cause severe or life-threatening allergic reactions, such as anaphylactic shock.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our proprietary platform is based on our epicutaneous Viaskin patch. We have designed and developed this technology internally, for which we have scalable
	manufacturing capabilities. Viaskin is an electrostatic patch, which offers a convenient, self-administered, non-invasive immunotherapy to patients. Once applied on intact skin, Viaskin forms a condensation chamber, which hydrates the skin and
	solubilizes the antigen allowing it to penetrate the epidermis, where it is captured by Langerhans cells. Based on numerous scientific publications and our own research, we believe this unique mechanism of action has a favorable safety profile and
	that it generates a strong immune response that results in allergen desensitization. Our epicutaneous immunotherapy method allows us to address severe food allergies, as well as unmet medical needs in other immunotherapy indications.

	allergy-specific immunotherapy commonly referred to as desensitization. Desensitization consists of repeated administration of small quantities of allergen to decrease allergen reactivity in patients. Currently studied desensitization methods
	include subcutaneous, sublingual, and oral immunotherapy, which often require frequent or prolonged administration in highly specialized centers. In academic settings some successful cases exist, but large-scale pharmaceutical development in this
	field has been limited due to both the safety concerns and the commercial viability of these desensitization approaches. These methods may be poorly designed for young children due to their safety profile or the inconvenient method of
	administration. Most importantly, some of these approaches are also known for triggering severe adverse events during treatment, such as anaphylaxis, risking the patient&#146;s life during administration. Further, some of these methods have been
	also associated with an increased risk of adverse long-term treatment effects, such as EoE. As a self-administered treatment with a good safety profile, we believe Viaskin has positioned us as the company with the most advanced clinical program in
	food allergies.

	Background on Allergic Reaction
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An allergic reaction is the body&#146;s inappropriate immune response to a foreign substance, or an allergen. While, for most people, exposure to an allergen
	is relatively harmless, for others, exposure to an allergen can provoke an allergic reaction of varying severity. An allergic reaction typically progresses in two stages.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the first stage, the allergic immune response begins with allergen sensitization. The first time an allergen penetrates the body via the skin or the
	mucosa, for example, the eyes, respiratory or digestive tracts, the immune system identifies the foreign element as dangerous and begins to produce specific antibodies against it. Antibodies are substances produced by the immune system that
	recognize and destroy certain foreign elements to which the body is exposed. The immune system produces different types of antibodies targeted to specific allergens. For allergic people, this phenomenon is known as sensitization. In the second stage
	of an allergic reaction, upon re-exposure to the allergen, the now sensitized immune system is ready to react. The antibody seeks to eliminate the allergen by triggering a collection of defense responses causing an allergic reaction. In various
	types of allergies, including food allergies, the antibody IgE plays an essential role in the development of the allergic disease. IgE is known for binding to allergens and triggering the release of cellular substances that can cause inflammation,
	thus triggering a cascade of allergic reactions. Allergic reactions range in severity and include hives, itching, swelling, shortness of breath, vomiting and cardiac arrhythmia. Reactions vary in duration, and allergy patients experience these
	symptoms frequently unless treated properly. The most severe allergic reaction is anaphylaxis, which if not treated quickly by epinephrine injection, may progress to anaphylactic shock causing a rapid drop in blood pressure, loss of consciousness
	and possibly death within a few minutes.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For food allergies, there are no approved symptomatic or disease-modifying allergy treatments. By contrast, in the case of respiratory allergies, symptomatic
	allergy treatments, such as antihistamines, bronchodilators and corticosteroids, are among the most widely used treatments in the world. Non-sedating antihistamines such as histamine H1 inhibitors are the mainstay treatment for respiratory
	allergies. Allegra and Zyrtec are two leading antihistamines treatments. Another method of symptomatic treatment consists of blocking production of IgE, the allergy antibody.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However, all these treatments treat the symptoms of allergies, and are not intended to treat the underlying causes of the allergic reaction itself. As a
	result, when the treatment course is finished, the patient is once again susceptible to the original allergen and typically will suffer a similar allergic reaction if re-exposed to the original allergen.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Allergies can lead to severe reactions that require the use of treatments that have been designated to treat allergic symptoms during emergency situations,
	such as anaphylactic reactions. Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is the most widely used treatment for anaphylactic reactions, and it is usually administered by injection. The most commonly used type of epinephrine injections are Epipen
	Auto-Injectors, or Epipens, which are indicated for the emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions including sudden anaphylaxis or for patients with a history of anaphylactic reactions to known triggers. Patients at risk of anaphylaxis are
	instructed by their physicians on how to recognize the symptoms of anaphylaxis and on when to use the Epipens. Epinephrine injections help relieve the symptoms of anaphylaxis, but they do not treat or help address the underlying causes of the
	allergic disease.

	Desensitization Allergy Treatments and their Limitations
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Another therapeutic approach for the treatment of allergies is through a type of immunotherapy, called desensitization therapy. Desensitization therapy
	consists of repeated administration of increasing quantities of allergen to decrease reactivity in allergic patients. It is currently recognized by the World Health Organization, or WHO, as the preferred therapeutic treatment for allergies.
	Desensitization therapy is widely used in respiratory allergies and allergies to insect bites. This treatment is traditionally performed by subcutaneous injections of increasing doses of the allergen at regular intervals in the hospital and under
	the supervision of a physician. Less invasive methods of administration, including oral drops and sublingual, or under the tongue, tablets, have also been developed to permit a simplified treatment that can be administered at home. For patients
	allergic to dust mites or pollen, desensitization by injection is the standard method of therapy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However, while desensitization has shown potential in
	less severe allergies such as house dust mites or pollen, for food allergies and other severe allergies such as to peanut or milk proteins, existing desensitization therapies are not routinely used due to the high risk of anaphylactic shock,
	especially in young children. Subcutaneous methods of desensitization have been shown to cause significant side effects. Clinical trials have been performed using oral immunotherapy, which consists in feeding small amounts of the offending allergen
	to the patient. While some of these trials have shown a desensitization effect, these therapies have been shown to trigger a high proportion of severe systemic reactions in certain cases, and we believe that this has limited their pharmaceutical
	development in the past.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, with current desensitization techniques, the achieved immunity may be short-lived; many patients are not able to
	tolerate the allergen permanently. A therapeutic approach that promotes tolerization to the allergen would be of particular clinical and societal benefit.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	According to a paper published by the AAAAI, approximately 3% to 5% of Americans suffer from food allergies, with a number of recent studies suggesting that
	nearly 6&nbsp;million or approximately 8% of children have some type of food allergy. Food allergies, in particular, can lead to extremely dangerous reactions and often lead to anaphylactic shock. According to a paper published in the Immunology and
	Allergy Clinics of North America, food, mainly peanut allergies, are responsible for 150 to 200 deaths every year in the United States. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that food allergies result in more than 300,000
	ambulatory-care visits per year among children under the age of 18. Every three minutes a food allergy reaction sends someone to the emergency department, which is about 200,000 emergency department visits per year, and every six minutes the
	reaction is one of anaphylaxis. A recent U.S. study indicates an increase of 350% in the number of hospitalizations of children below age 18 for diagnosis of a food allergy for the period from 2004 to 2006 as compared to the period from 1998 to
	2000. According to a paper published in the Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America, the majority of fatal anaphylactic reactions in patients are caused by peanut allergy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While anaphylactic shock is the most severe allergic reaction to food, patients also suffer from a poor quality of life. Symptoms tend to disappear within
	hours of exposure but, in some cases, can continue to affect patients for several days. Reactions can include, but are not limited to, skin discomfort, hay fever-like symptoms, impaired lung function and gastrointestinal complications, such as
	sustained bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In some cases, food allergies can lead to chronic diseases such as failure to thrive in children and EoE.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Recent studies suggest that patients with food allergies are especially at risk for experiencing significant disruption to their daily life. Food allergies
	are not only a physical disability; they are often associated with psychological traumas, including fear of eating, antisocial behavior and anxiety. In the case of pediatric patients, food allergies also have a significant impact on their
	caretakers. A recent study suggests that the quality of life in children with peanut allergy is more impaired than in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

	Strict avoidance of food allergens and early recognition and management of allergic reactions to food are important measures to prevent serious health

	For example, according to a paper published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, or JACI, it is estimated that accidental exposure to peanuts in peanut allergic patients occurs once every three to five years and the annual incidence of
	accidental ingestion is between 15% and 40%.

	Recent scientific studies suggest that treating allergies early in life could prevent disease progression or the development
	of polyallergies. A study of children desensitized to pollen and monitored for five years demonstrated that treating pollen allergy reduced the development of asthma. This early intervention, when the immune system is not mature, is referred to as
	the &#147;window of opportunity.&#148; Thus, research suggests that addressing allergies during this time in life is likely of critical clinical importance.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Over the last decade, we have developed an innovative immunotherapy technology platform,
	with the potential for sustained therapeutic effect, by delivering biologically active compounds, including antigens, via intact skin. This technology platform, which we call Viaskin, is based on an electrostatic patch, which administers the antigen
	directly on the skin. Once administered, the antigen is concentrated in the superficial layers of the skin, where it activates the immune system by specifically targeting the Langerhans cells, without passage of the antigen into the bloodstream. We
	refer to this novel approach to immunotherapy as epicutaneous immunotherapy, or EPIT. Based on our trials and research, we believe that EPIT has the potential to provide all of the intended benefits of a disease-modifying treatment in allergy, while
	avoiding severe or life-threatening allergic reactions.

	Viaskin&#151;Targeting the Unique Immunological Properties of Epicutaneous Langerhans Cells

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Viaskin&#146;s effect on the immune system has been the subject of numerous scientific analyses and publications, which have been featured in major medical
	journals and allergology conferences. These epigenetic and mechanistic studies have helped us characterize the Viaskin&#146;s novel mechanism of action.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our mechanism of action is unique and differentiated as it targets specific epidermal dendritic cells, called Langerhans cells, which capture the antigen and
	migrate to the lymph node in order to activate the immune system without passage of the antigen into the bloodstream. After the antigen has been presented to the T cells in the lymph node, it activates the Tregs, the main factor in the
	down-regulation of Th2 response, while barely influencing the Th1 expression, thus rebalancing the immune response.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Th2 cells are thought to play a role
	in allergic responses because allergies are known to be Th2 dominant conditions. An elevated Th2 response is ultimately responsible for the production of IgE, which can cause inflammation and trigger allergic reactions. Conversely, a normal, or
	non-allergic, immune response to an allergen is usually characterized by a well-balanced Th1/Th2 response.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that EPIT can rebalance the immune
	reaction by decreasing, or down-regulating, the Th2 response to allergens, keeping Th1 and Th2 balanced and thus promoting long-term tolerance toward future allergen exposure. The first documentation of this mechanistic feature of our Viaskin patch
	in humans was presented at the 2016 AAAAI Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, California.

	Viaskin Peanut 250 &micro;g. Results from PEPITES are expected in the second half of 2017. In September 2014, we announced topline results from our VIPES trial, a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase IIb clinical trial of
	Viaskin Peanut, which was followed by a full study report presented at the 2015 AAAAI Annual Meeting in Houston, Texas. The trial met its primary endpoint at the highest explored dose (Viaskin Peanut 250 &micro;g), achieving statistical significance
	(p&lt;0.01) in the percentage of treatment responders versus placebo. Our VIPES trial is the largest clinical trial in peanut allergy desensitization ever completed. Following the completion of VIPES, 171 patients enrolled in a two-year open label
	follow-up study, OLFUS-VIPES, which reported its first-year results in October 2015, followed by a complete study report in March 2016 during the AAAAI meeting in Los Angeles, California. Findings from the first twelve months of OLFUS-VIPES suggest
	that the treatment effect of Viaskin Peanut increases over time in children. In OLFUS-VIPES, we observed that 12 additional months of therapy with Viaskin Peanut 250 &micro;g increased the number of patients benefiting from treatment to 70% in
	OLFUS-VIPES from 50% in VIPES, with 80% of children (ages six-11 at entry in VIPES) responding to therapy after 24 months. Viaskin Peanut has also been explored independently in two large academic trials, CoFAR6 and ARACHILD. CoFAR6, a Consortium of
	Food Allergy Research, or CoFAR, study sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, met its primary endpoint in cohorts treated with both Viaskin Peanut 100 &micro;g (P=0.005) and Viaskin Peanut 250 &micro;g

	Peanut allergy is one of the
	most common food allergies, and can cause severe, potentially fatal, allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Strict avoidance of peanut is essential, as even trace amounts of peanut can cause severe allergic reactions. According to recent
	studies, food allergies, mainly peanut, are responsible for 150 to 200 deaths every year in the United States and about 200,000 emergency room visits. While anaphylactic shock is the most severe allergic reaction to peanuts, many patients also
	suffer from a poor quality of life. Peanut allergies have lifelong effects and are often associated with psychological traumas, including fear of eating, antisocial behavior and anxiety.

	Allergy to peanuts appears to be on the rise and its prevalence has increased in the past 10 years. According to an article published in JACI, a recent survey

	has doubled in five years in children below age five. A study funded by Food Allergy Research and Education, Inc., or FARE, indicates that the number of children in the United States with peanut allergy more than tripled between 1997 and 2008.
	Although some patients outgrow their peanut allergies, research indicates that only about 20% of individuals with peanut allergy outgrow it during a lifetime.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2015, we initiated a pivotal Phase III trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Viaskin Peanut 250 &micro;g in children four to 11
	years of age suffering from peanut allergy. PEPITES is an international, randomized 2:1, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study, in which pediatric peanut allergic patients will be treated with Viaskin Peanut 250 &micro;g or placebo for 12
	months. During the trial, patients&#146; peanut allergy will be assessed using a double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge, or DBPCFC, at baseline. The DBPCFC will be halted once the subject exhibits an objective symptom, as described on a
	pre-specified scale, thus establishing a subject&#146;s peanut reactivity level, which is labeled as the patient&#146;s eliciting dose, or ED. As in VIPES, subjects will receive a daily application of Viaskin Peanut or placebo over a 12-month
	treatment period. Each patch will be applied for 24 hours on the back of children.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Both the FDA and the EMA have agreed to a combined primary endpoint
	based on a responder analysis after 12 months of treatment. For patients with a baseline peanut protein ED equal to or less than 10 mg, a responder will be defined as a patient with a peanut protein ED equal to or greater than 300 mg of peanut
	protein after 12 months of treatment. For subjects with a baseline ED greater than 10 mg, a responder will be defined as a patient with a peanut protein eliciting dose equal to or greater than 1,000 mg of peanut protein after 12 months of treatment.
	Secondary endpoints will include the change from baseline of mean and median cumulative reactive dose of peanut protein, or CRD, which is used to establish the total quantity of peanut protein consumed during the DBPCFC. Serological markers will
	also be measured at baseline, three, six and 12 months in order to characterize the immunological changes in subjects.

	In August 2012, we initiated VIPES, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase IIb clinical trial of Viaskin Peanut in 221 peanut allergic subjects
	with a well-documented medical history of systemic reactions after ingestion of peanut. Subjects completed their last food challenge visits after twelve months of treatment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The VIPES trial was a multi-center clinical trial conducted at 22 sites in North America and Europe. In the trial, 221 peanut-allergic subjects were
	randomized into four treatment arms to evaluate three doses of Viaskin Peanut, specifically 50 &micro;g, 100 &micro;g and 250 &micro;g peanut protein, compared to placebo. The trial was prospectively organized across the three dose levels with two
	patient strata, composed of three different patient age groups: children (113 subjects, ages six-11) for the first stratum and adolescents (73 subjects, ages 12-17) plus adults (35 subjects, ages 18-55) for the other stratum. Each patient underwent
	two DBPCFCs: one at initial screening and one at 12 months after initiation of treatment. The challenge was halted once the subject exhibited an objective symptom, thus establishing a subject&#146;s ED. Patients in VIPES received a daily application
	of the Viaskin Peanut patch over a 12-month treatment period. Each patch was applied for 24 hours, either on the upper arm for adults (age 18-55) and adolescents (age 12-17) or on the back of children (age six-11).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Baseline peanut tolerance levels were established by measuring the peanut eliciting dose at which patients began to exhibit allergy symptoms, thus
	establishing the reactive baseline dose. The median baseline reactive dose in VIPES was 30 mg for children and 100 mg for adolescents and adults. The distribution of patients&#146; baseline reactive dose is summarized in the graph below.

	eliciting dose of peanut protein compared to baseline. As a secondary efficacy endpoint, CRD was also used to establish the total quantity of peanut protein that began triggering patient reactions at month 12 versus placebo. Serological markers were
	also measured as additional secondary endpoints at baseline, three, six and 12 months in order to characterize the immunological changes in subjects. In terms of peanut consumption and immunological changes, a consistent dose effect was observed.

	Monitoring Board, or DSMB, meetings concluded that VIPES did not have any safety concerns. In the trial, there were 20 SAEs, but none related to study drug. Of the 20 SAEs in VIPES, 14 were anaphylaxes during the DBPCFC, three were moderate
	anaphylaxes after accidental consumption of peanut containing foods outside of clinical trial site, one was a reaction to fish consumption, one respiratory distress case and one psychiatric case. The trial drop-out rate was 6.4%, or 14 patients,
	which was below the 15% rate initially anticipated. Two of the 14 drop-outs were related to the study drug due to dermatitis, one was due to uncontrolled asthma not related to treatment and the remaining 11 patients were drop-outs due to

	In September 2013, we initiated an open-label follow-up Phase IIb clinical trial called OLFUS-VIPES to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of Viaskin
	Peanut in subjects with peanut allergy. OLFUS-VIPES is an extension trial for subjects having completed the VIPES double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, during which all subjects are under active treatment with Viaskin Peanut 250 &micro;g.
	OLFUS-VIPES includes 171 subjects at 21 sites in North America and Europe, representing 83% of the patients who completed 12 months of therapy in the VIPES trial. The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of Viaskin Peanut
	after up to 36 months of epicutaneous immunotherapy in peanut allergic subjects, as well as sustained unresponsiveness of subjects to peanut protein after cessation of treatment.

	In October 2015, we announced
	topline results for OLFUS-VIPES, which show that the treatment effect with Viaskin Peanut seems to increase over time in children. Additional results were also presented by Dr.&nbsp;Sampson during the 2016 AAAAI meeting in Los Angeles, California.
	In the topline results for OLFUS-VIPES, we observed that 12 additional months of therapy with Viaskin Peanut 250 &micro;g increased the number of patients benefiting from treatment to 70% in OLFUS from 50% in VIPES. No drug-related epinephrine use
	or SAEs due to Viaskin Peanut were reported. The study&#146;s median compliance rate, which was maintained at 96%, was also consistent with previously reported results from VIPES.

	Moreover, the response rate in children (ages six-11 at entry in VIPES) treated with the 250 &micro;g dose for 24 months was observed to increase to 80% from
	57% at OLFUS baseline; the average CRD for the this treatment group was 1,883 mg (1,440 mg median) of peanut protein compared to 84 mg (44 mg median) at baseline during VIPES entry [Figure 6]. Serological markers for this treatment group showed the
	strengthening of the immunological changes initially observed in VIPES. After 24 months, a median 40% decrease from the VIPES baseline value in peanut-specific IgE was observed, while the high median levels in immunoglobulin G4m, or IgG4, were

	In July 2010, we initiated our first clinical trial of Viaskin Peanut in the United States, which was a Phase Ib trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability
	of repeated epicutaneous administration of Viaskin Peanut in patients allergic to peanuts. Results from this trial were published in February 2016 in JACI. In the trial, which was conducted at five leading centers in the United States, 100 subjects
	(initially adults, followed by adolescents and then children) allergic to peanuts, including 70 with a non-severe allergy and 30 with a severe allergy, were randomized and treated for two weeks with 20 &micro;g to 500 &micro;g of Viaskin Peanut or

	The ARACHILD trial is a pilot trial conducted in France by the AP-HP. It is a DBPCFC trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of Viaskin Peanut in peanut
	allergic patients recruited from six centers. In the trial, 54 patients (35 children (age five to 11) and 19 adolescents (age 12 to 18)), were randomized into two treatment arms to evaluate a single dose of Viaskin Peanut, specifically
	100&nbsp;&micro;g of peanut protein, compared to placebo. Patients in the placebo arm were crossed over at six months to Viaskin Peanut without unblinding the trial. Each patient underwent DBPCFCs at months six, 12 and 18 after initiation of
	treatment. After the initial double-blind six-month treatment period, all patients went through an open-label period of 30 months. The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of patients who achieved at least a 10-fold increase in initial
	reactive dose or CRD greater than 1,000 mg of peanut protein (about four peanuts). The secondary endpoints included significant immunological changes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	June 2013, AP-HP reported the results from the initial six-month double-blind placebo-controlled phase of the trial and for the first 12 months of the open-label follow-up phase. In the active group (28 subjects), six-, 12- and 18-month data showed
	7.4%, 20% and 40% of subjects, respectively, consuming at least 10 times more peanut protein than tolerated at the beginning of the trial (versus 7.7% in the placebo arm before the crossover to Viaskin Peanut at month six, then 13% and 19%
	respectively after the crossover). Net trends of a specific sub-analysis of 19 adolescents (age 12 to 17) showed that despite a positive serological response of IgE, no adolescents qualified as responders at six, 12 and 18 months. In an analysis of
	35 children (age five to 11), we observed not only a positive serological response of IgE, but also that an immunological response is characteristic of an acquisition of tolerance leading to a continuous and progressive number of responders. For the
	children subgroup, six-, 12- and 18- month data showed 12.5%, 33.3% and 66.7% of subjects, respectively, consuming at least 10 times more peanut protein than at the beginning of the trial (versus 10.5% in the placebo arm before the crossover to
	Viaskin Peanut at month six, then 16.7% and 23.5%, respectively, after the crossover). Viaskin Peanut also showed significant immunological changes (secondary efficacy endpoints) in the overall population, with clear-cut results in children. In
	treated children, peanut-specific IgE were increased by more than two-fold at 6-month, before decreasing and approaching toward initial levels at 18-month, while peanut-specific IgG4 (immunoglobulin G4) increased by more than eight-fold over
	18-month of treatment.

	Additional analyses of these data also suggest a linear relationship between body surface and response rate as well as onset of
	response. This analysis supports the belief that the 100 &micro;g dose in Viaskin Peanut used in Arachild was potentially too low to generate a significant clinical outcome in patients with a higher body surface. In addition, these data also suggest
	that levels of the antibody IGg4 are potentially a good predictor of future patient response.

	CMPA is frequently the first
	allergy that appears during early childhood. CMPA is often missed in the primary care setting and can be a significant cause of infant distress when left undiagnosed. Symptoms can include gastrointestinal problems such as vomiting and diarrhea, skin
	rash, angioedema or rapid swelling of the skin, and anaphylaxis. The only option available for CMPA management is the avoidance of cow&#146;s milk, which can lead to issues of dietary imbalance, failure to thrive and poor quality of life.

	In addition, cow&#146;s milk allergy is believed to be involved in a majority of cases of EoE in children and it is estimated that EoE impacts one in every
	2,000 children. EoE is a recently recognized allergic inflammatory disease, characterized by swelling of the esophagus. Typical symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, regurgitation, dysphagia and, in young children and infants, feeding
	difficulties and failure to thrive. Because the diverse and non-specific symptoms, EoE can be diagnosed only by esophageal biopsy. In addition to presenting symptoms, acute and chronic complications that may arise if EoE remains untreated include
	food impaction, esophageal stricture, narrow-caliber esophagus and esophageal perforation. EoE is considered to be a chronic condition with no currently approved treatments.

	We have engineered the Viaskin patch with an electrically conductive backing in order to use an electrospray in its assembly.
	This conductive backing is placed under the machine&#146;s cone at a specified distance; the patch is also grounded so that the electric field lines can be directed onto its surface. The dry particles from the electrospray follow these field lines
	and settle on the patch&#146;s backing due to the attraction and conductivity produced by the electrostatic forces on the ground. Due to this process, the dry protein layers on the patch are homogenous and no loss of substance occurs during the

	The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act to account for at least some of the time the
	drug or device is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug or device for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the
	term of one U.S. patent. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug or device. Some foreign jurisdictions have analogous
	patent term extension provisions that allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a device approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our Viaskin electrostatic patch receives FDA approval, we expect
	to apply for a patent term extension on the patent that we believe will provide the best exclusivity position if extended.

	The data required to support a BLA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. The pre-clinical development stage generally
	involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical studies must comply with federal
	regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of
	the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND
	automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor
	and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly,
	we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified
	investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#146;s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical
	trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess
	efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing
	each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are
	minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until
	completed.

	There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial
	results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
	Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the
	results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for
	publication of all trial-related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs and biologics that never garner approval could require disclosure in the future. In addition, publication policies of major

	Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase I, Phase II and
	Phase III clinical trials. Phase I clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to
	assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. Phase II clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to
	determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary
	evaluation of efficacy. Phase III clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate
	the efficacy of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase III clinical trials may include comparisons with
	placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval
	of a BLA.

	used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further
	assess the biologic&#146;s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Following
	trial completion, trial data is analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the
	manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the product candidate, and other relevant information. The BLA is a request for approval to market the
	biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. The application includes both negative or ambiguous results of
	pre-clinical and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated
	by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained
	before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a
	significant user fee, which is adjusted on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in
	certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Once a BLA has been accepted for
	filing, which occurs, if at all, sixty days after the BLA&#146;s submission, the FDA&#146;s goal is to review BLAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review or six months of the filing date for priority review, if the application is
	for a product intended for a serious or life-threatening condition and the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional
	information or clarification.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the
	proposed product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate&#146;s identity, strength, quality, purity and
	potency. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug product candidates or drug product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for
	review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making
	decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of a BLA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may
	take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a
	pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with
	cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving a BLA,

	the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may
	issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of
	the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require
	additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued,
	the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the
	criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs
	during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific populations, severities of allergies, and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict
	the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling,
	development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase IV testing which involves
	clinical trials designed to further assess the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other
	conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will
	not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization
	tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems
	occur following initial marketing.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain
	criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet
	medical need. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track
	product concurrently with the submission of an IND or at any time before a pre-NDA meeting, and the FDA must determine if the product qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request. Unique to a fast
	track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA
	agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite
	development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review, or review within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete BLA is accepted for filing, if it treats a serious condition and
	has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an
	effort to facilitate the review.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety
	and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and
	well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible
	morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to
	be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as:

	control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution
	of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
	Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements
	with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified
	suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that
	interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of

	The FDA also may require post-approval testing,
	sometimes referred to as Phase IV testing, risk minimization action plans and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
	Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA,
	mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#146;s approved labeling, including the
	addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#146;s

	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be
	eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five
	years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval
	date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the
	review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the
	expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed
	patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.

	A reference biological product is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an
	application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure. &#147;First licensure&#148; typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was
	licensed in the United States. This does not include a supplement for the biological product or a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity)
	for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength, unless that change is a modification to the structure of the biological product and such
	modification changes its safety, purity, or potency. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the &#147;first licensure&#148; of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the

	In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Community MA,
	which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire
	territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of
	AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant
	therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	National MAs, which are issued by
	the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for
	marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be
	approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of
	which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet,
	which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States, or CMSs) for their approval. If the CMSs raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging
	proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e. in the RMS and the CMSs).

	Significant
	uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval. Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products, once approved,
	will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services.
	The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that a payor will pay for the
	drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved drugs for a particular indication.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product candidate that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic
	studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product candidate, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Whether or not we conduct such studies, our product
	candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s
	determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Third party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high
	enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal
	and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls,
	restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could
	further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidate or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidate could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a
	material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.

	For example, the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has already had, and is
	expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, among
	other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the full impact of the ACA on
	biopharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred.

	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget
	Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked with recommending to Congress proposals in spending reductions. Because they did not achieve a

	additional Congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions
	of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the
	government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay
	for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.

	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug
	pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control
	the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product
	on the market. For example, in France, effective access to the market assumes that our future products will be supported by the hospital (through an agreement for local communities) or reimbursed by social security. The price of medications is
	negotiated with the Economic Committee for Health Products, or CEPS. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing
	arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.

	We are a clinical-stage specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on changing the field of immunotherapy by developing a novel technology platform called
	Viaskin. Our therapeutic approach is based on epicutaneous immunotherapy, or EPIT, our proprietary method of delivering biologically active compounds to the immune system through intact skin using Viaskin. We have generated significant data
	demonstrating that Viaskin&#146;s mechanism of action is novel and differentiated, as it targets specific antigen-presenting immune cells in the skin, called Langerhans cells, that capture the antigen and migrate to the lymph node in order to
	activate the immune system without passage of the antigen into the bloodstream. We are advancing this unique technology to treat patients, including infants and children, suffering from severe food allergies, for whom safety is paramount, since the
	introduction of the offending allergen into their bloodstream can cause severe or life-threatening allergic reactions, such an anaphylactic shock.

	Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Some of the accounting methods and policies used in preparing our financial statements under
	IFRS are based on complex and subjective assessments by our management or on estimates based on past experience and assumptions deemed realistic and reasonable based on the circumstances concerned. The actual value of our assets, liabilities and
	shareholders&#146; equity and of our earnings could differ from the value derived from these estimates if conditions changed and these changes had an impact on the assumptions adopted. We believe that the most significant management judgments and

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since inception we have
	received multiple interest-free conditional advances from OSEO Innovation, or OSEO, the French Agency for Innovation and part of the
<I>
	Banque Publique d&#146;Investissement
</I>
	. OSEO&#146;s mission is to provide assistance and financial support to
	emerging French enterprises by providing such enterprises with growth capital to facilitate the development and commercialization of innovative technologies. Each award of a conditional advance is made to help fund a specific development project.
	See Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the case of the conditional
	advances from OSEO, our obligation to repay these amounts is based on the technical and commercial success of the funded project, as determined by OSEO in its sole and subjective discretion. Once a project has been selected for funding by OSEO, both
	a payment and a repayment schedule are defined by contract. As the project advances, we provide OSEO with one or more interim progress reports and a final report when the funded project ends. Based on these reports, OSEO makes a subjective
	determination, in its sole discretion, as to whether the project is a partial or total technical or commercial success, or a technical or commercial failure. In the event OSEO determines that the project is a failure, we are required by contract to
	repay a minimum amount. In the event OSEO determines that the project is a partial success, there is a specified repayment schedule, provided that the parties may renegotiate a different repayment schedule in good faith. In the event OSEO determines
	that the project is a complete success, we are obliged to repay 100% of the amount of the conditional advance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the case of each conditional advance,
	we assume that OSEO will determine the project to be a total technical or commercial success and thus the maximum amount repayable with respect to such project will become due. However, actual results related to the development of these programs may
	differ from these estimates in which case the financial liability reflected in our statement of financial statements for the conditional advances may be reduced. The current and non-current portions of the financial liability recognized in our
	statement of financial statements associated with these conditional advances are determined based on the applicable reimbursement schedules at the end of each reporting period. The portion of the conditional advances for terms longer than one year
	is classified as a non-current liability while the portion for terms of less than one year is classified as a current liability. In addition, in the case of each conditional advance, we treat the benefit resulting from the interest-free nature of
	the award as a subsidy and recognize this amount as other income over the applicable repayment period. We determine the amount of this deemed subsidy amount by applying a discount rate equal to the rate of fungible treasury bonds over the time
	period that corresponds to the time period of the repayment of the advances.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to the conditional advances described above, since inception, we
	have received one non-refundable subsidy from OSEO in connection with our development of our legacy house dust mite product candidate. We refer to this development program as the ImmunaVia project. We account for this non-refundable subsidy as other
	income ratably over the duration of the funded project.

	In September 2007, we entered into an agreement with the French Export Credit Insurance Company, or COFACE, to support the promotion of our Diallertest Milk
	product internationally. COFACE offers and manages, on behalf and under the guarantee of the French State, public guarantees to support exportations and investments made by French companies abroad. Under the terms of this agreement, we must repay
	these advances at up to 7% of the revenues from the export of our Diallertest Milk until April&nbsp;30, 2017. To date, our export revenues for Diallertest Milk have been modest. During the second half of 2015, we discontinued our commercial
	partnership with respect to the product and ceased selling Diallertest Milk. We do not expect to derive any 2016 revenues from the sale of Diallertest Milk.

</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have
	various share-based compensation plans for employees and non-employees. We account for share-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on share-based compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance,
	share-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair
	value of share options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include the expected term of the
	options, our share price volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Fair Value of
	Our Ordinary Shares.
</I>
	We established a policy of using the closing sales price per ordinary share as quoted on Euronext Paris on the date prior to the date of grant for purposes of determining the fair value of ordinary shares with a floor value
	of 95% of the average of the closing sales price per ordinary share for the 20 trading days preceding the grant.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Expected Term.
</I>
	The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the share option awards granted, we have based our expected
	term on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the award.

<I>
	Risk-Free Interest Rate.

	The

	capital increases completed in November 2013 and in October 2014, the financial revenues having increased from &#128;0.67&nbsp;million in 2013 to &#128;0.73&nbsp;million in 2014. This was partly offset by a net foreign exchange loss of

	We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements until the end of
	2017. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In any event, we will require additional capital to pursue pre-clinical and clinical activities,

	Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our product
	candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding and collaborations. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms,
	if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.
	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing shareholders, increased fixed payment obligations and these securities may have rights senior to those of our
	ordinary shares. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to
	acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.

	to contract for and maintain liability insurance against civil liabilities incurred by any of their directors and officers involved in a third-party action, provided that they acted in good faith and

	Historically, non-employee warrants were typically granted by our board of directors to non-employee directors, members of our Scientific Advisory Board and
	other service providers not eligible for either employee warrants or employee share options. In addition to any exercise price payable by a holder upon the exercise of any non-employee warrant, non-employee warrants need to be subscribed for a price

	We currently have seven directors, less than a majority of whom are citizens or residents of the United&nbsp;States. Under French law and our by-laws, our
	board of directors must be composed of between three and 18 members. Within this limit, the number of directors is determined by our shareholders. Directors are elected, re-elected and may be removed at a shareholders&#146; general meeting with a
	simple majority vote of our shareholders. Pursuant to our by-laws, our directors are elected for two-year terms. In accordance with French law, our by-laws also provide that our directors may be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote
	of the holders of at least a majority of the votes of the shareholders present, represented by a proxy or voting by mail at the relevant ordinary shareholders&#146; meeting, and that any vacancy on our board of directors resulting from the death or
	resignation of a director, provided there are at least three directors remaining, may be filled by vote of a majority of our directors then in office provided that there has been no shareholders meeting since such death or resignation. Directors
	chosen or appointed to fill a vacancy shall be elected by the board of directors for the remaining duration of the current term of the replaced director. The appointment must then be ratified at the next shareholders&#146; general meeting. In the
	event the board of directors would be composed of less than three directors as a result of a vacancy, the remaining directors shall immediately convene a shareholders&#146; general meeting to elect one or several new directors so there are at least
	three directors serving on the board of directors, in accordance with French law.

	As a foreign private issuer, we are required to comply with Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act relating to audit committee composition and responsibilities.
	Rule&nbsp;10A-3 provides that the audit committee must have direct responsibility for the nomination, compensation and choice of our auditors, as well as control over the performance of their duties, management of complaints made, and selection of
	consultants. However, if the laws of a foreign private issuer&#146;s home country require that any such matter be approved by the board of directors or the shareholders, the audit committee&#146;s responsibilities or powers with respect to such
	matter may instead be advisory. Under French law, the audit committee may only have an advisory role and appointment of our statutory auditors, in particular, must be decided by the shareholders at our general shareholders&#146; meeting.

	on a capital increase by capitalization of reserves, profits or share premium, or (2)&nbsp;25% of the shares entitled to vote in the case of any other extraordinary shareholders&#146; general meeting. If a quorum is not present, the meeting is
	adjourned. There is no quorum requirement when an ordinary general meeting is reconvened, but the reconvened meeting may consider only questions which were on the agenda of the adjourned meeting. When an extraordinary general meeting is reconvened,
	the quorum required is 20% of the shares entitled to vote, except where the reconvened meeting is considering capital increases through capitalization of reserves, profits or share premium. For these matters, no quorum is required at the reconvened
	meeting. If a quorum is not present at a reconvened meeting requiring a quorum, then the meeting may be adjourned for a maximum of two months. See &#147;Item 10.B&#151;Memorandum and Articles of Association.&#148;

	We have adopted a

	arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which we and any related parties are, were or will be participants, which are not (1)&nbsp;in the ordinary course of business, (2)&nbsp;at
	arms&#146; length and (3)&nbsp;in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee or director are not covered by this policy. For purposes of this policy, a related party is

	Under the policy, if a transaction has been identified as a related-party transaction, including any transaction that was not a related-party
	transaction when originally consummated or any transaction that was not initially identified as a related-party transaction prior to consummation, our management must present information regarding the related-party transaction to our board of
	directors for review, consideration and approval. The presentation must include a description of, among other things, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related parties, the benefits to us of the transaction and whether
	the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or from, as the case may be, an unrelated third-party or to or from employees generally. Under the policy, we will collect information that we deem reasonably necessary from
	each director, executive officer and, to the extent feasible, significant shareholder to enable us to identify any existing or potential related-party transactions and to effectuate the terms of the policy. In addition, under our Code of Business
	Conduct and Ethics, our employees and directors have an affirmative responsibility to disclose any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. In considering related-party transactions, our
	board, or to the extent permitted by applicable law an independent body of our board, will take into account the relevant available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to:

	&#148; below, the gross amount of
	any distribution (before reduction for any amounts withheld in respect of French withholding tax) actually or constructively received by a U.S. holder with respect to ADSs will be taxable to the U.S. holder as a dividend to the extent of the U.S.
	holder&#146;s pro rata share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of earnings and profits will be non-taxable to the U.S. holder to the extent of, and
	will be applied against and reduce, the U.S. holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs. Distributions in excess of earnings and profits and such adjusted tax basis will generally be taxable to the U.S. holder as either long-term or short-term
	capital gain depending upon whether the U.S. holder has held the ADSs for more than one year as of the time such distribution is received. However, since we do not calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, it is
	expected that any distribution will be reported as a dividend, even if that distribution would otherwise be treated as a non-taxable return of capital or as capital gain under the rules described above. Non-corporate U.S. holders may qualify for the
	preferential rates of taxation with respect to dividends on ADSs applicable to long-term capital gains (i.e., gains from the sale of capital assets held for more than one year) applicable to qualified dividend income (as discussed below) if we are a
	&#147;qualified foreign corporation&#148; and certain other requirements (discussed below) are met. A non-United States corporation (other than a corporation that is classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the
	preceding taxable year) generally will be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (a)&nbsp;if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States which the Secretary of Treasury of the United States
	determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and which includes an exchange of information provision, or (b)&nbsp;with respect to any dividend it pays on ADSs which are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United
	States. The ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is an established securities market in the United States, and we expect the ADSs to be readily tradable on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. However, there can be no assurance that
	the ADSs will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States in the current taxable year or later years. The company, which is incorporated under the laws of France, believes that it qualifies as a resident

	A U.S. holder generally may claim the amount of any French withholding tax as either a deduction from gross income or a credit against U.S.
	federal income tax liability. However, the foreign tax credit is subject to numerous complex limitations that must be determined and applied on an individual basis. Generally, the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of a U.S. holder&#146;s
	U.S. federal income tax liability that such U.S. holder&#146;s taxable income bears to such U.S. holder&#146;s worldwide taxable income. In applying this limitation, a U.S. holder&#146;s various items of income and deduction must be classified,

	treated as a &#147;dividend&#148; may be lower for U.S. federal income tax purposes than it is for French income tax purposes, potentially resulting in a reduced foreign tax credit for the U.S. holder. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax

	In general, the amount of a distribution paid to a U.S. holder in a foreign currency will be the dollar
	value of the foreign currency calculated by reference to the spot exchange rate on the day the U.S. holder receives the distribution, regardless of whether the foreign currency is converted into U.S. dollars at that time. Any foreign currency gain
	or loss a U.S. holder realizes on a subsequent conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss. If dividends received in a foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars on the day they are received, a
	U.S. holder should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend.

	A U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the sale,&nbsp;exchange or other taxable disposition of ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar

	be a capital gain or loss. The adjusted tax basis in the ADSs generally will be equal to the cost of such ADSs. Capital gain from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of ADSs of a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally eligible for a
	preferential rate of taxation applicable to capital gains, if the non-corporate U.S. holder&#146;s holding period determined at the time of such sale, exchange or other taxable disposition for such ADSs exceeds one year (i.e., such gain is long-term
	taxable gain). The deductibility of capital losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitations under the Code. Any such gain or loss that a U.S. holder recognizes generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for foreign

	For a cash basis taxpayer, units of foreign currency paid or received are translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate
	on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. In that case, no foreign currency exchange gain or loss will result from currency fluctuations between the trade date and the settlement date of such a purchase or sale. An accrual basis taxpayer,
	however, may elect the same treatment required of cash basis taxpayers with respect to purchases and sales of the ADSs that are traded on an established securities market, provided the election is applied consistently from year to year. Such
	election may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. For an accrual basis taxpayer who does not make such election, units of foreign currency paid or received are translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the trade date of the purchase
	or sale. Such an accrual basis taxpayer may recognize exchange gain or loss based on currency fluctuations between the trade date and the settlement date. Any foreign currency gain or loss a U.S. Holder realizes will be U.S. source ordinary income

	Passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, gains from commodities
	and securities transactions, the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets which produce passive income, and includes amounts derived by reason of the temporary investment of funds raised in offerings of the ADSs. If a non-U.S.
	corporation owns directly or indirectly at least 25% by value of the stock of another corporation, the non-U.S. corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation and as
	receiving directly its proportionate share of the other corporation&#146;s income. If we are classified as a PFIC in any year with respect to which a U.S. holder owns the ADSs, we will continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S.

	The

	by how, and how quickly, we use the cash proceeds from the global offering in our business. Whether we are a PFIC for any taxable year will depend on our assets and income in each year, and because this is a factual determination made annually after
	the end of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC in any taxable year. Although it is not free from doubt, based on the composition of our income for our 2015 taxable year, we believe that we were not a

	Certain elections exist that may alleviate some of the adverse consequences of PFIC status and would result in an alternative treatment (such as
	mark-to-market treatment) of the ADSs. If a U.S. holder makes the mark-to-market election, the U.S. holder generally will recognize as ordinary income any excess of the fair market value of the ADSs at the end of each taxable year over their
	adjusted tax basis, and will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of any excess of the adjusted tax basis of the ADSs over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously
	included as a result of the mark-to-market election). If a U.S. holder makes the election, the U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in the ADSs will be adjusted to reflect these income or loss amounts. Any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of
	ADSs in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as an ordinary loss (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election). The
	mark-to-market election is available only if we are a PFIC and the ADSs are &#147;regularly traded&#148; on a &#147;qualified exchange.&#148; The ADSs will be treated as &#147;regularly traded&#148; in any calendar year in which more than a de
	minimis quantity of the ADSs are traded on a qualified exchange on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter (subject to the rule that trades that have as one of their principal purposes the meeting of the trading requirement as disregarded).
	The Nasdaq Global Select Market is a qualified exchange for this purpose and, consequently, if the ADSs are regularly traded, the mark-to-market election will be available to a U.S. holder.

	15%, or to 5% if such U.S. Holder is a corporation and owns directly or indirectly at least 10% of the share capital of the issuer; such U.S. Holder may claim a refund from the French tax authorities of the amount withheld in excess of the Treaty
	rates of 15% or 5%, if any.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For U.S. Holders that are not individuals but are U.S. residents, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, the
	requirements for eligibility for Treaty benefits, including the reduced 5% or 15% withholding tax rates contained in the &#145;&#145;Limitation on Benefits&#146;&#146; provision of the Treaty, are complicated, and certain technical changes were made
	to these requirements by the protocol of January&nbsp;13, 2009. U.S. Holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits in light of their own particular circumstances.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Dividends paid to an eligible U.S. Holder may immediately be subject to the reduced rates of 5% or 15% provided that such holder establishes before the date
	of payment that it is a U.S. resident under the Treaty by completing and providing the depositary with a treaty form (Form 5000). Dividends paid to a U.S. Holder that has not filed the Form 5000 before the dividend payment date will be subject to
	French withholding tax at the rate of 30%, or 75% if paid in a non-cooperative State or territory (as defined in Article 238-0 A of the FTC), and then reduced at a later date to 5% or 15%, provided that such holder duly completes and provides the
	French tax authorities with the treaty forms Form 5000 and Form 5001 before December&nbsp;31 of the second calendar year following the year during which the dividend is paid. Certain qualifying pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are
	subject to the same general filing requirements as other U.S. Holders except that they may have to supply additional documentation evidencing their entitlement to these benefits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Form 5000 and Form 5001, together with instructions, will be provided by the depositary to all U.S. Holders registered with the depositary. The depositary
	will arrange for the filing with the French Tax authorities of all such forms properly completed and executed by U.S. Holders of ordinary shares or ADSs and returned to the depositary in sufficient time so that they may be filed with the French tax
	authorities before the distribution in order to obtain immediately a reduced withholding tax rate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The withholding tax refund, if any, ordinarily occurs
	within 12 months from filing the applicable French Treasury Form, but not before January&nbsp;15 of the year following the calendar year in which the related dividend was paid.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In general, under the
	Treaty, a U.S. Holder who is a U.S. resident for purposes of the Treaty will not be subject to French tax on any capital gain from the redemption (other than redemption proceeds characterized as dividends under French domestic tax law or
	administrative guidelines), sale or exchange of ordinary shares or ADSs unless the ordinary shares or the ADSs form part of the business property of a permanent establishment or fixed base that the U.S. Holder has in France. Special rules apply to
	U.S. Holders who are residents of more than one country.

	We seek to engage in prudent management of our cash and cash equivalents, mainly cash on hand and common financial instruments (typically short-
	and mid-term deposits). Furthermore, the interest rate risk related to cash, cash equivalents and common financial instruments is not significant based on the quality of the financial institutions with which we work.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	are exposed to foreign exchange risk inherent in some of our supplies obtained in the United States, which have been invoiced in U.S. dollars. As of this date, we do not have revenues in dollars nor in any other currency other than the euro. Due to
	the relatively low level of these expenditures we believe our exposure to foreign exchange risk is unlikely to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position. Our exposure to currencies other than the U.S. dollar
	is negligible.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For 2013, 2014 and 2015, less than 10%, 7% and 7%, respectively, of our purchases and other external expenses have been made in U.S.
	dollars, generating a negligible net annual foreign exchange loss of &#128;3 thousands, &#128;24 thousands and &#128;7 thousands, respectively, for those periods. In light of these insignificant amounts, we have not adopted, at this stage, a hedging
	mechanism in order to protect our business activity against fluctuations in exchange rates. We cannot rule out the possibility that a significant increase in our business, particularly in the United States, may result in greater exposure to exchange
	rate risk and would then consider adopting an appropriate policy for hedging against these risks.

	As of this date, we do not believe that we are exposed to a short-term (12 months) liquidity risk, considering the cash and cash equivalents that we have
	available as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 of &#128;323.4&nbsp;million, which are mainly composed of cash and term deposits that are convertible into cash immediately without penalties in case of a need for cash.

	The depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally deducted from the cash being distributed. In the
	case of distributions other than cash (

	(whether certificated or uncertificated in direct registration), the depositary sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders. In the case of ADSs held in brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary generally collects its
	fees through the systems provided by DTC (whose nominee is the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians holding ADSs in their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who hold their clients&#146; ADSs in DTC

</I>

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
	under the Exchange Act) and for the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (
<I>
	principal executive officer
</I>
	) and chief
	operating officer (
<I>
	principal financial officer
</I>
	), management assessed our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
	Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, we concluded that we had a material weakness because we did not maintain adequate segregation of duties given the size of our finance and accounting team to allow for
	appropriate monitoring of financial reporting matters and internal control over financial reporting. We have limited accounting and financial reporting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures. The
	material weakness was partially remediated at December 31, 2015, but these new controls were not effective for almost all of 2015. Consequently, our chief executive officer (
<I>
	principal executive officer
</I>
	) and chief operating officer
	(
<I>
	principal financial officer
</I>
	) concluded that, due to this material weakness, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
	that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This material weakness
	did not result in any adjustments or restatements of our audited consolidated financial statements or disclosures for any prior period previously reported by the company. However, there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
	consolidated financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis due to the failure in designing and implementing appropriate controls over the segregation of duties, and therefore, it has been evaluated as a material
	weakness.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Notwithstanding this material weakness and management&#146;s assessment that internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, our management, including our chief executive officer (
<I>
	principal executive officer
</I>
	) and chief operating officer (
<I>
	principal financial officer

	As a French

</I>
	, we are subject to various
	corporate governance requirements under French law. In addition, as a foreign private issuer listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we are subject to the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. However, the Nasdaq Global Select
	Market&#146;s listing standards provide that foreign private issuers are permitted to follow home country corporate governance practices in lieu of Nasdaq rules, with certain exceptions. We currently rely on certain exemptions for foreign private
	issuers and follow French corporate governance practices in lieu of the Nasdaq corporate governance rules, including Nasdaq corporate governance rules that state (1)&nbsp;a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors;
	(2)&nbsp;establishing a nominating and corporate governance committee; (3)&nbsp;the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors; and (4)&nbsp;separate executive sessions of independent directors and non-management directors
	held by the company at least twice per year.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The following are the significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those
	required for U.S. companies listed on Nasdaq:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a foreign private issuer, we are required to comply with Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act relating to
	audit committee composition and responsibilities. Rule 10A-3 provides that the audit committee must have direct responsibility for the nomination, compensation and choice of our auditors, as well as control over the performance of their duties,
	management of complaints made, and selection of consultants. However, if the laws of a foreign private issuer&#146;s home country require that any such matter be approved by the board of directors or the shareholders, the audit committee&#146;s
	responsibilities or powers with respect to such matter may instead be advisory. Under French law, the audit committee may only have an advisory role and appointment of our statutory auditors, in particular, must be decided by the shareholders at our
	general shareholders&#146; meeting.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, Nasdaq rules require that a listed company specify that the quorum for any meeting of the holders of
	common stock be at least 33
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	1
</SUP>
	/
<SUB STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:BOTTOM">
	3
</SUB>
	% of the outstanding shares of the company&#146;s common voting stock. Consistent with French law, our
	by-laws provide that a quorum requires the presence of shareholders having at least (1)&nbsp;20% of the shares entitled to vote in the case of an ordinary shareholders&#146; general meeting or at an extraordinary shareholders&#146; general meeting
	where shareholders are voting on a capital increase by capitalization of reserves, profits or share premium, or (2)&nbsp;25% of the shares entitled to vote in the case of any other extraordinary shareholders&#146; general meeting. If a quorum is not
	present, the meeting is adjourned. There is no quorum requirement when an ordinary general meeting is reconvened, but the reconvened meeting may consider only questions which were on the agenda of the adjourned meeting. When an extraordinary general
	meeting is reconvened, the quorum required is 20% of the shares entitled to vote, except where the reconvened meeting is considering capital increases through capitalization of reserves, profits or share premium. For these matters, no quorum is
	required at the reconvened meeting. If a quorum is not present at a reconvened meeting requiring a quorum, then the meeting may be adjourned for a maximum of two months.

	We have audited DBV Technologies SA and its
	subsidiary&#146;s (the &#147;Company&#146;s&#148;) internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
	obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on that risk, and performing such
	other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company&#146;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company&#146;s
	board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
	dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
	(&#147;IFRS&#148;) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
	controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the
	risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
	possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management&#146;s
	assessment: the Company did not maintain adequate segregation of duties given the size of its finance and accounting team to allow for appropriate monitoring of financial reporting matters and internal control over financial reporting. The Company
	has limited accounting and financial reporting personnel and other resources with which to address its internal controls and procedures. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in
	our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, of the Company and this report does not affect our audit report on such financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness identified above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has
	not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
	Treadway Commission.

	Incorporated in 2002 under the laws
	of France, DBV Technologies S.A. (&#147;DBV Technologies,&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical-stage specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on changing the field of immunotherapy, specifically in young children.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company historically marketed a ready-to-use diagnostic product to detect t cow&#146;s milk protein allergy (&#147;CMPA&#148;) in children called
	Diallertest
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	Milk, which was launched in France in 2004. This product was distributed in France only, by a commercial partner, under a temporary exception status from French regulatory
	authorities which, without such temporary exception, marketing of the product would not be allowed. During the second half of 2015, the Company discontinued its commercial partnership with respect to the product and ceased selling Diallertest Milk.
	The Company does not expect to derive any revenues in 2016 from the sale of Diallertest Milk. DBV Technologies is also developing a novel technology platform called Viaskin
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	Company&#146;s therapeutic approach is based on epicutaneous immunotherapy, or EPIT, a proprietary method of delivering biologically active compounds to the immune system through intact skin using Viaskin.

	Peanut is the first specific immunotherapy product developed by DBV Technologies. Solid

	Welfare-Hospitals
</FONT>
	of Paris (L&#146;Assistance Publique&#151;Hopitaux de Paris), or AP-HP, and Universit&eacute; Paris-Descartes, or UPD, by which the Company agreed to terms
	of co-ownership with AP-HP and UPD of certain U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, referred to herein as the shared patents. The Company, and any licensees or sublicensees the Company designates, have the exclusive right to commercial
	uses of the shared patents. AP-HP and UPD agreed to use the shared patents only for internal research purposes and not to license the shared patents to any third party. Upon commercialization of any product covered by the shared patents, which the
	Company expects would include its Viaskin product candidates, the Company will be obligated to pay AP-HP and UPD a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty varies depending on the particular patent used in the product and is in the low
	single digits. Additionally, if the Company licenses any of the shared patents to a third party and a licensee commercializes products covered by such shared patents, the Company will be obligated to pay AP-HP and UPD a percentage in the low single
	digits of the money it receives from its licensee. If the Company does not sell any of its product candidates covered by the shared patents within 30 months from the date it first markets such product candidates, AP-HP may, upon six months&#146;
	notice and subject to certain exceptions, convert its exclusive right to the commercial use of the shared patents to a non-exclusive right. Any party may terminate the license in the event of another party&#146;s substantial breach which remains
	uncured after six months of receiving written notice of such breach. The agreement will also terminate in the event the Company ceases operations or is subject to a dissolution or bankruptcy proceedings. Absent early termination, the agreement will
	automatically terminate upon the expiration of the last shared patent. In the event the agreement is terminated, the Company would no longer have the exclusive right to commercial use of the shared patents, though it would retain its shared
	ownership rights. In addition, its ownership stake in certain jointly made improvements covered by the shared patents would survive termination of the agreement. The longest lived patent rights licensed to the Company under the agreement are
	currently expected to expire in 2028. To date, this agreement has not had an impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income going to the shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares
	outstanding during the course of the fiscal year. The weighted average number of shares was 13,604,687 in 2013. The weighted average number of shares was 16,086,247 in 2014. Taking into account the division of the nominal value of shares of the
	Company by 15, which was decided by the annual general meeting on December&nbsp;9, 2011 the amount of shares is adjusted, and multiplying it by 15, for all the outstanding shares presented. The weighted average number of shares was 21,522,342 in
	2015.

	The instruments that entitle their holders to a portion of the share capital on a deferred basis (BSAs, BSPCEs) are considered to be anti-dilutive
	(2,119,109 instruments in 2013, 1,437,684 instruments in 2014 and 2,033,768 instruments in 2015). These instruments are presented in detail in Note 17. Therefore, the diluted earnings per share are identical to the basic earnings per share.

	The Company is exposed to a

	the euro; the Company does not receive any full or partial mechanical endorsement. The exposure to currencies other than the U.S. dollar is negligible.

	For the fiscal years 2014 and 2015, less than 7% of the purchases and other external expenses had been made in U.S. dollars, generating a net annual foreign

	In light of these insignificant amounts,
	the Company has not adopted, at this stage, a hedging mechanism in order to protect its business activity against fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company cannot rule out the possibility that a significant increase in its business, particularly
	in the United States, may result in greater exposure to exchange rate risk and should thus consider adopting an appropriate policy for hedging against these risks.
