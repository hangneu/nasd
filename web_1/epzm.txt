	Epizyme is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and plans to commercialize novel epigenetic therapies for cancer patients. We
	are leaders in discovering and developing small molecule inhibitors of a class of enzymes known as histone methyltransferases, or HMTs. We are also expanding our development efforts beyond HMTs and are developing small molecule inhibitors of other
	chromatin modifying proteins, or CMPs. CMPs mediate selective and reversible modifications to chromatin, a complex of chromosomal DNA and histone proteins that controls gene expression. This chromatin remodeling and its resultant control of gene
	expression are part of a larger regulatory system, commonly referred to as epigenetics. Genetic alterations within CMPs or that indirectly affect CMPs can result in changes to their activity and drive multiple types of cancer, including
	hematological cancers and solid tumors. We believe that inhibiting altered CMPs presents the opportunity to create, develop and commercialize multiple targeted therapeutics.

	Our lead product candidate, tazemetostat, is a potent and selective inhibitor of the EZH2 HMT, an enzyme that plays an important role in various cancers. In
	our ongoing phase 1 clinical trial of tazemetostat in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, or in patients with advanced solid tumors, tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as a monotherapy, with an
	acceptable safety profile, in both NHL and in certain genetically-defined solid tumors. We are currently evaluating tazemetostat in a phase 2 study in adults with relapsed or refractory NHL, and one phase 2 study in adults and one phase 1 study in
	children with certain genetically-defined solid tumors. In addition, in mid-2016, we plan to initiate clinical trials of tazemetostat in combination with other therapies being used or investigated for the treatment of NHL. The first of these studies
	will test tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP, the standard of care front-line combination treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, an aggressive form of NHL, in front line elderly patients with DLBCL. We plan to initiate this
	study in the second quarter of 2016. The second of these studies will be conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, and will test tazemetostat in combination with either an anti-PD1 antibody or an anti-PDL1 antibody, which represent an
	important emerging class of biologic therapies and therapeutic candidates that enhance the body&#146;s immune response to cancer, and are commonly referred to as checkpoint inhibitors. We plan to enter into an arrangement with a collaboration
	partner for this study in the second quarter of 2016 and to initiate this study in mid-2016. In addition, we plan to initiate in the third quarter of 2016 a phase 2 study of tazemetostat in patients with mesothelioma characterized by
	loss-of-function of BAP1, an enzyme involved in EZH2 regulation. We are continuing to explore in preclinical testing other tumor types that may be sensitive to tazemetostat.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases
	characterized by uncontrolled cell division and growth. Cancerous cells that arise in the lymphatic system and bone marrow are referred to as hematological tumors. Cancer cells that arise in other tissues or organs are referred to as solid tumors.
	Researchers believe that exposure to some chemicals, viruses and various forms of radiation can cause genetic alterations that cause cancer. Genetic predispositions also can increase the risk of cancer in some people.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. The American Cancer Society estimated that in 2016 there
	will be approximately 1.7&nbsp;million new cases of cancer and approximately 596,000 deaths from cancer in the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The most common methods of
	treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination of these methods. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective in patients in whom the disease is
	localized. Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations in which the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The goal of drug therapy is to damage and kill cancer cells or to
	interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the development, growth and survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades,
	drug therapy has evolved from non-specific drugs that kill both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular pathways involved in cancer and more recently to therapeutics that target the specific oncogenic &#147;drivers&#148;
	of cancer.

	The earliest approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs,

	Cytosar-U and Cytoxan. While these drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, many unmet medical needs for the treatment of cancer remain. Also, cytotoxic drug therapies act in an indiscriminate manner, killing healthy as well as
	cancerous cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow dose range above which the toxicity causes unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage and below which the drugs are not effective in eradicating cancer cells.

	A more recent approach to pharmacological cancer treatment is to develop drugs that affect the drivers that cause uncontrolled growth of cancer cells because of a specific genetic alteration. In some cases, these agents

	to drug discovery. In this approach, clinical development involves the treatment of large populations from which a defined subpopulation that responds to treatment is identified. As a result, this approach can be time-consuming and costly, with

	Background of Epigenetics and Chromatin Remodeling.
</I>
</B>
	Epigenetics refers to a broad regulatory system that controls gene expression
	without altering the makeup of the genes themselves. Genes are composed of DNA, and in nature, this DNA is wrapped around a core of proteins known as histones. Together, the DNA and histone proteins form a complex known as chromatin that is the
	basic structural component of chromosomes. The structure of chromatin at specific gene locations can exist either in an open state that permits gene expression or in a more closed state that silences gene expression. The shifting of gene-specific
	chromatin structure&#151;from the open to the closed state, or the closed to open state&#151;is referred to as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin remodeling is affected by the reversible placement of small chemical groups&#151;acetyl groups, methyl
	groups and others&#151;onto specific sites on the DNA and the histone proteins, in concert with enzyme-catalyzed topographical changes to the contacts between DNA and histones. Some CMPs place these chemical groups onto specific sites on histones or
	DNA, some remove these marks in site-specific ways, others recognize the uniquely marked sites on histones and bind to these marked sites, and still other CMPs drive topographical changes to histone-DNA interactions within chromatin. Where, when and
	how such chromatin remodeling reactions occur, determines which genes in a cell are turned &#147;on&#148; or &#147;off&#148; at any particular time. When the function of these CMPs is altered, the program of gene expression is changed in ways that
	often leads to disease.

	Cancer and HMTs.
</I>
</B>
	We continue to focus the majority of our discovery efforts on the HMT class of CMPs as targets for
	cancer therapeutics. The HMT class is particularly attractive for drug therapy for several reasons. First, there are a large number of HMTs in humans&#151;96 in total&#151;because these enzymes are needed to conduct all of the methylation reactions
	at distinct locations within the histones. As a result, this class provides a large number of potential drug targets. Second, because HMTs regulate gene expression in a precise fashion, they provide the potential for creation of an inhibitor that
	can have a desired biological effect. Third, genome discovery efforts have demonstrated that the activity of many of the HMTs is changed due to genetic alterations in cancers in such a way as to make the individual cancers strongly dependent on the
	enzyme activity of specific HMTs, thereby potentially improving the likelihood that an inhibitor will have a therapeutic effect.

	Background on Cancers Characterized by Dysregulation of EZH2.
</I>
</B>
	EZH2 is an HMT that can become an oncogenic driver for NHL and a variety of other
	solid tumors, such as MRT, epithelioid sarcoma and MRTO. As a result, EZH2 has become an important target of oncological drug research.
</P>

<I>
	Non-Hodgkin
	Lymphoma.
</I>
	Two types of NHL, DLBCL of germinal-center origin and follicular lymphoma, or FL, are associated with oncogenic EZH2 mutations. In our preclinical studies, we observed that NHL cells were sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors such as
	tazemetostat and that NHL cells bearing EZH2 mutations were particularly responsive to such treatment. EZH2 plays a critical role at various stages in normal B-cell maturation, and a particularly critical role during the stage of B-cell development
	known as the germinal center reaction. Recent research has demonstrated that EZH2 acts as a critical gatekeeper for B-cell maturation and differentiation. Our own ongoing research suggests that it is a combination of stem like cell-of-origin
	together with specific genetic lesions that confers sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition to cancer cells. An analysis of patient samples with germinal center derived NHL has revealed a number of genetic alterations that impact EZH2 function in ways that
	may confer sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. While DLBCL and FL remain the primary target patient populations for tazemetostat, patients with other forms of NHL may also benefit from tazemetostat. Other genetic alterations that may impact EZH2
	function have been shown to exist in other forms of NHL and in solid tumors. These alterations include amplification of EZH2 and other PRC2 subunit genes, and loss-of-function mutations in histone acetyltransferases, members of the MLL gene family,
	the SWI/SNF complex and BAP1, and may confer sensitivity to an EZH2 inhibitor.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We estimate the annual incidence rate in the major pharmaceutical markets
	of DLBCL to be approximately 119,000 patients and the annual incidence rate of FL in the major markets to be approximately 36,000 patients. The 119,000 DLBCL patients include 89,000 patients with activated B-cell and non-germinal-center derived NHL
	and 30,000 patients with germinal-center DLBCL. We estimate that approximately 6,000 of the germinal-center DLBCL patients carry an EZH2 oncogenic point mutation and that approximately 6,000 of the FL patients carry an EZH2 oncogenic point mutation.
	Many patients with DLBCL and FL survive beyond the year in which they are diagnosed. Accordingly, we believe that the prevalence of DLBCL and FL in the major pharmaceutical markets is significantly higher than the annual incidence of 155,000
	patients. Common treatments for both DLBCL and FL are multi-agent chemotherapy, usually combined with rituximab (Rituxan), including R-CHOP

	and R-ICE and R-DHAP, along with other rituximab containing chemotherapy regimens, which are more often used as salvage regimens following the failure of front line treatment. R-CHOP and R-DHAP
	are combinations of the cancer agent rituximab, chemotherapy drugs and a steroid; R-ICE is a combination of rituximab and three chemotherapy drugs. Certain patients with DLBCL may also be treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

	According to published data from GBI Research, the value of the NHL market in the major developed markets is expected to increase to more than $9 billion by
	2020. While current therapies successfully treat more than 50% of DLBCL patients in the front line setting, there remains an unmet medical need in patients who have relapsed or are not responding to treatment. According to a review article published
	in the 2011 American Society of Hematology Education Book, after standard treatment, approximately one-third of DLBCL patients in a population based registry had refractory disease or had suffered a relapse within a median of four years. FL is
	generally considered to be incurable with existing therapies.

	Genetically- Defined Solid Tumors
</I>
	. INI1 and SMARCA4 are subunits of SWI/SNF, a
	chromatin modifying protein complex, which opposes the activity of PRC2, the complex within which EZH2 resides. Loss of INI1 or SMARCA4 in specific cell backgrounds is believed to cause dysregulation in the balance between SWI/SNF and PRC2, and thus
	cause tumors to become sensitive to EZH2 inhibition. This effect was observed in a preclinical study of tazemetostat in a xenograft model of MRT in which tazemetostat caused a dose dependent regression in INI1-negative tumors. INI1-negative tumors
	can appear in many different tissue types, and can present as MRT, epithelioid sarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumor, myoepithelial carcinoma and renal medullary carcinoma, among several others. SMARCA4-negative
	tumors can also appear as different tumor types, including MRTO. Synovial sarcoma is characterized by a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 18 and the X chromosome which leads to INI1 dysregulation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	INI1-negative or certain SMARCA4-negative tumors are typically aggressive cancers with few to no treatments approved for these tumors. For example, current
	treatment of MRT consists of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which are associated with limited efficacy and significant treatment-related morbidity in this population. INI1-negative tumors are most commonly seen in infants and toddlers,
	while SMARCA4-negative tumors and synovial sarcoma are most commonly seen in teenagers and young adults. We believe approximately 3,200 new patients with INI1-negative tumors, certain SMARCA4-negative tumors or synovial sarcoma are diagnosed
	annually in the United States and other major pharmaceutical markets; however, we believe that the actual number may be higher as these types of genetically-defined cancers are significantly under-reported today. MRTO accounts for less than 1% of
	all ovarian cancer diagnoses, with an average age of 24 years at diagnosis. MRTO is characterized by an aggressive clinical course with two year survival of less than 35%.

	The primary objective of the phase 1 study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tazemetostat and to
	determine the recommended dose for phase 2 trials. In the phase 1 trial, tazemetostat is being administered orally as a monotherapy, twice daily in continuous 28-day cycles. In the dose escalation portion of the study, patients were enrolled in one
	of five dose cohorts at dose levels of 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1600 mg twice daily. In the dose expansion portion of the study, patients received either 800 or 1600 mg twice daily. In the food effect portion of the study, patients received a single

	disease predominantly occurs in two different age ranges, an adult population and an infant/pediatric population. While they share a common genetic alteration, the adult disease is frequently a
	secondary leukemia resulting from prior chemotherapy for a different, unrelated cancer and the childhood disease is of unknown origin. MLL-r is caused by a chromosomal translocation involving the MLL gene. The translocation results in DOT1L being
	recruited to a specific place in the chromosome where it would not normally be present. As a result, DOT1L causes inappropriate histone methylation at this location, which results in the increased expression of genes involved in causing leukemia.
	There are no approved therapies specifically indicated for MLL-r. Physicians treat this hematological cancer with therapies approved for other acute leukemia. Patients with AML and ALL typically are treated with intensive multi-agent chemotherapy
	and high risk patients with ALL and AML who enter remission and have a matched donor often receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

	With respect to the first two of these elements, a common
	approach in drug discovery is to develop a small molecule drug candidate against a target which itself contains a genetic lesion that causes disease. This is exemplified among the CMPs by gain-of-function mutations within the HMT target EZH2 in
	subsets of germinal center lymphoma patients. However, through our combined CRISPR, cancer biology and chemical biology approaches, we have also revealed previously unrecognized synthetic lethal relationships affecting CMPs, wherein a genetic lesion
	that occurs at an unrelated gene product (protein) creates a unique dependency of a disease cell on the enzymatic activity of the CMP. This provides a novel approach to developing small molecule drugs that impact genetic lesions that were generally
	considered not amenable to drug development. For example, we have observed several cases in which pathogenic loss-of-function genetic lesions at one protein creates a unique reliance of a disease state on the enzymatic activity of a seemingly
	unrelated CMP, which can then be targeted for small molecule drug therapy. One example of this is the way in which INI deletions render certain cells sensitive to EZH2 inhibition.

	Deep Understanding of Target Biochemistry and Biology in the Context of Pathophysiology
</I>
	. Once a target is selected, we invest heavily in understanding
	the biochemistry and biology of that target in the context of cellular pathophysiology. Knowing how a CMP functions in the cell(s) of interest, details of its catalytic mechanism, which ancillary proteins bind to the target within the cell and
	impact activity, and its pattern of substrate utilization, all contribute importantly to our ability to create relevant biochemical and cellular assays for compound screening and evaluation.

<I>
	Comprehensive Molecular Discovery
</I>
	. We take a broad approach to drug discovery that includes an early emphasis on optimization of compounds by
	evaluating them against multiple criteria. Rather than focusing exclusively on target potency, we evaluate our chemical leads for a spectrum of pharmacological properties at an early point in the drug discovery process. Compounds are simultaneously
	optimized for target and cellular potency, drug-target residence time, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, or DMPK properties, and oral bioavailability. To accomplish this, we integrate a number of molecular science skill bases, together with
	biological sciences, to form comprehensive matrix discovery teams. These include: medicinal chemistry, enzymology, structural biology, biochemistry and biophysics and preclinical DMPK. We have also applied of comprehensive molecular discovery
	approach not only to individual targets, but also to target classes, such as the HMTs, through our cross-screening paradigm. In this manner, every compound designed by our chemists is screened against a large collection of representative enzymes of
	a target class. As a result, we have created a proprietary library of CMP-targeted compounds that today numbers over 32,000 compounds. We have also facilitated drug discovery by solving the co-crystal structures of over 700 CMPs in complex with our
	small molecule inhibitors. This has allowed us to develop a deep understanding of target class medicinal chemistry and has resulted in the creation of novel chemical starting points for targeted discovery programs.

<I>
	Early Integration of Preclinical and Clinical Development.
</I>
	We involve our preclinical and clinical teams early in the drug discovery process. We engage
	our clinicians and translational medicine experts during the target selection process to ensure that informed decisions are being made with respect to our five key elements of target selection. These researchers continue to participate in the
	program matrix teams to ensure early development of cogent approaches to clinical translation and development. For example, a clear understanding of patient population and their needs with respect to route of administration, dosing form, and dosing
	schedule, informs team decisions with respect to multi-parametric pharmacological optimization of lead compounds. Likewise, preclinical development expertise in chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, and safety assessment are engaged early
	in the discovery process to ensure successful transition of compounds from discovery through clinical evaluation.

	2014, we and GSK amended certain terms of this agreement for the third target, revising the license terms with respect to candidate compounds and amending the corresponding financial terms, including reallocating milestone payments and increasing
	royalty rates as to the third target. Additionally, as part of the research collaboration provided for in the agreement, we agreed to provide research and development services related to the licensed targets pursuant to agreed upon research plans
	during a research term that ended January&nbsp;8, 2015, or earlier if selection of a development candidate occurred.

	of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14
	years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar

	In January 2008, we entered into a license agreement with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, or UNC, to
	discover, develop and commercialize products utilizing specified inventions of UNC. Under the terms of the agreement, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide license under specified patent rights and a non-exclusive worldwide license under specified

	We do not have any manufacturing
	facilities and currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing
	approval. Prior to the execution of the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai, Eisai manufactured tazemetostat for preclinical and clinical development. Upon execution of the amended and restated collaboration and
	license agreement, as part of the transition plan, Eisai agreed to sell us its existing inventories and manufacture additional tazemetostat clinical supplies and the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API. We took receipt of these API and clinical
	supplies from Eisai during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. We have entered into clinical supply agreements with two contract manufacturers, one to produce tazemetostat API and one to produce tazemetostat tablets. We intend to identify and
	qualify additional manufacturers to provide API, tablets and a pediatric formulation as part of our ongoing manufacturing efforts for tazemetostat. To date, we have obtained materials for pinometostat from multiple third party manufacturers.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	All of our drug candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting
	materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead candidates are still in early clinical development. We
	generally expect to retain commercial rights in the United States for our product candidates for which we receive marketing approvals and have done so to date other than for the product candidates under our GSK collaboration and two of the three
	targets under our Celgene collaboration. We believe that it will be possible for us to access the United States oncology market through a focused, specialized sales force.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the
	United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed.
	Outside the United States, we may choose to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval, or may choose to commercialize our products in certain markets,
	depending upon many factors, including the target market size, availability of reimbursement, and our financial resources at the time.

	Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated
	if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or
	other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete
	may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and

	The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for

	to these therapies, our product candidates will not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are

	Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human
	subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical
	trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent
	protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the
	IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on the
	ClinicalTrials.gov website.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In phase 1, the
	drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its
	effectiveness. In phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to
	determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to
	statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In phase 4, post-approval studies may be
	conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Progress reports detailing the results of
	the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 and phase 4 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all.
	Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate
	approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In general, the FDA accepts foreign safety and efficacy studies that were not conducted under an IND provided that they are well designed, well conducted,
	performed by qualified investigators, and conducted in accordance with ethical principles acceptable to the world community. The conduct of these studies must meet at least minimum standards for assuring human subject protection. Therefore, for
	studies submitted in support of an NDA that were conducted outside the United States and not under an IND, the agency requires demonstration that such studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices.

	The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing,
	to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information.
	The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether
	the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s continued safety, quality and purity.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA typically refers a question regarding a novel drug to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts,
	including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory
	committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or
	facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the
	product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data
	obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the
	manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to
	secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does
	not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with

	Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval
	Programs.
</I>
</B>
	The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs
	that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under
	standard FDA review procedures.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is
	intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none
	exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA regarding drug development and may submit sections of
	a fast track product&#146;s NDA before the application is complete.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in
	treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and
	ten month review periods are measured from the &#147;filing&#148; date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of
	submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the
	basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than
	irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or
	lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality
	or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug
	Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#147;breakthrough therapy.&#148; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in
	combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more
	clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding
	timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.

	service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements
	between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution,
	the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or
	safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#146;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.

	Coverage and Reimbursement.

	The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to
	commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for
	our therapeutic product candidates and related companion diagnostics. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for
	healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs)
	provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate
	the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in
	the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of
	operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in
	general.

	Third party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical
	products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products.
	Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost
	containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to

	Impact of Healthcare Reform on
	Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing.
</I>
</B>
	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under
	Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug
	coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its
	own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all
	the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for
	any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies
	only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar
	reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

	A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the

	IND and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s
	approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for
	which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

	Hatch-Waxman Patent Exclusivity.
</I>
</B>
	In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with
	claims that cover the applicant&#146;s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#146;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic
	Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of
	administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	or
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical
	tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#147;generic equivalents&#148; to the listed drug, and can often be
	substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.

	A 505(b)(2) application applies to a drug for which the

	right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.&#148; As with an ANDA, Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the

	Generally, the ANDA
	or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product&#146;s
	listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or
	505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

	If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA

	holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification
	automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

	Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of
	ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical
	entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an
	ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical
	investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a
	previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general
	matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an
	applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

	Orphan Drug Exclusivity.
</I>
</B>
	The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions,
	which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the
	product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. A drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug
	exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the
	product with exclusivity. We intend to seek orphan drug designation and exclusivity for our products whenever it is available.

	Pediatric Exclusivity.

</B>
	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United
	States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan drug exclusivity periods described above. This six-month
	exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the
	clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#146;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or
	regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or
	505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any of our products is approved, we anticipate seeking pediatric exclusivity when it is appropriate.

	In order to

	commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical
	trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other
	countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may
	negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

	Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials

	each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable
	opinion. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without
	the need for any national implementing legislation, and will become applicable no earlier than 28&nbsp;May 2016. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a
	single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in
	more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials.

	such as heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, the European Medicines Agency,

	of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt
	of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#146;s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the
	assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. For the EMA, a Pediatric
	Investigation Plan, or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting an MAA for use for drugs in pediatric populations.

	marketing authorization can be submitted but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an
	authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered
	to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete human clinical
	trial database and obtain marketing approval of its product.

	The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the
	development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the
	drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify developing the
	drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant
	benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free protocol assistance, fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedures before and during the first year after marketing authorization and 10 years of
	market exclusivity following drug approval. Fee reductions are not limited to the first year after authorization for small and medium enterprises. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met,
	including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

	Our research and development is focused on the creation of novel epigenetic therapies for cancer patients, which is a rapidly evolving area of science,
	and the approach we are taking to discover and develop drugs is novel and may never lead to marketable products.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The discovery of novel
	epigenetic therapies for cancer patients is an emerging field, and the scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop product candidates are relatively new. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of
	developing product candidates based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. Although epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays an essential role in biological function, few drugs premised on epigenetics have been discovered.
	Moreover, those drugs based on an epigenetic mechanism that have received marketing approval are in different target classes than HMTs, where our research and development is principally focused. Although preclinical studies suggest that genetic
	alterations can result in changes to the activity of HMTs, making them oncogenic, to date no company has translated these biological observations into systematic drug discovery that has yielded a drug that has received marketing approval. We believe
	that we are the first company to conduct a clinical trial of an HMT inhibitor. Therefore, we do not know if our approach of inhibiting HMTs to treat cancer patients will be successful.

	A key element of our strategy is to use and expand our proprietary drug discovery platform to build a pipeline of small molecule inhibitors of
	HMT and other CMP targets and progress these product candidates through clinical development for the treatment of a variety of different types of cancer. Although our research and development efforts to date have resulted in a pipeline of programs
	directed to specific HMT and other CMP targets, we may not be able to develop product candidates that are safe and effective CMP inhibitors. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we
	identify may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve
	market acceptance. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our technological approach, we will not be able to obtain product revenues in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our

	Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur

	Two of our product candidates are in clinical development, and our remaining product candidates are in preclinical development. The risk of failure for each
	of our product candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for
	the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Product candidates are subject to continued preclinical safety studies, which may be conducted concurrent with our clinical testing. The outcomes of these
	safety studies may delay the launch of or enrollment in future clinical studies. For example, in the course of our preclinical safety studies of tazemetostat, we observed the development of lymphoma in Sprague Dawley rats. We informed the relevant
	international regulatory authorities, the FDA and the clinical investigators of this finding in rats, and discussed the results with the regulatory authorities. In August 2015, the FDA accepted our IND for tazemetostat in patients with INI1-negative
	tumors or synovial sarcoma, and in December 2015, the FDA accepted our IND for tazemetostat in patients with DLBCL. Expansion of our development of tazemetostat outside of these indications in the United States, including mesothelioma characterized
	by BAP1 loss-of-function, will require that we submit an IND or that we submit supplemental materials to the FDA and that we address this matter to the satisfaction of the FDA within the context of patient risk-benefit and in view of the safety and
	efficacy data from our ongoing and completed clinical trials of tazemetostat. If we are unable to adequately address this matter, we may be unable to conduct clinical trials of tazemetostat in patients with other cancers in the United States, our
	trials may be limited to certain patient populations or our ability to conduct other trials in the United States may be delayed.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Clinical testing is
	expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials
	may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. For example, the complete responses that were observed in two patients with MLL-r in the fourth dose
	cohort of the dose escalation portion of our phase 1 clinical trial of pinometostat were not achieved by any other patient treated with pinometostat in the phase 1 clinical trial. We voluntarily ceased patient enrollment into the phase 1 clinical
	trial in adult patients with MLL-r due to insufficient evidence of efficacy of pinometostat as a monotherapy in the third quarter of 2015. We are continuing to conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial of pinometostat in pediatric patients with MLL-r.
	Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have
	nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.

	payments and royalties at a percentage in the mid-teens on worldwide net sales of any EZH2 product, excluding net sales in Japan. In addition, we are responsible for solely funding global development, manufacturing and commercialization costs for

	To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing, and eventually

	product candidates, discovering additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the
	preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated
	with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA,
	or other regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.

	The regulations that govern marketing approvals,
	pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in
	obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets,
	prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price
	regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our
	ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our ability to
	commercialize any product candidates successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities,
	private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A
	primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications.
	Increasingly, third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any
	product that we commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. Reimbursement may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and
	maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and
	adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is
	approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development,
	manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the
	clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates
	required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third party payors often rely
	upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products
	that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.

	In the United States,

	term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term
	of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions for

	We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third party CROs to
	assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate&#146;s
	safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be
	effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. For example, we
	voluntarily ceased patient enrollment in our phase 1 clinical trial of pinometostat in adult patients with MLL-r due to insufficient evidence of efficacy with monotherapy treatment. New cancer drugs frequently are indicated only for patient

	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate

	population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. We have obtained orphan drug designations in the United States and Europe for pinometostat for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such
	designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United
	States and ten years in Europe. The exclusivity period in Europe can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer
	justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the
	rare disease or condition.

	Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from

	clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the

	new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic is not also approved or cleared for that indication. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices, and the FDA has generally

	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
	Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average
	sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could
	decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own
	reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare

	In some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental

	As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other
	expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public
	companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance
	initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.

	We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to continue to operate as a public company, nor can we predict the timing of such
	costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and
	governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.

	Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section&nbsp;404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal
	control over financial reporting. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we are not required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To
	achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue
	to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate,
	validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an
	adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.

	Overview

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and plans to commercialize novel epigenetic therapies for cancer patients. Our lead
	product candidate, tazemetostat, is a potent and selective inhibitor of the EZH2 HMT, an enzyme that plays an important role in various cancers. In our ongoing phase 1 clinical trial of tazemetostat in patients with relapsed or refractory
	non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, or in patients with advanced solid tumors, tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as a monotherapy, with an acceptable safety profile. We are currently evaluating tazemetostat in two phase 2 studies in
	adults and one phase 1 study in children. In addition, in mid-2016, we plan to initiate clinical trials of tazemetostat in combination with other therapies being used or investigated for the treatment of NHL. The first of these studies will test
	tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP, the standard of care front-line combination treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL in front line elderly patients with DLBCL. We plan to initiate this study in the second quarter of 2016. The
	second of these studies will be conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, and will test tazemetostat in combination with either an anti-PD1 antibody or anti-PDL1 antibody, which represent an important emerging class of biologic
	therapies and therapeutic candidates that enhance the body&#146;s immune response to cancer. We plan to enter into an arrangement with a collaboration partner for this study in the second quarter of 2016 and to initiate this study in mid-2016. In
	addition, we plan to initiate a phase 2 study of tazemetostat in patients with mesothelioma characterized by loss-of-function of BAP1, an enzyme involved in EZH2 regulation, in the third quarter of 2016. We are continuing to explore in preclinical
	testing other tumor types that may be sensitive to tazemetostat. We have entered into an agreement with Roche for the development of a companion diagnostic for use with tazemetostat to identify NHL patients with EZH2 point mutations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan. Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, holds the rights to develop and
	commercialize tazemetostat in Japan, and holds a limited right of first negotiation for the rest of Asia.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have several additional programs in
	development, including a clinical program of pinometostat, an inhibitor of the DOT1L HMT, for the treatment of children with MLL-r, an acute leukemia with genetic alterations of the MLL gene. Under our collaboration with Celgene, we own
	commercialization rights to pinometostat in the United States and Celgene owns commercialization rights to pinometostat outside the United States. Along with Celgene, we are also investigating in preclinical studies combinations of pinometostat with
	other targeted therapies for the treatment of adults with MLL-r.

	We have additional small molecule HMT inhibitors that are being developed under our
	collaborations with Glaxo Group Limited (an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline), or GSK, and Celgene. Under our collaboration with GSK, GSK is developing small molecule inhibitors against three novel HMT targets including PRMT5. We discovered these HMT
	inhibitors using our proprietary drug discovery platform and successfully delivered them to GSK under the collaboration. GSK has worldwide rights to the inhibitors of these three HMT targets. Under our collaboration with Celgene, we are developing

	Collaboration revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 decreased $38.8 million as compared to the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014, primarily as a result of the completion of a significant portion of our performance obligations under our collaborations during 2014 and achievement of a $3.0 million milestone under our agreement with GSK during 2014.

	Collaboration revenue decreased $27.1 million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of $35.0 million of
	milestone payments recognized in 2013 related to the Celgene, GSK and Eisai collaborations, partially offset by higher research revenues associated with the GSK agreement in 2014. In 2013, we recognized milestone revenue of $25.0 million from
	Celgene related to achieving a proof of concept milestone for pinometostat, $4.0 million for achievement of two preclinical milestones with GSK and $6.0 million from Eisai for achieving a clinical milestone related to the development of

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, all of our deferred revenue related to our Celgene collaboration. The recognition of deferred revenue under
	the amended and restated Celgene agreement is largely dependent on the future development of the non-pinometostat targets that are subject to the collaboration, as $28.8 million of the $30.7 million of total deferred revenue as of December&nbsp;31,
	2015 relates to the non-pinometostat targets. We do not expect to recognize any of the remaining $28.8 million of deferred revenue as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 related to the three non-pinometostat targets for the next several years, unless or until
	Celgene exercises their option rights

	Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including
	clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, fees paid to third party clinical research organizations, or CROs, compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, and
	other outside expenses. As we advance our product platform, we are conducting research on several prioritized HMT targets. Our research and development team is organized such that the strategy, design, management and evaluation of results of all of
	our research and development plans is accomplished internally while some of our research and development activities are executed using our multinational network of CROs. In the early phases of development, our research and development costs are
	often devoted to enhancing our product platform and are not necessarily allocable to specific targets. In circumstances where our collaboration and license agreements provide for equally co-funded global development under joint risk sharing
	collaborations, amounts received from collaboration partners for such co-funding are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Most of
	our research and development costs are external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis. Our internal research and development costs are primarily compensation expenses for our full-time research and development employees, including
	stock-based compensation expense. By employing a multinational network of CROs, our employees are able to dedicate significant amounts of their time to the expansion and development of our product platform while managing the research performed by
	our CROs.

	During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 total research and development expenses increased by $35.6 million,
	primarily due to the $40.0 million upfront payment that we made to Eisai to reacquire the worldwide rights, excluding Japan, to the EZH2 program, including tazemetostat, and the related costs to accelerate the development of tazemetostat. These cost
	increases were partially offset by reduced spending on pinometostat and related DOT1L programs and on our discovery and preclinical programs. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, total research and development expenses increased by $18.0
	million, compared to 2013, primarily due to the expansion of our product platform and the advancement of our preclinical pipeline programs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	External
	research and development expenses for tazemetostat during 2015 include the costs associated with our reacquisition of worldwide rights, excluding Japan, to the EZH2 program, including tazemetostat, from Eisai during the first quarter of 2015. We are
	now solely responsible for funding the development, manufacturing, and commercialization costs for EZH2 compounds outside of Japan, including tazemetostat. Accordingly, external research and development expenses for tazemetostat for 2015 include
	phase 1/2 clinical trial costs, discovery and preclinical research in support of the tazemetostat program, expenses associated with our companion diagnostic program, and external manufacturing costs related to the acquisition of active
	pharmaceutical ingredient and manufacturing of clinical drug supply. In 2014 and 2013, external research and development expenses of $3.8 million and $3.9 million for tazemetostat related to the phase 1 clinical trial costs and exploratory research
	costs incurred pursuant to our original agreement with Eisai.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	External research and development expenses for pinometostat for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 decreased by $9.9 million compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The decline in program spending in 2015 reflects reduced enrollment in the pinometostat adult and pediatric clinical trials and the associated
	reduction in costs to support the preclinical and research programs. We ceased enrollment in our pinometostat adult phase 1 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2015. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, external research and development
	expenses for pinometostat and related DOT1L programs increased by $1.9 million to $15.2 million, due to the advancement of the pinometostat phase 1 clinical trial. Research and development expenses for pinometostat for the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are net of $1.1 million, $3.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of global development co-funding from Celgene.

	External research and development expenses for discovery and preclinical stage product programs decreased by $15.2 million for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. This decrease reflects our reallocation of resources to support the expansion of the tazemetostat programs and our reprioritization of our discovery and preclinical
	development programs. External research and development expenses for discovery and preclinical stage product programs, including the three target programs partnered with GSK, increased $9.1 million to $31.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This
	increase reflects our advancement of the research and development of these programs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Internal research and development expenses increased by $1.4 million

	expansion of our internal clinical development team to support ongoing and new clinical programs and evaluations of tazemetostat, drug manufacturing, and regulatory filings following the reacquisition of tazemetostat from Eisai. Internal research
	and development costs increased in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to an increase in research headcount and related compensation costs.

	After adjusting for
	the in-process research and development payment made to Eisai of $40.0 million that is included as a component of research and development expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we expect that research and development expenses will
	increase in 2016, when compared to 2015. The expected increase is primarily driven by the costs of our ongoing and planned clinical trials, including our five-arm phase 2 study in NHL, our phase 2 study in certain genetically-defined solid tumors,
	our phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study of pediatric patients with certain genetically-defined solid tumors, our planned phase 1b/2 mesothelioma study and our planned NHL combination studies. In addition, discovery and preclinical

	Because our product candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate

	Based on our research and development
	plans and our timing expectations related to the progress of our programs, we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 together with the proceeds from our offering of common stock in January 2016, will be
	sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of 2017, without giving effect to any potential option exercise fees or milestone payments we may receive under our collaboration agreements. We
	have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, particularly as the process of testing drug candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain. As a result, we could use our capital
	resources sooner than we expect.

	payments and $18.2 million in research reimbursements, as compared to the receipt in 2013 of $16.0 million in non-equity funding under our collaborations, offset by increased spend in our research and development and general and administrative

	We recognize revenue when all

	collaboration and license agreements typically contain multiple deliverables, which may include licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to compounds directed to specific HMT targets, referred to as exclusive licenses, as well as research and
	development activities to be performed by us on behalf of the collaboration partner related to the licensed HMT targets. Payments that we may receive under these agreements include non-refundable license fees, option fees, extension fees, payments

	Multiple-Element Revenue Arrangements
</I>
	. Our collaborations primarily represent multiple-element revenue arrangements. To account for these transactions,
	we determine the elements, or deliverables, included in the arrangement and allocate arrangement consideration to the various elements based on each element&#146;s relative selling price. The identification of individual elements in a
	multiple-element arrangement and the estimation of the selling price of each element involve significant judgment, including consideration as to whether each delivered element has standalone value to the collaborator. We determine the estimated
	selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if available, or third party evidence of selling price if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or our best estimate of
	selling price, if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. We typically use our best estimate of selling price
	to estimate the selling price for licenses to our proprietary technology, since we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where we apply our best
	estimate of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as
	well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating
	our best estimate of selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine our best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between deliverables. We
	recognize consideration allocated to an individual element when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element.

	The accounting for option

	the options, the cost to exercise the options relative to the total upfront consideration and the additional financial commitments or economic penalties imposed on the collaborator as a result of exercising the options. For arrangements under which

	Research and

	to clinical research organizations and other outside expenses. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred if no planned alternative future use exists for the technology and if the payment is not payment for future services. The Company

<I>
	Revenue From Contracts With Customers
</I>
	. ASU 2014-09 amends Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition

	,
	by outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for us for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. We are
	evaluating the impact that this ASU may have on our consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15,
<I>
	Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
</I>
	. ASU 2014-15 amends ASC 205-40,
<I>
	Presentation of Financial Statements&#151;Going Concern
</I>
	, by providing guidance on determining when and how
	reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements, including requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the
	date of issuance of the entity&#146;s financial statements and providing certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 will be effective for us for annual periods ending
	after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The adoption of this standard may affect our disclosures in future periods.

	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, &#147;Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes&#148;, which simplifies the presentation of deferred
	income taxes. This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a statement of financial position. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016,
	including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. We early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective December&nbsp;31, 2015, on a prospective basis.
	Because we are in a full valuation allowance, the adoption of this standard did not impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.

	The market risk inherent in our financial instruments and in our financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest
	rates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash equivalents of $197.0 million consisting of interest-bearing money market accounts and prime money market funds. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by
	changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Due to the short-term maturities of our cash equivalents and the low risk profile of these investments, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates at levels as of December&nbsp;31, 2015
	would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash equivalents.

	We contract with CROs and manufacturers internationally. Transactions
	with these providers are predominantly settled in U.S. dollars and, therefore, we believe that we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks. We do not hedge against foreign currency risks.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Epizyme, Inc. (the Company) as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the
	related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows and redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders&#146; (deficit) equity, for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These
	financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
	the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
	Epizyme, Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
	principles.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Epizyme, Inc. (collectively referred to with its wholly owned, controlled subsidiary, Epizyme Securities Corporation, as &#147;Epizyme&#148;
	or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and plans to commercialize novel epigenetic therapies for cancer patients. The Company&#146;s lead product candidate, tazemetostat, is a potent and
	selective inhibitor of the EZH2 HMT, an enzyme that plays an important role in various cancers. The Company owns the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan. Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, holds the rights to
	develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan, and holds a limited right of first negotiation for the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company has additional programs
	in development, including pinometostat, a clinical program that is subject to a collaboration with Celgene Corporation and Celgene RIVOT Ltd., an affiliate of Celgene Corporation, which we collectively refer to as &#147;Celgene&#148; (refer to Note
	9,
<I>
	Collaborations
</I>
	), three preclinical programs for small molecule HMT inhibitors that are subject to a collaboration with Glaxo Group Limited, an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline (&#147;GSK&#148;), three preclinical programs for small molecule
	HMT inhibitors that are subject to a collaboration with Celgene (refer to Note 9,
<I>
	Collaborations
</I>
	), and five novel targets where the Company retains worldwide global development and commercialization rights.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has raised an aggregate of $592.1 million to fund operations, of which $201.6 million was non-equity funding
	through collaboration agreements, $314.5 million was from the sale of common stock in public offerings and $76.0 million was from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had $208.3 million in
	cash and cash equivalents. In addition, in January 2016, the Company raised an additional $130.1 million of net proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions, but before direct and incremental costs of the offering, upon the sale of
	15,333,334 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock in a public offering. As this event occurred in fiscal 2016, it is not reflected in the December&nbsp;31, 2015 financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company commenced active operations in early 2008. Since its inception, the Company has generated an accumulated deficit of $243.5 million through
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and will require substantial additional capital to fund its research and development. The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, risks of failure of
	preclinical studies and clinical trials, the need to obtain additional financing to fund the future development of tazemetostat and the rest of its pipeline, the need to obtain marketing approval for its product candidates, the need to successfully
	commercialize and gain market acceptance of its product candidates, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, development by competitors of technological innovations and ability to
	transition from pilot-scale manufacturing to large-scale production of products.

	The Company classifies fair value based measurements using a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure
	fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1, quoted market prices in active markets
	for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 such as quoted market prices for markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
	market data; and Level 3, unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and
	similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

	Multiple-Element Revenue Arrangements.
</I>
</B>
	The Company&#146;s collaborations primarily represent
	multiple-element revenue arrangements. To account for these transactions, the Company determines the elements, or deliverables, included in the arrangement and allocates arrangement consideration to the various elements based on each element&#146;s
	relative selling price. The identification of individual elements in a multiple-element arrangement and the estimation of the selling price of each element involves significant judgment, including consideration as to whether each delivered element
	has standalone value to the collaborator. The Company determines the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;) of selling price, if available, or third party evidence
	of selling price if VSOE is not available, or the Company&#146;s best estimate of selling price, if neither VSOE nor third party evidence is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment.
	The Company typically uses its best estimate of a selling price to estimate the selling price for licenses to its proprietary technology, since it often does not have VSOE or third party evidence of selling price for these deliverables. In those
	circumstances where the Company applies its best estimate of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to its proprietary technology, it considers market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those
	factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a
	product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its best estimate of selling price, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the
	allocation of arrangement consideration between deliverables. The Company recognizes consideration allocated to an individual element when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element.

	&#151;The deliverables under the Company&#146;s collaboration agreements generally include exclusive licenses to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize compounds with respect to
	one or more specified HMT targets. To account for this element of the arrangement, management evaluates whether the exclusive license has standalone value from the undelivered elements to the collaboration partner based on the consideration of the
	relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner. The Company may recognize arrangement consideration allocated to licenses upon delivery of the license if facts
	and circumstances indicate that the license has standalone value from the undelivered elements, which generally include research and development services. The Company defers arrangement consideration allocated to licenses if facts and circumstances
	indicate that the delivered license does not have standalone value from the undelivered elements. The Company has determined that certain of its exclusive licenses lack standalone value apart from the related research and development services and is
	therefore recognizing collaboration revenue from non-refundable exclusive license fees on a straight-line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance, which is generally the period over which the research and development services
	are to be provided.

	The accounting for option arrangements is dependent on the nature of the options granted to the

	Company considers in evaluating whether options are substantive include the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the options, the cost to exercise the options
	relative to the total upfront consideration and the additional financial commitments or economic penalties imposed on the collaborator as a result of exercising the options. For arrangements under which the option to secure licenses is considered

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) No.&nbsp;2014-09,
<I>
	Revenue From Contracts With Customers
</I>
	. ASU 2014-09 amends Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 605,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition

	from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for us for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact that this ASU may have on the consolidated financial statements.

	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15,
<I>
	Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity&#146;s
	Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
</I>
	. ASU 2014-15 amends ASC 205-40,
<I>
	Presentation of Financial Statements&#151;Going Concern
</I>
	, by providing guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties
	in their financial statements, including requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity&#146;s financial statements and
	providing certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 will be effective for the Company for annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and interim periods
	within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The adoption of this standard may affect the Company&#146;s disclosures in future periods.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, &#147;Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes&#148;, which simplifies the presentation of deferred
	income taxes. This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a statement of financial position. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016,
	including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective December&nbsp;31, 2015, on a
	prospective basis. Because the Company is in a full valuation allowance, the adoption of this standard did not impact the presentation of the consolidated financial statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively
	adjusted.

	The Company evaluated the expected recoverability of its net deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and
	2014 and determined that there was insufficient positive evidence to support the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets, concluding it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets would not be realized in the future; therefore
	the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset balance as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. The valuation allowance increased by $51.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had operating loss carryforwards of approximately $204.7 million and $206.5 million available to offset future
	taxable income for United States federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The U.S. federal tax operating loss carryforwards expire commencing in 2029. The state tax operating loss carryforwards expire commencing in 2031. Additionally, as
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015 the Company had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5.3 million and $1.7 million available to be used as a reduction of federal income taxes and state income taxes, respectively, which expire
	at various dates from 2024 through 2035, as well as federal orphan drug tax credit carryforwards of $11.0 million, which would expire at various dates from 2033 through 2035, and a $0.4 million federal alternative minimum tax credit. The federal tax
	credit carryforwards include approximately $0.4 million related to excess tax benefits, which have been included in the gross deferred tax asset reflected for research and development and other credit carryforwards. This amount will be recorded as
	an increase to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet when the excess benefits are realized. The Company&#146;s ability to use its operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset future taxable income is subject to
	restrictions under Section&nbsp;382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Internal Revenue Code&#148;). These restrictions may limit the future use of the operating loss carryforwards and tax credits if certain ownership changes described in
	the Internal Revenue Code occur. Future changes in stock ownership may occur that would create further limitations on the Company&#146;s use of the operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. In such a situation, the Company may be required to pay
	income taxes, even though significant operating loss carryforwards and tax credits exist.

	Prior to the completion of its IPO in 2013, the Company had outstanding Series A, Series B and Series C redeemable convertible preferred

	market participants, would have the ability to execute human clinical trials on the identified compound. After an IND filing, the remaining research services represent a separate unit of accounting which has standalone value upon delivery. With
	respect to the third Option Target where the Company retains U.S. rights, because the license terms restrict Celgene&#146;s access to information through the completion of a phase 1 trial that would otherwise be necessary for Celgene, or other

	Because Celgene&#146;s option rights with respect to the Option Targets are not

	The allocable arrangement consideration has been allocated to the identified deliverables using the relative selling price method. The Company estimated the
	selling price of the license deliverable for each Option Target using management&#146;s best estimate of selling price after considering potential future cash flows under each license and industry benchmarks on the probability of achieving
	development milestones. The Company then discounted these probability-weighted cash flows to their present value. The Company estimated the selling price of the research services to be provided in connection with the DOT1L phase 1 clinical trial and
	related to each Option Target using management&#146;s best estimate of selling price based on the Company&#146;s estimated cost of providing the services plus an applicable profit margin of 10%, which is commensurate with observable market data for

	Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has recognized $72.4 million of total collaboration revenue since
	the inception of the collaboration, including $1.1 million, $9.6 million and $37.8 million in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $1.1 million, $3.9 million and $1.9 million of total global development co-funding

	In January 2011, the Company
	entered into a collaboration and license agreement with GSK, to discover, develop and commercialize novel small molecule HMT inhibitors directed to available targets from the Company&#146;s platform. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
	granted GSK exclusive worldwide license rights to HMT inhibitors directed to three targets. Additionally, as part of the research collaboration, the Company agreed to provide research and development services related to the licensed targets pursuant
	to agreed upon research plans during a research term that ended January&nbsp;8, 2015. In March 2014, the Company and GSK amended certain terms of this agreement for the third licensed target, revising the license terms with respect to candidate
	compounds and amending the corresponding financial terms, including reallocating milestone payments and increasing royalty rates as to the third target. The Company substantially completed all research obligations under this agreement by the end of
	the first quarter of 2015 and completed the transfer of the remaining data and materials for these programs to GSK in the second quarter of 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the agreement, the Company
	recorded a $20.0 million upfront payment, a $3.0 million payment upon the execution of the March 2014 agreement amendment, $6.0 million of fixed research funding, $15.0 million of preclinical research and development milestone payments and $9.0
	million for research and development services. The Company is eligible to receive up to $18.0 million in additional preclinical research and development milestone payments, up to $109.0 million in clinical development milestone payments, up to
	$275.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $218.0 million in sales-based milestone payments. In addition, GSK is required to pay the Company royalties, at percentages from the mid-single digits to the low double-digits, on a licensed
	product-by-licensed product basis, on worldwide net product sales, subject to reduction in specified circumstances. Due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug
	development, the Company may not receive any additional milestone payments or royalty payments from GSK. Due to the varying stages of development of each licensed target, the Company is not able to determine the next milestone that might be achieved
	under this agreement, if any. GSK became solely responsible for development and commercialization for each licensed target in the collaboration when the research term ended on January&nbsp;8, 2015.

	For each selected target in the collaboration, the Company was primarily responsible for research
	until the earlier of the selection of a development candidate for the target or January&nbsp;8, 2015, and GSK is solely responsible for subsequent development and commercialization. GSK provided a fixed amount of research funding during the second
	and third years of the research term. GSK was obligated to provide research funding equal to 100.0% of research and development costs, subject to specified limitations, during the fourth year of the research term.

	The significant deliverables of this multiple-element revenue arrangement were determined to be exclusive
	licenses to three targets and corresponding research services for each target. At the inception of the arrangement, the Company concluded that the licenses could not be used for their intended purpose without the highly specialized skills and
	know-how relating to HMT inhibitors that is only available from the Company. The Company therefore concluded that the target licenses lacked standalone value apart from the related research services due to the limited economic benefit that GSK would
	derive from the licenses if it did not obtain the Company&#146;s research services and due to the lack of transferability of the exclusive licenses. The Company therefore accounted for these deliverables, on a license-by-license basis, as a combined
	unit of accounting. The Company concluded that the option to secure licenses for three targets was not substantive, as the Company was not at risk with regard to GSK exercising its option due to the size of the upfront payment and the research
	funding commitment. Since the option was not considered substantive, the Company considered the licenses to be deliverables at the inception of the agreement. While the Company concluded that there were three units of accounting, each consisting of
	a license to a target and the research and development services related to that target, because the targets were at similar stages of development at the inception of the agreement, had equal probabilities of success and the research services in each
	unit of accounting were initially expected to be performed concurrently on a ratable basis over the research term, the Company allocated the arrangement consideration equally across the three targets. Accordingly, the $30.0 million of allocable
	arrangement consideration, consisting of the $20.0 million upfront payment, $4.0 million in milestone payments achieved during the selection term and the $6.0 million fixed research funding, was recognized as collaboration revenue, on a
	target-by-target basis, ratably from the conclusion of the selection term, in July 2012, through the end of the research term, or earlier if a target reaches development candidate selection, at which point GSK is solely responsible for development
	and commercialization. In December 2013, the Company and GSK agreed to the selection of a development candidate for one of the three targets under the agreement, earning the Company a $4.0 million milestone payment and reducing the period over which
	the Company is recognizing revenue for this target by nine months. Accordingly, the Company recognized the remaining deferred revenue related to this target during the first quarter of 2014. As to this target, GSK is solely responsible for
	subsequent development and commercialization.

	The $3.0 million upfront payment received in connection with the March 2014 amendment was allocated equally
	to the remaining two targets for which the Company was actively providing research and development services, as these remaining two targets were at similar stages of development, had equal probabilities of success and the remaining research services
	were expected to be performed concurrently on a ratable basis over the research term. The $3.0 million was recognized as collaboration revenue, on a target-by-target basis, ratably from the execution of the amendment, in March 2014, through the end
	of the research term. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company agreed to perform additional preclinical research and development studies related to the third target under the agreement, which extended the research term for this target through June
	2015. Accordingly, the Company recognized the remaining deferred revenue related to this deliverable, of approximately $1.2 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, in 2015.

	During the selection term, the Company received $4.0 million upon the achievement of preclinical research and development milestones which required effort in
	the form of research activities by the Company and was not certain to be achieved at the execution of the agreement. However, because GSK had the right to drop a target and select a replacement target at any point during the selection term, the
	Company, in such a case, would have been obligated to perform the validation work for a replacement target. Consequently, this $4.0 million in preclinical research and development milestones was combined with the upfront payment and fixed research
	funding and was recognized as collaboration revenue ratably over the research term. The Company has evaluated the remaining milestones under this agreement and determined that the milestones through development candidate selection are substantive
	given the significant uncertainty as to the outcome of the substantial research efforts to be performed by the Company in order to achieve the milestones and will be recognized as revenue upon achievement, assuming all other revenue recognition
	criteria are met. The milestones after development candidate selection are not considered substantive because the Company does not contribute effort to the achievement of such milestones, which would generally be achieved after the research term. In

	In addition to creating rights for

	Plan participants and beneficiaries. Employers nor any other person may fire an employee or otherwise discriminate against an employee in any way to prevent an employee from obtaining a benefit under the Plan or exercising the employee&#146;s rights

	the denial. The employee has the right to have the Plan Administrator review and reconsider the employee&#146;s claim. Under ERISA, there are steps an employee can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if the employee requests materials
	from the Plan Administrator and does not receive them within 30 days, the employee may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay the employee up to $110 per day until
	the employee receives the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.

	If an

	or her rights, the employee may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.
