	Our most advanced product candidate is AGS-003, which we are developing for the treatment
	of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or mRCC, and other cancers. We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of
	AGS-003 plus sunitinib or another targeted therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed mRCC under a special protocol assessment,
	or SPA, with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We refer to this trial as the ADAPT trial. We initiated the ADAPT trial
	in January 2013, dosed the first patient in May 2013 and completed enrollment of the trial in July 2015. Based upon the actual
	rate of enrollment and projected event rate as defined in the protocol, we anticipate having a sufficient number of events to permit
	the primary analysis and assessment of overall survival to occur in the first half of 2017. The independent data monitoring committee
	for the ADAPT trial has twice recommended the continuation of the ADAPT trial based on results of its data analyses for safety
	and futility. We expect the independent data monitoring committee to meet again in June 2016 and approximately six months later
	in 2016 to conduct additional data analyses. We are also supporting investigator-initiated Phase 2 trials in patients with early
	stage RCC and non-small cell lung cancer and plan to support investigator-initiated trials of AGS-003 in mRCC and bladder cancer.

	Our proprietary Arcelis technology platform utilizes biological components from a patient&#8217;s
	own cancer cells or virus to generate truly individualized immunotherapies. These immunotherapies employ specialized white blood
	cells called dendritic cells to activate an immune response specific to the patient&#8217;s own disease. Arcelis is based on the
	work of Dr.&nbsp;Ralph Steinman, winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in medicine for the discovery of the role of dendritic cells in
	the immune system. We believe our Arcelis-based immunotherapies are applicable to a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases
	and have the following attributes that we consider critical to a successful immunotherapy:

	We are developing AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC and other cancers. We are currently conducting
	the ADAPT trial of AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed mRCC under an SPA with the FDA.
	We initiated the ADAPT trial in January 2013 and dosed the first patient in May 2013. In July 2015 we completed enrollment in the
	trial, enrolling 462 patients with the goal of generating 290 events for the primary endpoint of overall survival. We enrolled
	these patients at 127 clinical sites in North America, Europe and Israel. Under the trial protocol, these patients were randomized
	between the AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy combination arm and the sunitinib / targeted therapy alone control arm on
	a two-to-one basis. Based upon the actual rate of enrollment and projected event rate as defined in the protocol, we anticipate

	We believe that AGS-003 may be capable of treating a wide range of cancers and
	are planning to evaluate AGS-003 in clinical trials in additional cancer indications. We are supporting an
	investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-003 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, that was
	initiated in the first quarter of 2016. In the trial, the safety, efficacy and immunologic effects of AGS-003 when combined
	with platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation will be evaluated in approximately 20 stage 3 NSCLC patients. In the trial,
	AGS-003 will be administered either concurrently with chemotherapy and with or without radiation or sequentially with
	chemotherapy and with or without radiation, according to the patient&#8217;s assigned treatment arm. The rationale for this
	trial is two-fold. First, NSCLC is a tumor type reported to have a high number of mutated targets for the immune system,
	which could make it more susceptible to AGS-003&#8217;s mechanism of action. Secondly, platinum-based chemotherapy has
	immunomodulatory effects by downregulating immunosuppressive regulatory T cells which may lead to an additive or synergistic
	effect with AGS-003. We also plan to support an additional investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-003 in muscle
	invasive bladder cancer, which we expect may begin in mid-2016. The trial has two phases: a pre-treatment phase and a
	treatment phase. In the pre-treatment phase, tumor tissue will be obtained via a transurethral resection of the bladder
	tumor, which will then be used to extract RNA for the manufacture of AGS-003. In the treatment phase, AGS-003 will be given
	before tumor resection and combined with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy. Booster doses of AGS-003 will continue
	after tumor resection. As with the neoadjuvant renal cancer trial, we have the unique opportunity to observe any meaningful
	impact of AGS-003 on the immune response in the peripheral blood and immune responses infiltrating the primary tumor.

	We are developing AGS-004 for the treatment of HIV and are focusing this program on the
	use of AGS-004 in combination with other therapies for the eradication of HIV. We believe that by combining AGS-004 with therapies
	that are being developed to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system, we can potentially eradicate the
	virus. The current standard of care, antiretroviral drug therapy, or ART, can reduce levels of HIV in a patient&#8217;s blood,
	increase the patient&#8217;s life expectancy and improve the patient&#8217;s quality of life. However, ART cannot eliminate the
	virus, which persists in latently infected cells, remains undetectable by the immune system and can recur. In addition, ART requires
	daily, life-long treatment and can have significant side effects.

	We are supporting an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 in up to
	12 adult HIV patients to evaluate the use of AGS-004 in combination with one of these latency reversing therapies for the
	eradication of HIV at the University of North Carolina. This trial is being conducted in two stages. Stage 1 of this trial
	has been completed and was designed to study immune response kinetics to AGS-004 in patients on continuous ART. These data
	were used to better define the optimal dosing strategy in combination with a latency reversing therapy in the ongoing Stage
	2. We expect that some patients in Stage 1 will rollover into Stage 2, which is studying AGS-004 in combination with one of
	the latency reversing drugs. The patient clinical costs for the first stage of this trial were funded by Collaboratory of
	AIDS Researchers for Eradication, or CARE. The NIH Division of AIDS has approved $6.6 million in funding for the second stage

	support an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 monotherapy in pediatric patients infected with HIV who
	have otherwise healthy immune systems and have been treated with ART since birth or shortly thereafter and, as a result, are
	lacking the antiviral memory T-cells to combat the virus. The commencement of this trial is subject to supportive data
	obtained from the adult eradication trial and approval of the protocol by the principal investigator(s), institutional review
	boards, the IMPAACT Network leadership and the FDA and to the agreement by the NIH to fund the trial costs not related to

	Cancer cells utilize several strategies to escape detection by the immune system and
	T-cells. For example, cancer cells secrete factors that act systemically to prevent T-cells from responding to activation signals,
	resulting in the inability of T-cells to carry out their role of killing cancer cells. Chronic viral infections such as HIV or
	hepatitis C present the same challenges to the immune system as cancer because the immune system must overcome this disease-induced
	immune suppression to recognize and respond to virus-infected cells.

	Cancer immunotherapies that use an antigen-based approach are designed to stimulate
	an immune response against one or more tumor-associated antigens. In most cases, the tumor-associated antigens that are being
	targeted are non-mutated, or normal, antigens, which are usually well tolerated by the immune system. In the context of cancer,
	these normal antigens are either produced at abnormally high levels or predominantly in tumor cells, or both. The goal of antigen-based
	immunotherapies is to activate the patient&#8217;s own immune system to seek out and kill the cancer cells that carry the targeted
	antigen. Dendreon Corporation&#8217;s Provenge (sipuleucel-T) for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is the only antigen-based
	immunotherapy that has been approved by the FDA. Because these immunotherapies are designed to target specific antigens, they
	are less likely to have toxicity. However, antigen-based immunotherapies may have limited efficacy because they are only able
	to capture one or a limited number of antigens, which may or may not be present in the patient&#8217;s cancer cells, and do not
	capture mutated antigens.

	Immunotherapies that rely on the pathway approach are designed to overcome immunosuppression
	in patients by blocking signaling pathways that prevent T-cell activation and function. The class of monoclonal antibody-based
	immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors are being developed on the basis of this approach. For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb&#8217;s
	immunotherapy Yervoy (ipilimumab), an FDA-approved treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, is designed
	to act by blocking the function of a protein expressed in activated T-cells called CTLA4, which acts as a T-cell &#8220;off&#8221;
	switch. By blocking the function of CTLA4, the patient&#8217;s T-cells can become activated, resulting in an immune response against
	tumors. Another pathway that immunotherapies are being developed to address is the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. In this pathway, activated
	T-cells expressing the protein PD-1 are disabled when binding occurs between PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, which is expressed on
	tumor cells. Immunotherapies are being developed to interrupt this pathway by binding to the PD-1 protein or the PD-L1 ligand to
	prevent them from binding with each other. Two of these anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors were recently approved by FDA: Merck&#8217;s
	Keytruda for NSCLC and advanced melanoma and Bristol-Myers Squibb&#8217;s Opdivo for NSCLC, advanced melanoma and mRCC. Immunotherapies
	that use a pathway approach have demonstrated the ability to effectively overcome immunosuppression and enable T-cells to function
	against tumor cells and potentially virus-infected cells. . However, pathway-based immunotherapies are limited because they act
	systemically to enable T-cells to function and do not specifically target a patient&#8217;s tumor or the associated antigens. This
	lack of specificity can negatively impact healthy tissue and generate unwanted toxicity.

	RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer. The American Cancer Society, or ACS
	estimates that there will be approximately 63,000 new cases of kidney cancer and approximately 14,000 deaths from this disease
	in the United States in 2016. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN estimates that 90% of kidney cancer cases are
	RCC. For patients with RCC that had metastasized by the time RCC was first diagnosed, a condition referred to as newly diagnosed
	mRCC, the five-year survival rate has historically been approximately 12%.
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 12PT 0 0">
	ACS statistics indicate that approximately 25% of newly diagnosed RCC patients present
	with mRCC annually in the United States. Additional patients who were initially diagnosed with earlier stage RCC may also progress
	to mRCC as these patients suffer relapses. The NCCN estimates between 20% to 30% of patients with early stage RCC will relapse
	within three years of surgical excision of the primary tumor. Although the National Cancer Institute, or NCI does not provide prevalence
	of RCC by stage, based on the NCCN&#8217;s three-year relapse rate, we estimate that there may be up to an additional 10,000 to
	15,000 cases of mRCC identified annually in the United States. Combining newly diagnosed mRCC patients with patients who relapse,
	we estimate that there may be between 20,000 to 25,000 new cases of mRCC in the United States each year. We estimate, based on
	publicly available information, including 2013 quarterly and annual reports of companies that market targeted therapies approved
	for mRCC, that the current worldwide mRCC market for these targeted therapies exceeds $2 billion.
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 12PT 0 0">
	Physicians generally diagnose mRCC by examining a tumor biopsy under a microscope.
	Upon evaluation of the visual appearance of the tumor cells, a pathologist will classify the mRCC into clear cell or non-clear
	cell types. According to the NCCN, approximately 80% of all RCC diagnoses are clear cell RCC. Because clear cell types are the
	most common type of tumor cell, most of the more recently approved therapies for mRCC have limited their clinical trials to patients
	with the clear cell type of tumor cell. However, the FDA has not limited the approval of these therapies to clear cell types of
	mRCC, so they may be used for both clear cell and non-clear cell types.

	The initial treatment for most mRCC patients when the primary tumor is intact is surgical
	removal of the tumor, usually requiring partial or complete removal of the affected kidney, referred to as nephrectomy. The NCCN
	generally recommends systemic treatment with approved therapies for mRCC patients following nephrectomy for patients whose tumors
	have metastasized or for patients who present with mRCC upon diagnosis or as a result of a relapse from an earlier stage of RCC.

	Historically, mRCC has been treated with non-specific, cytokine-based immunotherapies
	such as interferon
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: SYMBOL">

	and IL-2, which have demonstrated a clinical benefit in a small number
	of mRCC patients. However, these therapies lack specificity and have been demonstrated to have severe toxicities, which can lead
	to cardiopulmonary, neuropsychiatric, dermatologic, renal, hepatic and hematologic side effects and limits their use. For example,
	although high-dose IL-2 is the only therapy to have demonstrated durable complete mRCC remissions, its toxicity restricts its use

	Phase 3 clinical trial than that shown by the other targeted therapies in their pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. According to an
	independent market research survey conducted during the second half of 2014 of 87 US-based medical oncologists and new prescription
	data (IMS), Sutent is still the first-line drug of choice for approximately half of newly treated advanced RCC patients. In addition,

	Although most of these targeted therapies have demonstrated prolonged progression

<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: SYMBOL">
	a
</FONT>
	, they are rarely associated with durable remissions
	or enhanced long-term survival, particularly in patients who are classified as intermediate or poor risk at the time of treatment.
	In addition, each of these targeted therapies has shortcomings that limit their use in the treatment of mRCC, including significant
	toxicities, such as neutropenia and other hematologic toxicities, fatigue, diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension and other
	cardiovascular effects. The overlapping and combined toxicities of the targeted therapies have prevented their use in combination
	therapies. For instance, researchers conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of the combination of sunitinib and temsirolimus discontinued
	the trial due to toxicities. We believe that the inability to date to combine these therapies without additive toxicity and the
	absence of durable remissions and prolonged survival in patients with intermediate and poor risk disease indicates there is an
	unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches for mRCC that can improve efficacy without adding any appreciable toxicity.

	Our design for this trial requires adult patients who have been newly diagnosed with
	mRCC with primary tumor intact and metastatic disease following nephrectomy, who have predominantly clear cell RCC based upon the
	tumor collected at nephrectomy and who have not received any prior therapies for RCC. Participating patients must be suitable candidates
	for sunitinib therapy and possess poor risk or intermediate risk disease at presentation, with the less than one year to treatment
	risk factor and not more than four Heng risk factors in total. As part of the trial design, the two arms of the trial are balanced
	based upon known prognostic risk factors. Patients are stratified by number of risk factors (1, 2, 3 or 4) as well as whether they
	had measurable versus non-measurable metastatic disease following nephrectomy. The patient population in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical
	trial is generally comparable to the patient population treated in our Phase 2 combination therapy clinical trial. Approximately
	73% of the patients enrolled in the trial are intermediate risk patients (1-2 risk factors) and 27% are poor risk (3-4 risk factors).

	Under the trial protocol, patients in the AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy
	arm are dosed with AGS-003 once every three weeks for five doses, followed by a booster dose every three months. In accordance
	with its label, sunitinib dosing is administered in six-week cycles, consisting of four weeks on drug and two weeks on drug holiday.
	AGS-003 dosing is initiated at the end of the initial six-week sunitinib cycle. The first dose of AGS-003 is administered prior
	to the start of sunitinib dosing in the second sunitinib cycle. This dosing regimen is identical to the dosing regimen used in
	our Phase 2 combination therapy clinical trial of AGS-003 and sunitinib, except that the start of the sixth dose is scheduled for
	week 24 to better provide patients the opportunity to receive a total of eight doses across 48 weeks. Patients in the sunitinib
	monotherapy control arm receive sunitinib on the same dosing schedule as patients receive sunitinib in the AGS-003-sunitinib combination
	arm.

	Under the trial protocol, AGS-003 is administered for at least 48 weeks so that patients
	receive at least eight doses of AGS-003. Dosing will cease prior to 48 weeks if two events of disease progression or unacceptable
	toxicity occur or upon the joint decision of the patient and the investigator. If after 48 weeks of dosing of AGS-003, a patient
	has stable disease or is responding to treatment, dosing will continue once every three months until disease progression. If an
	investigator determines to discontinue sunitinib, either due to disease progression or toxicity, the investigator can, at any time
	during the trial after the first six week cycle of sunitinib, initiate second-line therapy with one of the other approved targeted
	therapies, including pazopanib, axitinib, everolimus or temsirolimus. In the event of discontinuation of sunitinib for patients
	in the combination therapy arm, such patients would continue with AGS-003 dosing in combination with the second-line therapy. In
	our Phase 2 combination therapy clinical trial, dosing ceased upon the first event of disease progression and second-line therapy

	Phase 2 Combination Therapy Clinical Trial
</I>
	.&nbsp;From July 2008 to October 2009, we
	enrolled 21 newly diagnosed mRCC patients in a single arm, multicenter, open label Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-003 in combination
	with sunitinib. We conducted this clinical trial at nine clinical sites in the United States and Canada. Our design for the trial
	required adult patients with previously untreated mRCC, no prior nephrectomy or at least one accessible lesion for biopsy, a histologically
	confirmed predominantly clear cell tumor, and suitability for sunitinib therapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was complete
	response rate. Secondary endpoints included progression free survival, overall survival, safety, clinical benefit rate and immune
	response.

	Patients in the trial generally received one initial six-week cycle of sunitinib, consisting
	of four weeks on drug and two weeks on drug holiday, prior to initiating the combined treatment with AGS-003. Patients then received
	a dose of AGS-003 every three weeks for a total of five doses, while also continuing three additional six-week cycles of sunitinib.
	This 24-week induction phase was followed by a booster phase during which patients received a dose of AGS-003 once every three
	months and continued to receive sunitinib in six-week cycles until disease progression.

	Of the nine patients who exhibited a partial response, four patients exhibited partial responses during the 24-week induction phase, including two patients who exhibited partial responses prior to initiation of treatment with AGS-003. The other three patients exhibited partial responses after prolonged dosing with AGS-003 during the booster phase. We do not believe that these late occurring partial responses have been observed in clinical trials of sunitinib alone. As a result, we believe that these late responses may relate to the immunologic effects of prolonged AGS-003 dosing and AGS-003&#8217;s effect on CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cells.

	In the 14 patients in the trial who received at least five doses of AGS-003 and could be evaluated for memory T-cell response, we observed a statistically significant correlation between the increase in the number of CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cells over the initial five doses of AGS-003 and survival (p&lt;0.002), progression free survival (p&lt;0.031) and reduced metastatic tumor burden (p&lt;0.045).

	The original design for the Phase 2 clinical trial called for the recruitment of 50 patients
	to generate 38 fully evaluable patients. However, in October 2009, we terminated enrollment in this trial early due to a lack of
	funding. As a result, only 21 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of AGS-003. In addition, the trial was originally
	designed to enroll patients with favorable and intermediate risk disease profiles. Instead, the actual population enrolled consisted
	entirely of patients with intermediate or poor risk disease profiles who had the less than one year to treatment risk factor. Because
	the patient population had poorer prognoses when they entered the trial than we expected and we did not have a sufficient number
	of evaluable patients, we did not perform the statistical analysis to determine whether the primary endpoint of complete response
	rate was achieved. As a result, we expect the data from this trial to be considered by the FDA for the purpose of evaluating the
	safety and feasibility of AGS-003, but that it will only have a limited impact on the FDA&#8217;s ultimate assessment of the efficacy

	HIV is characterized by a chronic viral infection and an associated deterioration of
	immune function. Specifically, the virus disables and kills crucial human immune cells called CD4+ T-cells. CD4+ T-cells are necessary
	to generate and maintain antiviral T-cells, including the CD8+CD28+ memory T cells that kill virus-infected cells. Over time, this
	viral impact on an infected person&#8217;s immune system outpaces the body&#8217;s natural ability to replace CD4+ T-cells and

	ART cannot eradicate the virus and, therefore, does not cure HIV-infected patients. For example, up to 20% of patients receiving

	Potential to Eradicate HIV in Combination with Latency Reversing Drugs
</I>
	.&nbsp;A number of companies and academic groups
	are evaluating drugs that can potentially activate the latently infected cells to increase viral antigen expression and make the
	cells vulnerable to elimination by the immune system. We believe that treating HIV-infected patients, who are being successfully
	treated with ART, with a combination of AGS-004 and one of these latency reversing drugs could lead to activation of antigen expression
	from the latently infected cells along with a potent memory T-cell response that is specific to the patient&#8217;s own unique
	viral antigens. We believe that this approach could potentially result in complete eradication of the patient&#8217;s virus.

	Long-Term Viral Load Control in Immunologically Healthy Patients
</I>
	.&nbsp;We believe that AGS-004 may allow for long-term
	virus control and eliminate the need for life-long treatment with ART in infected patients who have minimal immune suppression
	but no T-cell response against their virus. We have designed AGS-004 to induce CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cells that are specific to the
	patient&#8217;s own unique viral antigens, do not require CD4+ T-cell help to kill viral cells and do not result in CD4+ T-cell
	activation which typically increases viral replication and viral load. As reported in
<I>
	Clinical&nbsp;&amp; Experimental Immunology
</I>
	,
	researchers have demonstrated that elevated levels of CD8+CD28+ memory T-cells in the blood are a statistically significant predictor
	of long-term non-progression in HIV-infected patients not treated with ART drugs. As a result, we believe that inducing these memory
	T-cells may lead to viral control. Patients with minimal immune suppression and no T-cell response include pediatric patients who
	have been successfully treated with ART drugs since birth or shortly thereafter and have generally healthy immune systems.

	AGS-004 is a truly individualized immunotherapy based on our Arcelis platform. It is
	produced by electroporating dendritic cells with mRNA encoding for patient-specific HIV antigens that have been derived from a
	patient&#8217;s virus-infected blood and with RNA that encodes the CD40L protein. The process for producing AGS-004 is the same
	process as is used to produce AGS-003, with the one key difference being that AGS-003 contains all of the antigens from a patient&#8217;s
	tumor cells while AGS-004 contains potentially all variants unique to each individual patient of four selected HIV antigens (Gag,
	Nef, Vpr and Rev). We designed AGS-004 to include these antigens because immunity to them has been observed in long-term non-progressors
	and elite controllers, two groups of rare patients able to control virus replication without ART. Because no two patients share
	identical HIV antigen sequences and there are a large number of mutated variants of HIV existing in each infected patient, by using
	mRNA that is specific to the patient&#8217;s virus and that captures potentially all of the unique patient-specific variants of
	each antigen, we believe our immunotherapy maximizes the relevance of the immune responses induced in each patient.

	We are focusing our development program for AGS-004 on the use of AGS-004 in combination
	with latency reversing therapies to achieve complete virus eradication. Latently infected cells differ from other infected cells
	in that the HIV genome is permanently integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the latently infected cells. These latently infected
	cells persist long-term and constitute the HIV latent reservoir, which serves as a source for low level virus replication and viral
	rebound in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. As a result, demonstration that latently infected cells can be targeted by immune
	responses induced by AGS-004 is essential to our development strategy pertaining to virus eradication.

	Adult Eradication Trial.

	&nbsp;We are supporting an investigator-initiated Phase 2
	clinical trial of AGS-004 in adult HIV patients who are being treated with ART to evaluate the use of AGS-004 to eradicate the
	virus. The trial is being conducted by co-investigator Dr.&nbsp;David Margolis, Professor of Medicine at the University of North
	Carolina. Dr.&nbsp;Margolis is the leader of the Collaboratory of AIDS Researchers for Eradication, or CARE, and has been a pioneer
	in the research of HIV latent reservoir reversing treatments. The trial is being conducted in two stages. In the first stage, HIV-infected
	patients received AGS-004 while remaining on ART and the kinetics of the anti-HIV CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cell responses were evaluated.
	In the second stage, which Dr. Margolis initiated in the first quarter of 2016, the use of AGS-004 in combination with the latency
	reversing drug Vorinostat will be evaluated. CARE funded all patient clinical costs for the first stage of this Phase 2 clinical
	trial, except for the associated manufacturing costs for which we were responsible. The NIH Division of AIDS has approved $6.6
	million in funding for the second stage of this trial.

	Planned Pediatric Functional Cure Trial
</I>
	.&nbsp;We believe that a patient population
	that could benefit from AGS-004 monotherapy consists of 14+ year old, HIV-infected individuals who have been treated with ART since
	birth or shortly thereafter. These individuals are characterized by having very small HIV latent reservoirs and otherwise healthy
	immune systems, while lacking antiviral CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cell responses. We believe that successfully inducing antiviral CD8+
	CD28+ memory T-cell responses in these patients could allow for long-term viral load control and eliminate the need for life-long
	antiretroviral therapy. We plan to support an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 in pediatric HIV patients
	to evaluate the use of AGS-004 monotherapy to allow for long-term control of viral load and eliminate the need for ART. We are
	currently developing the clinical protocol for this trial to immunize pediatric HIV patients who were infected at birth and treated
	with antiretroviral therapy at or near birth. We are developing this clinical protocol in collaboration with Drs. Katherine Luzuriaga,
	University of Massachusetts, and Deborah Persaud, John Hopkins Medical Center, both specializing in pediatric virology. The commencement
	of this trial is subject to supportive data obtained from the adult eradication trial and approval of the protocol by the principal
	investigator(s), institutional review boards, the IMPAACT Network leadership and the FDA and to the agreement by the NIH to fund
	the trial costs not related to AGS-004 manufacturing. Assuming the supportive data and the necessary approvals are obtained, we
	expect this trial to initiate in 2017.

	Phase 2b Clinical Trial
</I>
	.&nbsp;In January 2015, we completed a randomized, placebo
	controlled, double blind Phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004 in chronically infected patients on ART that we initiated in July 2010.
	We designed this trial to confirm the data obtained in an earlier Phase 2a clinical trial in which AGS-004 led to a reduction in
	virus replication. We initially planned to enroll 42 chronically infected patients in the Phase 2b trial at nine clinical sites
	in the United States and Canada with the intent to generate 36 events for the primary endpoint analysis. However, due to a higher
	than anticipated dropout rate by patients who were unable to complete the full 12 week treatment interruption period provided for
	by the trial, we needed to enroll 53 patients in the trial to generate 36 events for the primary endpoint analysis. These patients
	were randomized between AGS-004 treatment and a placebo control on a two-to-one basis.

	HIV infection is classified as &#8220;chronic&#8221; or &#8220;acute&#8221; based on

	ART after at least six months from the time of initial infection. Patients with acute HIV infection are patients who have initiated

	In September 2011, we added to the trial a single arm, open-label, unblinded cohort
	of up to 12 patients with acute HIV-1 infection and undetectable viral loads as a result of treatment with ART. We evaluated AGS-004

	may have sustained less immune damage. Patients in this cohort were dosed in the same manner as patients in the chronically infected
	arm of the clinical trial. However, in this cohort, patients had to demonstrate a positive CD8+ CD28+ anti-HIV memory T-cell response
	in order to become eligible to enter the 12 week treatment interruption period. The primary endpoints for this cohort included
	the time to detectable viral load during the ART interruption period and comparison of changes in CD4+ T-cell counts during the
	ART interruption period between the acute cohort and the chronic cohort. Six patients were enrolled in this cohort. All six patients
	demonstrated a positive CD8+ CD28+ memory T-cell response and initiated treatment interruption. For the five of six patients that
	re-initiated ART after treatment interruption, there were no significant declines in CD4+ T cells between the interruption date
	and the re-initiation date. All six patients experienced viral rebound during treatment interruption with the times to detectable
	viral load ranging from two to eight weeks and the duration of treatment interruption for those patients who reinitiated ART ranged
	from approximately one month to approximately nine months. In addition, three of six patients had a decrease in circulating CD4+
	T cells containing HIV DNA of 25%, 47% and 63%, respectively, when measured after three doses of AGS-004 while on ART.

	to induce memory T-cell responses which may have directly impacted the latent viral reservoir. Of the evaluated 22 patients who

	In August 2014, in connection with our plan to build out and equip a commercial manufacturing
	facility, we entered into a lease agreement with the developer, TKC LXXII, LLC, or TKC. Under the lease agreement, we agreed to
	lease certain land and an approximately 124,000 square-foot building to be constructed in Durham County, North Carolina. This facility
	would house our corporate headquarters and commercial manufacturing. The shell of the new facility was constructed on a build-to-suit
	basis in accordance with agreed upon specifications and plans and was completed in June 2015. A portion of the build-out and equipping
	of the interior of the facility began in the second half of 2015.

	Under the lease agreement, we had an option to purchase the property. In February

	Due to our limited resources and the costs and challenges of building and equipping a new

	current facility for commercial manufacture, leasing and equipping an existing manufacturing space that would be built out for
	commercial manufacture, and engaging a contract manufacturer to supply AGS-003 on a commercial scale on our behalf. We believe

	facility is constructed and operated in accordance with current good manufacturing practice. We would also be required to show
	the comparability between AGS-003 that we produce using the manual processes in our current facility and AGS-003 produced using

	of our Arcelis-based product candidates.

<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 12PT 0 0">
	We plan to use the automated equipment to perform Arcelis product processing in closed,
	single-use disposable containers. A patient&#8217;s disease sample would only be in contact with these single use disposable containers
	and not with any component of our manufacturing equipment. Because our equipment would never be in direct contact with patient
	material, we believe that the time required to prepare the equipment between batches would be minimal. We also believe that automated

	required labor.

<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: SYMBOL">

	and IL-2. More recently, the

	RCC, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. In addition, we estimate that there are numerous therapies for mRCC in clinical development
	by many public and private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting numerous different cancer types and stages. A number
	of these are in late stage development. Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) in combination for first-line mRCC is being
	developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is currently being compared in a Phase 3 trial to sunitinib. Cometriq (cabozantinib) is being
	developed by Exelixis has recently reported positive results from its Phase 3 trial and is expected to receive FDA approval for
	second-line mRCC in 2016. In addition, if a standalone therapy for mRCC were developed that demonstrated improved efficacy over
	currently marketed first-line therapies with a favorable safety profile and without the need for combination therapy, such a therapy
	might pose a significant competitive threat to AGS-003.

	security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements
	or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may

	&nbsp;In December 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Medinet.

	development and sale for the treatment of mRCC in Japan. If Medinet exercises the sale option, it may only manufacture

	On October, 29, 2014, we entered into a development
	agreement with&nbsp;Invetech Pty Ltd, or Invetech. The development agreement supersedes and replaces the development
	agreement entered into by the parties as of July 20, 2005.&nbsp;Under the development agreement, Invetech agreed to continue
	to develop and provide prototypes of the automated production system to be used for the manufacture of our&nbsp;Arcelis-based
	products, or the Production Systems. Development services will be performed on a proposal by proposal basis. Invetech has
	agreed to defer 30% of its fees, but such deferral may not exceed $5,000,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred fees (plus interest of 7%
	per annum) would become payable either, at our option, in a lump sum within 90 days of the &#8220;Sunset Date Trigger
	Event&#8221; or pursuant to an installment plan (either in&nbsp;four installments payable within the first year or&nbsp;eight
	installments payable within the first two years after the &#8220;Sunset Date Trigger Event&#8221;).&nbsp; Under the current
	terms of the agreement, the &#8220;Sunset Date Trigger Event&#8221; is December 31, 2016 or is June 30, 2016 if prior to such
	date our ongoing Phase 3 ADAPT clinical trial is closed early following the interim review at 50% or 75% of events, due to a
	positive efficacy outcome in favor of the active treatment arm that contains AGS-003. Invetech is entitled to a 10% bonus
	payment if this clinical trial is closed early indicating positive efficacy and Invetech has timely completed all activities
	up to the time of such early closure. We are planning to renegotiate the terms of the development agreement related to the
	deferred fees and bonus payment.

	.&nbsp;Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care

	The PPACA, among other things, permits the FDA to approve biosimilar or interchangeable versions of biological products through
	an abbreviated approval pathway following periods of data and marketing exclusivity. Biological products that are considered to
	be &#8220;reference products&#8221; are granted two overlapping periods of data and marketing exclusivity: a four-year period during
	which no abbreviated biologics license application, or abbreviated BLA, relying upon the reference product may be submitted to
	the FDA, and a twelve-year period during which no abbreviated BLA relying upon the reference product may be approved by FDA. For
	purposes of the PPACA, a reference product is defined as the single biological product licensed under a full BLA against which
	a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under an abbreviated BLA.

	We believe that our investigational products, if approved via full BLAs, will be considered
	&#8220;reference products&#8221; that are entitled to both four-year and twelve-year exclusivity under the PPACA. The FDA, however,
	has not issued any regulations or final guidance explaining how it will implement the PPACA, including the exclusivity provisions
	for reference products. Since February 2012, the FDA has issued six draft guidance documents that provide its preliminary thoughts
	on how to interpret and implement the abbreviated BLA provisions of the PPACA. The FDA has requested public comments on these draft
	guidance documents, including the proper interpretation of PPACA exclusivity provisions. It is thus possible that the FDA will
	decide to interpret the PPACA in such a way that our products are not considered to be reference products for purposes of the PPACA
	or be entitled to any period of data or marketing exclusivity. Even if our products are considered to be reference products and
	obtain exclusivity under the PPACA, another company nevertheless could also market a competing version of any of our biological
	products if such company can complete, and the FDA permits the submission of and approves, a full BLA. Although protection under
	PPACA will not prevent the submission or approval of another &#8220;full&#8221; BLA, the applicant would be required to conduct
	its own preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency (i.e., effectiveness).

	Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
</I>
	.&nbsp;Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA
	may grant orphan drug designation to a drug (including a biologic) intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally
	a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the
	United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States
	a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation
	must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic
	agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 0PT 0">

<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
	If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval
	for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the
	FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication for
	seven years. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines &#8220;same drug&#8221; as a drug that contains the same active
	moiety and is intended for the same use as the previously approved orphan drug. For purposes of large molecule drugs, the FDA defines
	&#8220;same drug&#8221; as a drug that contains the same principal molecular structural features, but not necessarily all of the
	same structural features, and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. Notwithstanding the above definitions, a drug
	that is clinically superior to an orphan drug will not be considered the &#8220;same drug&#8221; and thus will not be blocked by
	orphan drug exclusivity.

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug

	as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor
	will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the

	of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Our product candidates
	may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does
	not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to

	The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign
	governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices
	charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services,
	in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared
	to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the
	level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at an appropriate return on investment. The U.S. government,
	state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the
	growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution
	of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies
	in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug product candidates
	that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.

	Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries
	provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion
	of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For
	example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national
	health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member
	states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability
	of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products,
	but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs,
	has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some
	countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There

	The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial
	sale may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis
	on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage
	policies, third party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the PPACA and a related
	reconciliation bill, which we collectively refer to as the Affordable Care Act or ACA, contain provisions that may reduce the profitability
	of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for covered outpatient drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of
	Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and annual fees
	based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal health care programs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement

	Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must
	conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing
	is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one
	or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials
	may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict
	final results. For instance, despite observing positive results in earlier clinical trials of AGS-004, we failed to achieve the
	primary endpoint of our Phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004. Similarly, recommendations of the independent data monitoring committee
	that the ADAPT trial should be continued based on results of the committee&#8217;s interim data analyses of interim trial results
	may not be indicative as to results of the trial. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations
	and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and
	clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.

	In particular, to date, we have not completed a clinical trial of AGS-003 against a placebo
	or a comparator therapy. While we believe comparisons to results from other reported clinical trials or from analyses of data from
	the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium, or the Consortium, can assist in evaluating the potential
	efficacy of our AGS-003 product candidate, there are many factors that affect the outcome for patients, some of which are not apparent
	in published reports. As a result, results from two different trials or between a trial and an analysis of a treatment database
	often cannot be reliably compared. Our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 is intended to compare directly the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib
	or another targeted therapy to treatment with sunitinib or another targeted therapy monotherapy. Based on the design of the trial,
	the data from the trial will need to demonstrate an increase of approximately six months in median overall survival for the AGS-003
	plus sunitinib / targeted therapy arm as compared to the sunitinib / targeted therapy monotherapy control arm in order to show
	statistical significance and achieve the primary endpoint of the trial. We will need to show this statistically significant benefit
	of the combined therapy as compared to treatment with the sunitinib / targeted therapy monotherapy as part of a submission for
	approval of AGS-003. However, demonstration of statistical significance and achievement of the primary endpoint of the trial do
	not assure approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States.

	which are better than the results that occurred in those other clinical trials or the results described in the Consortium database,
	we may not demonstrate a sufficient benefit from AGS-003 in combination with sunitinib to allow the FDA to approve AGS-003 for
	marketing. In addition, only 21 patients received the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib in our Phase 2 clinical trial. If the
	patients in our ADAPT trial who receive the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib / targeted therapy have results which are worse

	For drug and biological products, the FDA typically requires the successful completion of
	two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to support marketing approval because a conclusion based on two such trials will
	be more reliable than a conclusion based on a single trial. In the case of AGS-003, which is intended for a life-threatening disease,
	we intend to seek approval based upon the results of a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, our ADAPT trial. The FDA reviewed
	our plans to conduct our ADAPT trial under its special protocol assessment, or SPA, process. In February 2013, the FDA advised
	us in a letter that it had completed its review of our plans under the SPA process. The FDA also informed us that in order for
	a single trial to support approval of an indication, the trial must be well conducted, and the results of the trial must be internally
	consistent, clinically meaningful and statistically very persuasive. If the results for the primary endpoint are not robust, are
	subject to confounding factors, or are not adequately supported by other trial endpoints, the FDA may refuse to approve our biologics
	license application, or BLA based upon a single clinical trial. In addition, because only 21 patients received the combination
	of AGS-003 and sunitinib in our Phase 2 clinical trial, and as a result, we did not have enough evaluable patients to perform the
	statistical analysis to determine whether the primary endpoint of complete response rate was achieved in that trial, we expect
	that the data from our Phase 2 clinical trial will have only a limited impact on the FDA&#8217;s ultimate assessment of efficacy
	of AGS-003. Thus, there can be no guarantee that the FDA will not require additional pivotal clinical trials as a condition for
	approving AGS-003.

	In addition, the patients recruited for clinical trials of our product candidates may

	disease risk profiles and with a primary endpoint of complete response rate. However, the actual trial population consisted entirely
	of patients with intermediate disease risk profiles and poor disease risk profiles. This is a population for which published research
	has shown that sunitinib alone, as well as other of the targeted therapies for mRCC, rarely if ever produce complete responses
	in mRCC, and in our Phase 2 clinical trial in this population the combination therapy of AGS-003 and sunitinib did not show a complete

	Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or
	obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or
	will be completed on schedule, or at all. For example, in response to our submission of an investigational new drug application,
	or IND, for AGS-004, the FDA raised safety concerns regarding the analytical treatment interruption contemplated by our protocol
	for our Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004, and required a one year safety follow-up after the final dose for each patient. This
	resulted in the need for an amendment to the trial protocol and a four month delay prior to initiating the Phase 2 clinical trial
	in the United States. In addition to additional costs, significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during
	which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market
	before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.

	The FDA has reviewed, under the SPA process, the protocol for our ADAPT trial of AGS-003
	in combination with sunitinib / targeted therapy. The SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA&#8217;s review and approval
	of drug and biological products by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of Phase 3 clinical trials that are
	intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug candidate&#8217;s efficacy. In February 2012, we received a letter from
	the FDA advising us that the FDA had completed its review of our protocol for the ADAPT trial under the SPA process. In the letter,

	seek the guidance of an outside advisory committee prior to making its final decision. In addition, the combination of AGS-003

	confounding factors, or are not adequately supported by other trial endpoints, the FDA may refuse to approve our BLA based upon

	existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2015 and the anticipated funding under our contract
	with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, will enable
	us to fund our operating expenses into the third quarter of 2016.

	Our March 2016 private placement includes three tranches. The initial tranche closed in March
	2016, and the second and third tranches are conditioned on the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and other closing conditions.
	For a description of the terms of the private placement, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Liquidity
	and Capital Resources&#8212;Sources of Liquidity&#8212;PIPE Financing&#8221;. If the milestones and closing conditions are achieved
	and the second and third tranches are consummated, we expect that the estimated $59.0 million of net proceeds from all three tranches
	of our private placement, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2015
	and the anticipated funding under our contract with the NIH and NIAID, will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the second
	quarter of 2017, when we expect final data from the ADAPT trial. We expect that these funds will be sufficient to enable us to
	support the ongoing and planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003, certain of the manufacturing costs of the ongoing
	Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 for HIV eradication in patients with early stage RCC and certain costs related to commercial
	manufacturing. We expect that these funds will not, however, be sufficient to enable us to complete required activities in preparation
	for the submission of a BLA to the FDA for AGS-003, to perform pre-commercialization activities for AGS-003 or to commercially
	launch AGS-003. These expectations are based on our current operating plan under which we plan to implement measures to reduce
	our operating expenses, including reductions in spending for activities in preparation for submission of a BLA. These reductions
	may include reductions in planned spending related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls, process validation, quality, supply
	management and commercial preparation. Under our plan, we also intend to seek to refinance our existing venture loan facility with
	Horizon Technology Finance Corporation, or Horizon, and Fortress Credit Co LLC, or Fortress, and to enter into collaborations for
	the development, marketing and distribution of AGS-003 outside North America and of our non-oncology product candidates, including
	AGS-004. If we are unable to refinance our venture loan facility or enter into any such collaborations, we may be required to implement
	additional measures to materially reduce our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business and operations. It is
	also possible that our available funds will not enable us to obtain final data from the ADAPT trial because the actual costs and
	timing of clinical trials are difficult to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays. We have no external sources
	of funds other than our contract with the NIH and NIAID for the development of AGS-004.

	We also will need to obtain significant financing if we decide to purchase, build out
	and equip a new commercial manufacturing facility. Our preliminary estimate indicates that we will require approximately an
	additional $30.0 million prior to the commercialization of AGS-003 to purchase, build out and equip the commercial
	manufacturing facility. These costs do not include the costs to implement the automated manufacturing process. We are
	actively exploring financing arrangements in connection with the planned purchase, build out and equipping of the commercial
	manufacturing facility and are in discussions with developers, lenders and other potential financing sources regarding
	potential financial support. Unless we select an alternative plan for the commercial supply of our products, we expect to
	enter into such arrangements during the second quarter of 2016 and that such arrangements will likely involve material
	obligations and debt liabilities. We are also exploring alternatives for the commercial supply of our products, including
	building out and equipping our current facility for commercial manufacture, leasing and equipping an existing manufacturing
	space that would be built out for commercial manufacture, and engaging a contract manufacturer to supply AGS-003 on a
	commercial scale on our behalf. We will also need to obtain additional financing with any of these alternatives. If we
	are unable to obtain additional financing when needed, in the required amounts or at all, we may not be able to complete

	The utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
	may be subject to limitation under the rules regarding a change in stock ownership as determined by the Internal Revenue Code,
	and state and foreign tax laws. Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes annual limitations on
	the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, other tax carryforwards, and certain built-in losses upon an ownership change
	as defined under that section. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions that increase the aggregate ownership
	of certain of our stockholders by more than 50 percentage points over a three year testing period. If we have undergone a Section&nbsp;382
	ownership change, an annual limitation would be imposed on certain of our tax attributes, including NOL and capital loss carryforwards,
	and certain other losses, credits, deductions or tax basis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have not completed a formal study
	to determine whether there are 382 limitations that apply However, we believe that, by engaging in the financing transactions in
	which we have engaged, we may have triggered an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; limitation. We may also experience
	ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income,
	our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax credit carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable
	income may be subject to limitations, which potentially could result in increased future tax liability to us.

	The FDA has approved several targeted therapies as monotherapies for mRCC, including
	Nexavar (sorafenib), marketed by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Sutent (sunitinib) and
	Inlyta (axitinib), marketed by Pfizer, Inc.; Avastin (bevacizumab), marketed by Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group; Votrient
	(pazopanib) and Afinitor (everolimus), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Torisel (temsirolimus), marketed by Pfizer
	and most recently, Opdivo (nivolumab) for second-line RCC, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. In addition, we estimate that there
	are numerous therapies for mRCC in clinical development by many public and private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting
	numerous different cancer types and stages. A number of these are in late stage development. Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab)
	in combination for first-line mRCC is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is currently being compared in a Phase 3 trial
	to sunitinib. Cometriq (cabozantinib) is being developed by Exelixis has recently reported positive results from its Phase 3 trial
	and is expected to receive FDA approval for second-line mRCC in 2016. In addition, if a standalone therapy for mRCC were developed
	that demonstrated improved efficacy over currently marketed first-line therapies with a favorable safety profile and without the
	need for combination therapy, such a therapy might pose a significant competitive threat to AGS-003.

	We are currently conducting our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy.
	We elected to study AGS-003 in clinical trials in combination with sunitinib due in part to sunitinib being the current standard
	of care for first-line treatment of mRCC. Although we do not expect to seek FDA approval of AGS-003 solely in combination with
	sunitinib and have provided that, under the protocol for the ADAPT trial, investigators may discontinue sunitinib due to disease
	progression or toxicity and initiate second-line treatment with other approved compatible therapies, if we obtain approval by the
	FDA, such FDA approval may be limited to the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib. In such event, the commercial success of AGS-003
	would be linked to the commercial success of sunitinib. As a result, if sunitinib ceases to be the standard of care for first-line
	treatment of mRCC or another event occurs that adversely affects sales of sunitinib, the commercial success of AGS-003 may be adversely
	affected.

	in price pressure in the HIV therapeutics market and could affect the pricing of AGS-004. Currently, there are no approved therapies

	The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug
	products vary widely from country to country. In the United States, recently passed legislation may significantly change the approval
	requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval
	of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product
	licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental
	control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular
	country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods,
	and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations
	may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain regulatory
	approval.

	Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the
	extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration
	authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third party payors, such as private health
	insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A
	primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third party payors
	have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly,
	third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging
	the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize
	and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product
	candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because
	of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. If reimbursement is not available
	or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain
	marketing approval.

	There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs,
	and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities
	outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or
	at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels
	for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates
	may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already
	set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced
	by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of
	laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.
	Third party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies.
	Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved
	products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to
	commercialize products and our overall financial condition.

	Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. Furthermore, these third parties may

	with our plan to build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility, we entered into a lease agreement with the developer,
	TKC LXXII, LLC, or TKC. Under the lease agreement, we agreed to lease certain land and an approximately 124,000 square-foot building
	to be constructed in Durham County, North Carolina. This facility would house our corporate headquarters and commercial manufacturing.
	The shell of the new facility was constructed on a build-to-suit basis in accordance with agreed upon specifications and plans
	and was completed in June 2015. A portion of the build-out and equipping of the interior of the facility began in the second half
	of 2015.

	Under the lease agreement, we had an option to purchase the property. In February 2015,
	we exercised this purchase option and entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with TKC. The purchase price to be paid by us
	is $7.6 million plus the amount of any additional costs incurred by TKC as a result of changes requested by us, for which we have
	paid $1.7 million as of December 31, 2015, and the amount of any improvement allowances advanced to us by TKC prior to the closing.
	Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we had until February 16, 2016 to consummate the purchase of the property.
	We are currently in discussions with TKC to extend the period for purchasing the property as we will need to obtain additional
	funding to consummate the purchase of the property. If we purchase the property, upon the closing, the lease agreement will terminate.
	If TKC is unwilling to extend the period, TKC will have no further obligation to sell the property to us.

	The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly
	uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result,
	the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors&#8217; patent rights are highly uncertain.
	Our and our licensors&#8217; pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology

	Third parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent

	A U.S. patent may be infringed by anyone who, without authorization, practices the patented process in the United States or imports
	a product made by a process covered by the U.S. patent. In foreign countries, however, importation of a product made by a process
	patented in that country may not constitute an infringing activity, which would limit our ability to enforce our process patents
	against importers in that country. Furthermore, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries,
	do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. This could make it difficult for us to stop
	the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. If competitors are able to use
	our technologies, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.

	Furthermore, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind
	the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until
	18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to
	make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the
	first to file for patent protection of such inventions.

	Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States, the
	first to invent the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application
	is generally entitled to the patent. Under the America Invents Act, or AIA, enacted in September 2011, the United States moved
	to a first inventor to file system in March 2013. The United States Patent and Trademark Office only recently finalized the rules
	relating to these changes and courts have yet to address the new provisions. These changes could increase the costs and uncertainties
	surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patent rights. Furthermore, we may
	become involved in interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, or other post-grant proceedings, such as reissue, reexamination
	or inter partes review proceedings, which may challenge our patent rights or the patent rights of others. For example, we have
	filed an application for reissue of one of our U.S. patents directed towards methods of manufacture of dendritic cells from monocytes
	stored for more than six hours and up to four days without freezing. An adverse determination in any such proceeding or litigation
	could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and
	compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing
	third party patent rights.

	Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue
	in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide
	us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar
	or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope,
	validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United
	States and abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit
	our ability to or stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products,
	or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development,
	testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after
	such candidates are commercialized. For example, certain of the U.S. patents we exclusively license from Duke University expire
	as early as 2016 and the European and Japanese patents exclusively licensed from Duke University expire in 2017. As a result, our
	owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar
	or identical to ours.

	Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing

	requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other
	post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality
	assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, cGTP requirements, requirements regarding the distribution of
	samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject
	to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements
	for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates
	the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance
	with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding
	off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for

	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
	Act of 2003, or Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation
	expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales
	prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that
	will be covered in any therapeutic class in certain cases. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this and other more
	recent legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that is provided for any approved products. While the Medicare
	Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy
	and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the
	Medicare Modernization Act or other more recent legislation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping
	law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against
	fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on
	the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October&nbsp;1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises
	the definition of &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid
	drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription
	drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices
	with health care practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state
	agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform
	Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and
	may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.

	will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes
	on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the

	With the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or
	BPCIA, as part of the Health Care Reform Law, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological
	products was created. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar
	biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as &#8220;interchangeable&#8221; based on its similarity to an existing
	brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or approved
	by the FDA until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product was approved under a BLA. The new
	law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation
	and meaning is subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such
	processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.

	We believe that if any of our product candidates were to be approved as biological products
	under a BLA, such approved products should qualify for the four-year and 12-year periods of exclusivity. However, there is a risk
	that the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten these exclusivity periods as proposed by President Obama,
	or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating
	the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will
	be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological
	products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.

	Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish

	registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 within the prescribed
	period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly
	and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants
	and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps
	to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement
	a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material

	We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act, and may
	remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and
	plan to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
	growth companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404
	of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company
	Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&#8217;s report providing additional
	information about the audit and the financial statements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions
	from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute
	payments not previously approved. In our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not include all of the executive compensation
	related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will
	find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as
	a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

	of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company
	to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have
	irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be
	subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

	This facility is being built to house our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility. The shell of the new facility
	was constructed on a build-to-suit basis by TKC in accordance with agreed upon specifications and plans as set forth in the Lease

	which&nbsp;we have paid $1.7&nbsp;million as of December 31, 2015, and the amount of any improvement allowances advanced to&nbsp;us
	by TKC prior to the closing. Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we had until February 16, 2016 to consummate the
	purchase of the property. We are currently in discussions with TKC to extend the period for purchasing the property as we will
	need to obtain additional funding to consummate the purchase of the property. If we purchase the property, upon the closing, the
	Lease Agreement will terminate. If TKC is unwilling to extend the period, TKC will have no further obligation to sell the property

	The graph set forth below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on an initial
	investment of $100 in our common stock between February 7, 2014, the date on which our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ
	Global Market, and December&nbsp;31, 2015, with the comparative cumulative total return of such amount on (i)&nbsp;the NASDAQ Composite
	Index and (ii)&nbsp;the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index over the same period. We have not paid any cash dividends and, therefore, the
	cumulative total return calculation for us is based solely upon our stock price appreciation or depreciation and does not include
	any reinvestment of cash dividends. The graph assumes our closing sales price on February 7, 2014 of $8.00 per share as the initial
	value of our common stock.

	Our most advanced product candidate is AGS-003, which we are developing for the treatment
	of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or mRCC, and other cancers. We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of
	AGS-003 plus sunitinib or another targeted therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed mRCC under a special protocol assessment,
	or SPA, with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We refer to this trial as the ADAPT trial. We initiated the ADAPT trial
	in January 2013, dosed the first patient in May 2013 and completed enrollment of the trial in July 2015. Based upon the actual
	rate of enrollment and projected event rate as defined in the protocol, we anticipate having a sufficient number of events to permit
	the primary analysis and assessment of overall survival to occur in the first half of 2017. We are also supporting investigator-initiated
	Phase 2 trials in patients with early stage RCC and non-small cell lung cancer and plan to support investigator-initiated trials
	of AGS-003 in mRCC and muscle invasive bladder cancer.

	In April 2015, we entered into stock purchase agreements with Tianyi
	Lummy International Holdings Group, Ltd., or Tianyi Lummy, and China BioPharma Capital I, L.P., or China BioPharma. Pursuant
	to the purchase agreements, the purchasers purchased an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a per share

	of approximately $20 million, within 31 days of and subject to reaching full enrollment of our ADAPT trial, receiving

	In August 2014,&nbsp;we entered into a lease agreement, or the
	Lease Agreement, with TKC LXXII, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company, or TKC. Under the Lease Agreement, we agreed
	to lease certain land and an approximately&nbsp;124,000 square-foot building to be constructed on approximately 11 acres in Durham
	County, North Carolina. This facility is being built to house our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility. The
	lease for the current facility expires in November 2016. The shell of the new facility was constructed on a build-to-suit basis
	by TKC in accordance with agreed upon specifications and plans as set forth in the Lease Agreement, at the expense of TKC, other
	than those costs resulting from changes requested by us for which we have paid $1.7 million as of December 31, 2015, as further

	The term of the Lease Agreement is 10&nbsp;years from the commencement date of July 1, 2015.
	We have an option to extend the Lease Agreement by six five-year renewal terms. Initial rent is $46,917 per month, subject to certain

	Under the Lease Agreement, we had an option to purchase the property. In February 2015, we

	$7.6 million plus the amount of any additional costs incurred by TKC as a result of changes requested by us, for which we have
	paid $1.7 million as of December 31, 2015, and the amount of any improvement allowances advanced to us by TKC prior to the closing.
	Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we had until February 16, 2016 to consummate the purchase of the property.
	We are currently in discussions with TKC to extend the period for purchasing the property as we will need to obtain additional
	funding to consummate the purchase of the property. If we purchase the property, upon the closing, the Lease Agreement will terminate.
	If TKC is unwilling to extend the period, TKC will have no further obligation to sell the property to us.

	In consideration for the manufacturing license, Medinet paid us $1.0 million. Medinet
	also loaned us $9.0 million in connection with us entering into the agreement. We have agreed to use these funds in the development
	and manufacturing of AGS-003 and the other products. Medinet also agreed to pay us milestone payments of up to a total of $9.0
	million upon the achievement of developmental and regulatory milestones and $5.0 million upon the achievement of a sales milestone
	related to AGS-003 and these products. If Medinet exercises the sale option, it will pay us $1.0 million, as well as royalties

	We borrowed the $9.0 million pursuant to an unsecured promissory note that bears interest

	the terms of the note and the license agreement, any milestone payments related to the developmental and regulatory milestones

	to make and sell Arcelis products in Japan for the treatment of cancer. In such event, the amounts owing under the loan as of December&nbsp;31,

	We recorded the $1.0&nbsp;million payment from Medinet as a deferred liability. In addition,
	because the $9.0 million promissory note was issued at a below market interest rate, we allocated the proceeds of the loan between

	.&nbsp;We are developing AGS-003 for the treatment of
	mRCC and other cancers. We are currently conducting the ADAPT trial of AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy for the treatment
	of newly diagnosed mRCC under an SPA with the FDA. We initiated the ADAPT trial in January 2013 and dosed the first patient in
	May 2013. In July 2015 we completed enrollment in the trial, enrolling 462 patients with the goal of generating 290 events for
	the primary endpoint of overall survival. We enrolled these patients at approximately 130 clinical sites in North America and Europe.
	Based upon the actual rate of enrollment and projected event rate as defined in the protocol, we anticipate having a sufficient
	number of events to permit the primary analysis and assessment of overall survival to occur in the first half of 2017.

	enrolled in this trial and that initial data will be available in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the trial, patients undergo
	a core needle biopsy of their renal tumor prior to nephrectomy in order to provide material to extract patient-specific tumor
	RNA for the manufacture of AGS-003. We expect the investigator to have preliminary data from this trial later this year with
	respect to the safety, feasibility and initial immunologic effects of AGS-003 relative to the induction of memory T cells. In

	&nbsp;We are developing AGS-004 for the treatment of HIV and are focusing

	eradicate the virus. We are supporting an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 in up to 12 adult HIV patients
	to evaluate the use of AGS-004 in combination with one of these latency reversing therapies for this purpose at the University
	of North Carolina. The patient clinical costs from the first stage of this trial are being funded by Collaboratory of AIDS Researchers

	infected with HIV who have otherwise healthy immune systems and have been treated with ART since birth or shortly thereafter and,
	as a result, are lacking the antiviral memory T-cells to combat the virus. The commencement of this trial is subject to supportive

	In September 2014, we entered into the Loan Agreement
	with the Lenders under which we could borrow up to $25.0 million in two tranches of $12.5 million each. We borrowed the first tranche
	of $12.5 million upon the closing of the transaction in September 2014 and borrowed the second tranche of $12.5 million on August
	7, 2015, following completion of enrollment of the ADAPT trial. The per annum interest rate for each tranche is a floating rate
	equal to 9.25% plus the amount by which the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, exceeds 0.50% (effectively a floating
	rate equal to 8.75% plus the one-month LIBOR Rate).&nbsp;The total per annum interest rate shall not exceed 10.75%.

	In December 2013, in connection with the license agreement with Medinet,
	as described in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
	Data,&#8221; we borrowed $9.0 million pursuant to an unsecured promissory note that bears interest at a rate of 3.0% per annum.
	The principal and interest under the note are due and payable on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the note and the license
	agreement, any milestone payments related to the developmental and regulatory milestones that become due will be applied first
	to the repayment of the loan. We have the right to prepay the loan at any time. If we have not repaid the loan by December 31,
	2018, then we have agreed to grant to Medinet a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to make and sell Arcelis products in Japan
	for the treatment of cancer. In such event, the amounts owing under the loan as of December 18, 2018 may constitute pre-paid royalties
	under the license or would be due and payable. Royalties under this license would be paid until the expiration of the licensed
	patent rights in Japan at a rate to be negotiated. If we and Medinet cannot agree on the royalty rate, Medinet has agreed to submit
	the matter to arbitration. Because the $9.0 million promissory note was issued at a below market interest rate, we allocated the
	proceeds of the loan between the license agreement and the debt at the time of issuance. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2013,
	we recorded $6.9 million to notes payable, based upon an effective interest rate of 8.0%, and $2.1 million as a deferred liability.
	As of December 31, 2014, we recorded $7.6 million to notes payable, including $0.7 million accrued interest recorded during the
	year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $1.0 million milestone payment as deferred
	revenue under this license agreement and reduced the related note payable by $0.8 million and the deferred liability by $0.2 million.
	As of December 31, 2015, we recorded $7.5 million to notes payable, including $1.3 million of accrued interest.

	We accrue our expenses related to clinical trials based on our estimates of the services
	received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical
	trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may
	result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients
	and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will
	be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the
	level of effort varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. If we do not identify costs that we have begun
	to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses
	could differ from our estimates. We do not anticipate the future settlement of existing accruals to differ materially from our
	estimates.

	The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. Our historical share option

	Prior to February 7, 2014, the date our common stock began publicly trading following
	our initial public offering, the fair value of our common stock for purposes of determining the exercise price for stock option

	on a number of objective and subjective factors consistent with the methodologies outlined in the American Institute of Certified
	Public Accountants Practice Aid,
<I>
	Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation

	The table below summarizes our direct research and development expenses by program for
	the periods indicated. Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to
	investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs, including in connection with our clinical trials, and related clinical
	trial fees. Research and development expenses also include commercial manufacturing development costs consisting primarily of costs
	incurred under our development agreements with Invetech and Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, or Saint-Gobain, to
	develop and provide prototypes of the automated production system to be used for the manufacture of our Arcelis-based products.
	We have been developing AGS-003 and AGS-004, in parallel, and typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple
	research and development programs. We do not allocate salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefit or other indirect costs
	related to our research and development function to specific product candidates. Those expenses are included in &#8220;Indirect
	research and development expense&#8221; in the table below.

	Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and
	short-term investments as of December 31, 2015, the $19.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants
	at the initial closing of our March 2016 private placement and the anticipated funding under our NIH and NIAID contract, will
	enable us to fund our&nbsp;operating expenses into the third quarter of 2016. If the second and third tranches of our March
	2016 private placement financing occur, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, the estimated $59.0 million of net proceeds from the financing and the anticipated funding under our
	contract with the NIH and NIAID, will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the second quarter of 2017, when we
	expect final data from the ADAPT trial.

	We expect that these funds will be sufficient to enable us to support the ongoing and planned
	investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003, certain of the manufacturing costs of the ongoing phase 2 clinical trial of
	AGS-004 for HIV eradication in patients with early stage RCC and certain costs related to commercial manufacturing. We expect that
	these funds will not, however, be sufficient to enable us to complete required activities in preparation for the submission of
	a BLA to the FDA for AGS-003, to perform pre-commercialization activities for AGS-003 or to commercially launch AGS-003. These
	expectations are based on our current operating plan under which we plan to implement measures to reduce our operating expenses,
	including reductions in spending for activities in preparation for submission of a BLA. These reductions may include reductions
	in planned spending related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls, process validation, quality, supply management and commercial
	preparation. Under our plan, we also intend to seek to refinance our existing venture loan facility with Horizon Technology Finance
	Corporation, or Horizon, and Fortress Credit Co LLC, or Fortress, and to enter into collaborations for the development, marketing
	and distribution of AGS-003 outside North America and of our non-oncology product candidates, including AGS-004. If we are unable
	to refinance our venture loan facility or enter into any such collaborations, we may be required to implement additional measures
	to materially reduce our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business and operations. It is also possible that
	our available funds will not enable us to obtain final data from the ADAPT trial because the actual costs and timing of clinical
	trials are difficult to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays. We have no external sources of funds other than
	our contract with the NIH and NIAID for the development of AGS-004.

	We also will need to obtain significant financing if we decide to purchase, build out
	and equip a new commercial manufacturing facility. Our preliminary estimate indicates that we will require approximately an
	additional $30.0 million prior to the commercialization of AGS-003 to purchase, build out and equip the commercial
	manufacturing facility. These costs do not include the costs to implement the automated manufacturing process. We are
	actively exploring financing arrangements in connection with the planned purchase, build out and equipping of the commercial
	manufacturing facility and are in discussions with developers, lenders and other potential financing sources regarding
	potential financial support. Unless we select an alternative plan for the commercial supply of our products, we expect to
	enter into such arrangements during the second quarter of 2016 and that such arrangements will likely involve material
	obligations and debt liabilities. We are also exploring alternatives for the commercial supply of our products, including
	building out and equipping our current facility for commercial manufacture, leasing and equipping an existing manufacturing
	space that would be built out for commercial manufacture, and engaging a contract manufacturer to supply AGS-003 on a
	commercial scale on our behalf. We will also need to obtain additional financing with any of these alternatives. If we
	are unable to obtain additional financing when needed, in the required amounts or at all, we may not be able to complete
	the planned purchase, build-out and equipping of the new commercial facility or be able to lease and equip an existing
	commercial facility, or may be delayed in doing so.

	Under the Lease Agreement with TKC, we agreed to lease certain land and an approximately&nbsp;124,000

	of any improvement allowances advanced to us by TKC prior to the closing. Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we
	had until February 16, 2016 to consummate the purchase of the property. We are currently in discussions with TKC to extend the

	In October 2014, we entered into a development agreement with Invetech. The
	development agreement supersedes and replaces the development agreement entered into by the parties in July 2005.&nbsp;Under
	the development agreement, Invetech agreed to continue to develop and provide prototypes of the automated production system
	to be used for the manufacture of our&nbsp;Arcelis-based products, or the Production Systems. Development services will
	be performed on a proposal by proposal basis. Invetech has agreed to defer 30% of its fees, but such deferral may not
	exceed $5,000,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred fees (plus interest of 7% per annum) would become payable either, at our option, in a
	lump sum within 90 days of the &#8220;Sunset Date Trigger Event&#8221; or pursuant to an installment plan (either
	in&nbsp;four installments payable within the first year or&nbsp;eight installments payable within the first two years after
	the &#8220;Sunset Date Trigger Event&#8221;).&nbsp; The &#8220;Sunset Date Trigger Event&#8221; is December 31, 2016 or June
	30, 2016 if, prior to such date, our ADAPT trial is closed early following the interim review at 50% or 75% of events, due to
	a positive efficacy outcome in favor of the active treatment arm that contains AGS-003. Invetech is entitled to a 10%
	bonus payment if this clinical trial is closed early indicating positive efficacy and Invetech has timely completed all
	activities up to the time of such early closure. We are planning to negotiate the terms of the development agreement related
	to the deferred fees and bonus payment.

	The development agreement requires the parties to discuss in good faith Invetech&#8217;s

	of Production Systems, components, subsystems and spare parts for commercial use.&nbsp;Once that obligation has been satisfied,
	we have the right to have a third party supply Production Systems for use in manufacturing commercial product, provided that Invetech
	has a right of first refusal with respect to any offer by a third party and we may not accept an offer from a third party unless
	that offer is at a price that is less than that offered by Invetech and otherwise under substantially the same or better terms.&nbsp;We
	will own all intellectual property arising from the development services (with the exception of existing Invetech intellectual
	property incorporated therein-under which we will have a license).&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of the development agreement will continue

	In January 2015, we entered into a development agreement with Saint-Gobain. Under the
	agreement, Saint-Gobain will develop a range of disposables for use in our automated production systems to be used for the
	manufacture of our Arcelis-based products, which we refer to as the Disposables. We do not expect the fees and expenses
	incurred under the Saint-Gobain Agreement to exceed $6,000,000. We made a payment of $400,000, and Saint-Gobain has agreed to
	defer one half of the fees and expenses incurred until the earlier of (i) the date upon which we have raised an additional
	$60.0 million in capital, and (ii) September 30, 2016. The Saint-Gobain agreement required the parties to execute a
	commercial supply agreement under which Saint-Gobain would become the exclusive supplier of Disposables for the manufacture
	of our products treating solid tumors for no less than fifteen years by December 31, 2015. The parties are in discussions to
	extend this date and to finalize the commercial supply agreement. The Saint-Gobain agreement will continue until December 31,
	2016, but can be terminated earlier by written agreement of the parties because of a material default, including the failure
	to execute the commercial supply agreement, or a failure to achieve a performance milestone.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had U.S. federal and state, and Canadian federal and

	These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2016, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015,

	Our primary exposure to market risk is limited to our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
	investments, all of which have maturities of one year or less. The related interest income sensitivity is affected by changes in
	the general level of short-term U.S. interest rates. We primarily invest in high quality, short-term marketable debt securities
	issued by high quality financial and industrial companies.

<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
	&nbsp;
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
	Due to the short-term duration and low risk profile of our cash, cash equivalents and
	short-term investments, an immediate 10.0% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our portfolio.
	Accordingly, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of
	a sudden change in market interest rates on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
	We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments have significant
	risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments do not contain excessive
	risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in fair value.
	In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess
	of federally insured limits.

	We are also exposed to market risk from the potential increase in short-term U.S. interest
	rates under our Loan Agreement with Horizon and Fortress. The per annum interest rate for each tranche is a floating rate equal
	to 9.25% plus the amount by which the one-month LIBOR exceeds 0.50% (effectively a floating rate equal to 8.75% plus the one-month
	LIBOR Rate).&nbsp;The total per annum interest rate shall not exceed 10.75%. Since the one month LIBOR Rate has been less than
	0.50% since the Loan Agreement was executed in September 2014, our interest rate has been and is currently 9.25%. If the one month
	LIBOR Rate increases to 2.0% or greater, the interest expense we will incur under the Loan Agreement will increase by $375,000
	per year.

	All of our other debt instruments and liabilities that incur interest charges do so at
	fixed-rates. We incur interest expense at fixed rates under the unsecured promissory note payable to Medinet (3% per annum), the
	manufacturing research and development obligations payable to Invetech (7% per annum), and other notes payable (8.31% per annum).

	Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our

	the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as set forth in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e)
	and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of
	a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
	that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
	in the rules and forms promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). Disclosure controls and procedures
	include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
	in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including
	its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
	Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
	of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
	controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our chief
	executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
	at the reasonable assurance level.

	Applicable NASDAQ rules require a majority of a listed company&#8217;s board of directors
	to be comprised of independent directors. In addition, NASDAQ rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member
	of a listed company&#8217;s audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent and that audit
	committee members also satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
	or the Exchange Act, and that compensation committee members satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange
	Act. Under applicable NASDAQ rules, a director only qualifies as an &#8220;independent director&#8221; if, in the opinion of our
	board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in
	carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of
	an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board
	of directors, or any other board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee
	from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.
	In addition, in affirmatively determining the independence of any director who will serve on a listed company&#8217;s compensation
	committee, Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act requires that a company&#8217;s board of directors must consider all factors specifically
	relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to such company which is material to that director&#8217;s ability
	to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including: the source of compensation
	to the director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by such company to the director, and whether

	On December&nbsp;20, 2013, we adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that
	applies to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, or persons
	performing similar functions. The code became effective on February&nbsp;6, 2014. We have posted a current copy of the code on
	our website, www.argostherapeutics.com. In addition, we intend to post on our website all disclosures that are required by law
	or NASDAQ stock market listing standards concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of the code.

	Section&nbsp;16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors,
	executive officers and holders of more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports
	of ownership of our equity securities on a Form 3 and reports of changes in such ownership on a Form 4 or Form 5. Based solely
	on our review of copies of such filings by our directors, executive officers, and 10% shareholders, or written representations
	from certain of those persons, we believe that all filings required to be made by those persons during fiscal 2015 were timely
	made, except for late filings by each of Messrs. Abbey and Nicolette and Mrs. Winterbottom. Each of these officers inadvertently
	filed a Form 4 reporting acquisitions of common stock after the deadline due to administrative errors.

	Base Salary
</I>
	.&nbsp;We use base salaries to recognize the experience, skills,
	knowledge and responsibilities required of all our employees, including our named executive officers. None of our named executive
	officers is currently party to an employment agreement or other agreement or arrangement that provides for automatic or scheduled
	increases in base salary. In 2015, we paid an annual base salary of $450,000 to Mr.&nbsp;Abbey, $325,000 to Dr.&nbsp;Nicolette
	and $290,000 to Ms. Winterbottom. These annual base salaries have not been increased for 2016.

<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
<I>
	Annual Bonus
</I>
	.&nbsp;In addition to base salaries, our executive
	officers are eligible to receive annual discretionary cash bonuses based on the achievement of corporate objectives and individual
	performance. Bonuses are typically prorated on a monthly basis, as applicable, for executive officers who commence employment after
	the beginning of the year. Our executive officers&#8217; annual bonus opportunities are generally set as a specified percentage
	of annual base salary. The 2015 annual target bonus amount for each of our current executive officers was 60% of base salary for
	Mr. Abbey, 40% of base salary for Dr. Nicolette and 35% of base salary for Ms. Winterbottom. In determining annual bonuses, we
	have generally attributed 85% of the target bonus to the achievement of specified corporate objectives and 15% to the individual&#8217;s
	effectiveness in helping us achieve our corporate objectives or other individual performance criteria. The annual corporate objectives
	are recommended by our chief executive officer and approved by the compensation committee and the board of directors. Historically,
	annual bonuses have been determined by the compensation committee and ratified by the non-employee directors in December of each
	year and paid by the end of December of the year in which they were determined. Due to the limitations on our cash resources, in
	lieu of annual cash bonuses to our named executive officers for 2015, we granted to each of our named executive officers restricted
	stock awards under our 2014 stock incentive plan having a value based on the closing market price on January 8, 2016 equal to $202,500
	(90,401 shares) to Mr.&nbsp;Abbey, $108,875 (48,604 shares) to Dr.&nbsp;Nicolette and $73,270 (32,709 shares) to Ms. Winterbottom.
	Each of the restricted stock awards is subject to a lapsing right of repurchase in our favor, which will lapse with respect to
	100% of the underlying shares on November 20, 2016, assuming such executive is still providing services to us on such date.

	Equity Incentive Awards
</I>
	.&nbsp;Our equity award program is the primary vehicle
	for offering long-term incentives to our executives. We believe that equity awards provide our executives with a strong link to
	our long-term performance, create an ownership culture and help to align the interests of our executives and our stockholders.
	To date, we have used stock option grants for this purpose because we believe they are an effective means by which to align the
	long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. The use of options also can provide tax and other
	advantages to our executive officers relative to other forms of equity compensation. We believe that our equity awards are an important
	retention tool for our executive officers, as well as for our other employees.

	We award stock options broadly to our employees, including to our non-executive employees.
	Grants to our executives and other employees are made at the discretion of our board of directors and are not made at any specific
	time period during a fiscal year. All of our named executive officers have received stock option grants under our 2008 stock incentive
	plan or our 2014 stock incentive plan, each of which is described below. No further options may be granted under the 2008 plan.

<P STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN: 12PT 0 0">
	Initial option grants to our executive officers are generally set forth in their employment
	agreements. These initial grants are the product of negotiation with the executive officer, but we generally seek to establish
	equity ownership levels that we believe are commensurate with the equity stakes held by executive officers serving in similar roles
	at comparable biopharmaceutical companies. In addition, from time to time in connection with corporate finance transactions and
	at other times as our compensation committee and board of directors deem appropriate, we provide subsequent option grants to those
	executive officers determined to be performing well.

	of a change of control. Additional information regarding the effect of accelerated vesting upon a change in control with respect
	to our named executive officers is discussed below under &#8220;&#8212;&nbsp;Agreements with our Named Executive Officers.&#8221;

	Tax Limitations on Incentive Stock Options

	.&nbsp;Incentive stock options are subject

	granted to any person who, at the time of the grant, owns or is deemed to own stock possessing more than 10% of our total combined
	voting power or that of any of our affiliates must have an exercise price equal at least to 110% of the fair market value of the
	stock subject to the option on the date of grant, and the term of the incentive stock option may not exceed five years from the
	date of grant. The aggregate fair market value, determined at the time of grant, of shares of our common stock with respect to
	incentive stock options that are exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year under all of our stock

	PIPE Financing.
</I>
	On March&nbsp;4, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement
	with certain investors pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of up to $60 million of our common stock and
	warrants to purchase shares of common stock in a private placement financing. The financing will take place in up to three tranches.&nbsp;At
	the closing of the initial tranche in March 2016, we sold and the investors purchased, for a total purchase price of approximately
	$19.9 million, a total of 3,652,430 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase a total of 2,739,323 shares of common stock
	(0.75 shares of common stock for each share of common stock purchased), based on a purchase price per share of common stock and
	accompanying warrant equal to $5.44375.&nbsp; At the second closing, we have agreed to sell and the investors have agreed to purchase,
	for an additional purchase price of approximately $29.8 million, a total of 5,478,672 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase
	a total of 4,109,005 shares of common stock at the same price and on the same terms as the first tranche. &nbsp;The second closing
	is conditioned on the independent data monitoring committee for the ADAPT trial at or following the independent data monitoring
	committee&#8217;s next regular meeting (currently scheduled for June 2016) recommending that we continue the ADAPT trial or discontinue
	the ADAPT trial based on favorable efficacy data.&nbsp; The warrants to be issued in each closing will have an exercise price of
	$5.35 per share and expire five years from the date of issuance.&nbsp;Our stockholder, Pharmstandard International S.A., or Pharmstandard,
	has also agreed pursuant to the securities purchase agreement that, at our option following the satisfaction of certain conditions,
	including the independent data monitoring committee having made a recommendation at or following its next regular meeting after
	the June 2016 independent data monitoring committee meeting (currently anticipated to be held in November or December 2016), that
	we continue the ADAPT trial or discontinue the ADAPT trial based on favorable efficacy data, and our cash position at such time,
	Pharmstandard shall purchase at the third closing up to approximately $10.3 million of shares of common stock (without warrants)
	at a price per share to be determined pursuant to an agreed upon formulation.&nbsp; The dollar amount committed to be purchased
	by Pharmstandard at the third closing is subject to reduction on a dollar-for-dollar basis for certain cash amounts raised by us
	after the initial closing through equity or debt financings or collaborations.&nbsp; All three closings are subject to the satisfaction
	of certain customary closing conditions.

	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
	listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Argos
	Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash
	flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
	appearing under Item 15(a)(1) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
	conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule
	are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
	and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
	standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
	includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
	the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
	that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered
	recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a
	going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include
	any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Argos Therapeutics, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), was incorporated in the State of Delaware
	on May&nbsp;8, 1997. The Company is an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of fully individualized
	immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer using its Arcelis technology platform. The Company&#8217;s most advanced product candidate,
	AGS-003, is being evaluated in the pivotal ADAPT Phase 3 clinical trial (the &#8220;ADAPT trial&#8221;) for the treatment of metastatic
	renal cell carcinoma (&#8220;mRCC&#8221;). The Company is also developing a separate Arcelis-based product candidate, AGS-004,
	for the treatment of HIV, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial aimed at HIV eradication in adult patients.

	The Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
	Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments
	in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses in each year since inception and as of December 31, 2015, had
	an accumulated deficit of $279.0 million. Also, as of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s current assets totaled $8.8 million
	compared with current liabilities of $8.2 million, and the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.2
	million. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements for the
	year ended December 31, 2015 do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
	of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company&#8217;s ability

	Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product revenues, it
	expects to seek to raise additional funds through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government contracts, government

	alliances and licensing arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate funds in these manners,
	on terms acceptable to the Company, on a timely basis or at all. The failure of the Company to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable
	terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition

	Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders

	stock, stock options and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted

<I>
	Leases (Topic

</I>
	&nbsp;("ASU 2016-02"). The provisions of ASU 2016-02 set out the principles for the recognition, measurement,
	presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees
	to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the
	lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized
	based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required
	to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
	Leases with a term of 12 month or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. Topic 842
	supersedes the previous leave standard, Topic 840&nbsp;

	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes

	issued for annual periods beginning after&nbsp;December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application
	is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual report period. The amendments in this ASU may be applied
	either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented. We adopted this standard
	as of December 31, 2015 with prospective application. As a result, we reclassified our deferred tax assets classified as current

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, the Company held certain assets that are required
	to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These assets include money market funds included in cash equivalents and short-term
	investments in corporate debt securities. The Company&#8217;s short-term investments are classified as available-for sale investments.
	As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s only short-term investment in a corporate debt security had a contractual maturity
	of January 25, 2016. The valuation of these financial instruments uses a three tiered approach, which requires that fair value
	measurements be classified and disclosed in one of three tiers. These tiers are: Level&nbsp;1, defined as quoted prices in active
	markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level&nbsp;2, defined as valuations based on observable inputs other than those included
	in Level&nbsp;1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable
	or can be corroborated by observable input data; and Level&nbsp;3, defined as valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting
	the Company&#8217;s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.

	The Company&#8217;s Level 1 assets consist of money-market funds and restricted cash
	in a deposit account at a bank. The method used to estimate the fair value of the Level 1 assets is based on observable market
	data, as these money-market funds are publicly-traded. The Company&#8217;s Level 2 assets consist of short-term debt instruments
	in corporate debt securities valued using independent pricing services which normally derive security prices from recently reported
	trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments based on significant observable transactions. As of each balance
	sheet date, observable market inputs may include trade information, broker or dealer quotes, bids, offers or a combination of these
	data sources. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 assets.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had U.S. federal and state, and Canadian federal
	and provincial net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $199,443,200, $244,608,100, $5,479,100, and $5,479,100, respectively.
	These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2016, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015,
	the Company had U.S. federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $9,319,400 and $340,400, respectively. These credit
	carryforwards begin to expire in 2020 and 2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had Canadian investment tax
	credit carryforwards of approximately $29,400 that begin to expire in 2024. The utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit
	carryforwards may be subject to limitation under the rules regarding a change in stock ownership as determined by the Internal
	Revenue Code, and state and foreign tax laws. Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes annual
	limitations on the utilization of net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryforwards, other tax carryforwards, and certain built-in
	losses upon an ownership change as defined under that section. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions
	that increase the aggregate ownership of certain stockholders in the Company&#8217;s stock by more than 50 percentage points over
	a three year testing period. If the Company has undergone a Section&nbsp;382 ownership change, an annual limitation would be imposed
	on certain of the Company&#8217;s tax attributes, including NOL and capital loss carryforwards, and certain other losses, credits,
	deductions or tax basis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has not completed a formal study to determine whether there
	are 382 limitations that apply.

	On July 23, 2013, North Carolina enacted House Bill 998, which reduced the corporate
	income tax rate from 6.9% in 2013 to 6% in 2014 and to 5% in 2015. As a result of the new enacted tax rate, the Company adjusted
	its deferred tax assets in 2013 by applying the lower rate, which resulted in a decrease to the deferred tax assets and a corresponding
	decrease to the valuation allowance of $1,349,062.

	Medinet Loan.
</I>
	In December 2013, in connection with a license agreement currently
	with Medinet Co., Ltd and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MEDcell Co., Ltd. (together "Medinet"), as described in Note 12,
	the Company borrowed $9.0 million pursuant to an unsecured promissory note that bears interest at a rate of 3.0% per annum. The
	principal and interest under the note are due and payable on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the note and the license agreement,
	any milestone payments related to the developmental and regulatory milestones that become due will be applied first to the repayment
	of the loan. The Company has the right to prepay the loan at any time. If the Company has not repaid the loan by December 31, 2018,
	then the Company has agreed to grant to Medinet a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to make and sell Arcelis products in Japan
	for the treatment of cancer. In such event, the amounts owing under the loan as of December 18, 2018 may constitute pre-paid royalties
	under the license or would be due and payable. Royalties under this license would be paid until the expiration of the licensed
	patent rights in Japan at a rate to be negotiated. If the Company and Medinet cannot agree on the royalty rate, they have agreed
	to submit the matter to arbitration. Because the $9.0 million promissory note was issued at a below market interest rate, the Company
	allocated the proceeds of the loan between the license agreement and the debt at the time of issuance. Accordingly, as of the borrowing
	date, December 31, 2013, the Company recorded $6.9 million to notes payable, based upon an effective interest rate of 8.0%, and
	$2.1 million as a deferred liability.

	accrued interest. As of December 31, 2015, the total deferred liability associated with the Medinet note was $3.8 million (see

	ESPP&#8221;). Under the 2014 ESPP, on the offering commencement date of each plan period (the &#8220;Purchase Plan Period&#8221;),
	the Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a participant in the 2014 ESPP an option to purchase shares of Common
	Stock. The employee may authorize up to a maximum of 10% of his or her base pay to be deducted by the Company during the Purchase

	2, 2014 and ended on February 27, 2015. For the first Purchase Plan Period, 13,054 shares were purchased with employee withholdings

	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
	yield curve in effect on the date of grant. The dividend yield percentage is zero because the Company neither currently pays dividends
	nor intends to do so during the expected option term. The Company&#8217;s historical share option exercise experience does not
	provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term because of a lack of sufficient data. Therefore the Company
	estimates the expected term by using the simplified method allowed by the SEC. Expected stock price volatility is based on an average
	of several peer public companies. For purposes of identifying peer companies, the Company considered characteristics such as industry,
	length of trading history, similar vesting terms and in the-money option status. Upon the adoption of ASC 718, the Company was
	also required to estimate the level of forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that
	ultimately expect to vest. The Company performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting and
	recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate.
</FONT>
	The weighted average grant date fair
	value of stock options was $4.77, $5.54 and $5.76 in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.

	In August 2013, Pharmstandard International S.A. ("Pharmstandard"), purchased
	shares of the Company&#8217;s series E preferred stock. Concurrently with such purchase, the Company entered into an exclusive
	royalty-bearing license agreement with Pharmstandard. Under this license agreement, the Company granted Pharmstandard and its affiliates
	a license, with the right to sublicense, develop, manufacture and commercialize AGS-003 and other products for the treatment of
	human diseases, which are developed by Pharmstandard using the Company&#8217;s individualized immunotherapy platform, in the Russian
	Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan,
	which the Company refers to as the Pharmstandard Territory. The Company also provided Pharmstandard with a right of first negotiation

	Under the terms of the license agreement, Pharmstandard licensed the Company rights to
	clinical data generated by Pharmstandard under the agreement and granted the Company an option to obtain an exclusive license outside
	of the Pharmstandard Territory to develop and commercialize improvements to the Company&#8217;s Arcelis technology generated by
	Pharmstandard under the agreement, a non-exclusive worldwide royalty-free license to Pharmstandard improvements to manufacture
	products using the Company&#8217;s Arcelis technology and a license to specified follow-on licensed products generated by Pharmstandard
	outside of the Pharmstandard Territory, each on terms to be negotiated upon the Company&#8217;s request for a license. In addition,
	Pharmstandard agreed to pay the Company pass-through royalties on net sales of all licensed products in the low single digits until
	it has generated a specified amount of aggregate net sales. Once the net sales threshold is achieved, Pharmstandard will pay the
	Company royalties on net sales of specified licensed products, including AGS-003, in the low double digits below 20%. These royalty
	obligations last until the later of the expiration of specified licensed patent rights in a country or the twelfth anniversary
	of the first commercial sale in such country on a country by country basis and no further royalties on specified other licensed
	products. After the net sales threshold is achieved, Pharmstandard has the right to offset a portion of the royalties Pharmstandard
	pays to third parties for licenses to necessary third party intellectual property against the royalties that Pharmstandard pays
	to the Company.

	The agreement will terminate upon expiration of the royalty term, upon which all licenses

	terminate the agreement if Pharmstandard challenges or assists a third party in challenging specified patent rights of ours. If

	the Company&#8217;s licenses to improvements generated by Pharmstandard, upon which the Company may come to rely for the development

	This agreement was subsequently novated, amended and restated between the Company, Medinet Co., Ltd. and MEDcell Co., Ltd. in October

	substantive change in the underlying rights or obligations. Medinet Co., Ltd. and MEDcell Co., Ltd. together are referred to herein

	of AGS-003 and these other products for the treatment of mRCC. The Company refers to this license as the manufacturing license.
	In addition, under this agreement, the Company granted Medinet an option to acquire a nonexclusive, royalty-bearing license under

	the sale option, it may only manufacture AGS-003 and these other products for itself, its related parties and its sublicensees.
	During the term of the manufacturing license, the Company may not manufacture AGS-003 or these other products for the Company or

	Medinet also loaned the Company $9.0 million in connection with the Company entering into the agreement. The Company has agreed
	to use these funds in the development and manufacturing of AGS-003 and the other products. Medinet also agreed to pay the Company
	milestone payments of up to a total of $9.0 million upon the achievement of developmental and regulatory milestones and $5.0 million
	upon the achievement of a sales milestone related to AGS-003 and these products. The first milestone with a $1.0 million payment
	was achieved in July 2015 (see Notes 5 and 10). If Medinet exercises the sale option, it will pay the Company $1.0 million, as
	well as royalties on net sales at a rate to be negotiated until the later of the expiration of the licensed patent rights in Japan
	and the twelfth anniversary of the first commercial sale in Japan. If the Company and Medinet cannot agree on the royalty rate,

	In December 2013, in connection with the manufacturing license agreement with Medinet,
	the Company borrowed $9.0 million pursuant to an unsecured promissory note that bears interest at a rate of 3.0%&nbsp;per annum.
	The principal and interest under the note are due and payable on December&nbsp;31, 2018. Under the terms of the note and the manufacturing
	license agreement, any milestone payments related to the developmental and regulatory milestones that become due will be applied
	first to the repayment of the loan. The Company has the right to prepay the loan at any time. If the Company has not repaid the
	loan by December&nbsp;31, 2018, then the Company has agreed to grant to Medinet a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to make
	and sell Arcelis products in Japan for the treatment of cancer. In such event, the amounts owing under the loan as of December
	18, 2018 may constitute pre-paid royalties under the license or would be due and payable. Royalties under this license would be
	paid until the expiration of the licensed patent rights in Japan at a rate to be negotiated. If the Company and Medinet cannot

	The Company recorded the $1.0 million payment from Medinet as a deferred liability. In
	addition, because the $9.0 million promissory note was issued at a below market interest rate, the Company allocated the proceeds
	of the loan between the manufacturing license agreement and the debt at the time of issuance. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2013,
	the date of borrowing, the Company recorded $6.9 million to notes payable, based upon an effective interest rate of 8.0%, and $2.1
	million as a deferred liability. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a $1.0 million milestone payment
