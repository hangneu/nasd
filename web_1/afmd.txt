	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the
	United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act,
	the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which
	is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. In the European Union,
	or the EU, the European Commission may designate a product candidate as an orphan medicinal product if it is a medicine for the
	diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or very serious conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 persons
	in the European Union, or it is unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment
	needed for its development. We have received orphan drug designation for AFM13 for the treatment of HL in the United States and
	Europe, but orphan drug status may not ensure that we have market exclusivity in a particular market and there is no assurance
	we will be able to receive orphan drug designation for AFM11 or any additional product candidates. Further, the granting of a request
	for orphan drug designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval.

	Generally, if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation
	receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period
	of marketing exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the FDA from approving the marketing application of another
	drug for the same indication for that time period or precludes the EMA, and other national drug regulators in the EU, from accepting
	the marketing application for another medicinal product for the same indication. The applicable period is seven years in the United
	States and ten years in the European Union. The EU period can be reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria
	for orphan drug designation or if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. In
	the EU, orphan exclusivity may also be extended for an additional two years (i.e., a maximum of 12 years&rsquo; orphan exclusivity)
	if the product is approved on the basis of a dossier that includes pediatric clinical trial data generated in accordance with an
	approved paediatric investigation plan. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost in the United States if the FDA determines that the
	request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product
	to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

	Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for one or more of
	our products that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because exclusivity can be suspended under
	certain circumstances. In the United States, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve another drug
	for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective
	or makes a major contribution to patient care. In the European Union, orphan exclusivity will not prevent a marketing authorization
	being granted for a similar medicinal product in the same indication if the new product is

	Although all of our product candidates have undergone or will

	or anticipated. Immunotherapy and its method of action of harnessing the body&rsquo;s immune system, especially with respect to
	T-cell TandAbs, is powerful and could lead to serious side effects that we only discover in clinical trials. Unforeseen side effects
	from any of our product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if such side effects are rarer, after our
	product candidates have been approved by regulatory authorities and the approved product has been marketed, resulting in the exposure
	of additional patients. All of our product candidates are still in clinical or preclinical development. While our phase 1 clinical
	trials for AFM13 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, the results from future trials of AFM13 may not confirm these results.
	We have recently commenced our phase 1 clinical trial of AFM11, the primary objective of which is to assess safety. The harnessing
	of T-cells to kill tumors is risky and may have unintended consequences. So far we have not previously demonstrated that AFM11
	is safe in humans, and we cannot predict if the ongoing phase 1 clinical trial will do so.

	Successful and timely completion of clinical trials will require
	that we enroll a sufficient number of patient candidates. Trials may be subject to delays as a result of patient enrollment taking
	longer than anticipated or patient withdrawal. Patient enrollment depends on many factors, including the size and nature of the
	patient population, eligibility criteria for the trial, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the design of the clinical
	protocol, the availability of competing clinical trials, the availability of new drugs approved for the indication the clinical
	trial is investigating, and clinicians&rsquo; and patients&rsquo; perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being
	studied in relation to other available therapies. For example, our product candidate AFM13 has orphan drug designation for the
	treatment of HL, which means that the potential patient population is limited. Further, in our phase 2a clinical trial of AFM13
	as well as in our phase 1b combination study of AFM13 with Merck&rsquo;s anti PD-1 antibody KEYTRUDA

</SUP>
	(pembrolizumab)
	we plan to enroll patients with relapsed/refractory HL who have been treated with Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin), which is an even
	more limited population of patients. As we are developing AFM13 and AFM11 for patients for whom all other therapies have failed
	and who may not have long to live, patients may elect not to participate in our, or any, clinical trial. In addition, there are
	several other drugs potentially in development for the indications for which we may develop AFM13 and AFM11, and we may compete
	for patients with the sponsors of trials for those drugs. These factors may make it difficult for us to enroll enough patients
	to complete our clinical trials in a timely and cost-effective manner. Delays in the completion of any clinical trial of our product
	candidates will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and delay or potentially jeopardize
	our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. In addition, some of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in

	We expect that our TandAb and trispecific antibody platforms
	will serve as the basis for future product candidates and collaborations with pharmaceutical companies. Other companies also have
	developed platform technologies that compete with us. For example, Macrogenics is developing its DART platform, which enables the
	targeting of multiple receptors or cells by using a single molecule with an antibody-like structure. Ablynx is also developing
	such a platform aimed at multi-receptor targeting, which to date has not reached clinical testing.

	may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, European Commission or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly
	than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are

	In addition, our ability to compete in the future may be affected
	in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of biosimilar products. In March 2010, President
	Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
	Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain
	the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care
	and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
	The Health Care Reform Law also created a new regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars. Under the Health Care
	Reform Law, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is &ldquo;biosimilar to&rdquo; or
	&ldquo;interchangeable with&rdquo; a previously approved biological product or &ldquo;reference product,&rdquo; without the need
	to submit a full package of preclinical and clinical data. Under this new statutory scheme, an application for a biosimilar product
	may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar
	product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference
	product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA
	for such product containing the sponsor&rsquo;s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials
	to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. Furthermore, recent legislation has proposed that the 12-year exclusivity
	period for each a reference product may be reduced to seven years.

	Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be

	compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and
	patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
	In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we fail to stay at the forefront
	of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors
	may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or not economical.

	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
	and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
	The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based
	on average sale prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number
	of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost-reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could
	decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. If we successfully develop combinations of our product
	candidates with other potentially expensive agents, we may not achieve premium pricing for our products, which may impair our ability
	to achieve profitability.While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private
	payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction
	in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

	In addition, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things,
	increased rebates a manufacturer must pay to the Medicaid program, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers
	under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, established
	a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must provide 50% point-of-sale discounts on products
	covered under Part D and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage
	hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through
	bundled payment models. Further, the new law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription
	drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance were enacted, which may affect our business practices with health
	care practitioners. The goal of the Health Care Reform Law is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way
	health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement
	policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the Health Care Reform Law may result in downward
	pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we may charge for,
	any products we develop that receive regulatory approval. We also cannot predict the impact of the Health Care Reform Law on our
	business or financial condition as many of the Health Care Reform Law reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations
	implementing the statutory provisions, which has not yet occurred.

	Moreover, other legislative changes have also been proposed
	and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011,
	among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked
	with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required
	goals, thereby triggering the legislation&rsquo;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions
	to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, President
	Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare
	payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of
	limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result
	in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers
	and accordingly, our financial operations.

	The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including
	the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter
	for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches
	to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare
	budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant
	health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market
	products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities
	and affect our ability to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval.

	Potential future revenue may be derived from abroad, particularly

	the euro and these other currencies, which may also have a significant impact on our reported results of operations and cash flows
	from period to period. We have converted into euros only the portion of the IPO proceeds and the proceeds from our follow-on offering
	in May and the private placement in October 2015 that will be spent in euros according to our budget. If the euro/US$ ratio changes,
	we may be subject to foreign exchange-rate risk. Currently, we do not have any other exchange rate hedging measures in place. In
	addition, the possible abandonment of the euro by one or more members of the European Union could materially affect our business
	in the future. Despite measures taken by the European Union to provide funding to certain EU member states in financial difficulties
	and by a number of European countries to stabilize their economies and reduce their debt burdens, it is possible that the euro
	could be abandoned in the future as a currency by countries that have adopted its use. This could lead to the re-introduction of
	individual currencies in one or more EU member states, or in more extreme circumstances, the dissolution of the European Union.
	The effects on our business of a potential dissolution of the European Union, the exit of one or more EU member states from the
	European Union or the abandonment of the euro as a currency, are impossible to predict with certainty, and any such events could
	have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited

	and from general and administrative expenses that we have incurred while building our business infrastructure. We expect to continue
	to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development

	(the German Corporation
	Income Tax Act) and Section 10c of the
<I>

	ownership change, as defined by Section 8c of the
<I>

	, occurs and no exemption is applicable.
	Generally, a qualified ownership change occurs if more than 25% of the share capital or the voting rights are directly or indirectly
	transferred to a shareholder or a group of shareholders within a period of five years. A qualified ownership change may also occur
	in case of an increase in capital leading to a respective change in the shareholding. In the case of such a qualified ownership
	change tax loss carry forwards, consisting of the NOLs in the same percentage as the ownership change, cannot be utilized. If the
	percentage of the ownership change exceeds 50%, tax loss carry forwards expire in full. To the extent that the tax loss carry forwards
	do not exceed hidden reserves taxable in Germany, they may be further utilized despite a qualified ownership change.

	a portion or the complete tax operating loss carry forwards before they can be utilized. As a result, if we earn net taxable income,
	our ability to use our pre-change NOL carry forwards to reduce German income tax may be subject to limitations, which could potentially

	The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,
	including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations for which legal principles remain
	unsolved. The standards which the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and its non-U.S. counterparts use to grant
	patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the
	subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. The laws of some non-U.S. countries
	do not protect proprietary information to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered
	significant problems and costs in protecting their proprietary information in these non-U.S. countries. Outside the United States,
	patent protection must be sought in individual jurisdictions, further adding to the cost and uncertainty of obtaining adequate
	patent protection outside of the United States. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether additional patents protecting our technology
	will issue in the United States or in non-U.S. jurisdictions, or whether any patents that do issue will have claims of adequate
	scope to provide competitive advantage. Moreover, we cannot predict whether third parties will be able to successfully obtain claims
	or the breadth of such claims. The allowance of broader claims may increase the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings,
	opposition proceedings, and/or reexamination proceedings, the risk of infringement litigation, and the vulnerability of the claims
	to challenge. On the other hand, the allowance of narrower claims does not eliminate the potential for adversarial proceedings,

	The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced
	a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various
	types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation
	is not always uniform or predictable. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or
	methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be
	able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear
	and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings,
	we may incur substantial costs and divert management&rsquo;s time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have
	a material adverse effect on us. If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a
	license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time
	consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain
	a license, develop or obtain non-infringing technology, fail to defend an infringement action successfully or have infringed patents
	declared invalid, we may incur substantial monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing our product candidates to
	market and be precluded from manufacturing or selling our product candidates.

	The cost of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even

	business. For example, our TandAb technology was developed under certain patents licensed exclusively to us by DKFZ under a 2001
	license agreement which was subsequently amended in 2006. Additionally, an antibody generated in the development of our TandAb
	candidates was developed using antibody phage display technologies licensed to us by Xoma. In each of these cases, the licensor
	retains their full ownership interest with respect to the licensed patent rights, and our rights to use the technologies associated
	with those patents and to employ the inventions claimed in the licensed patent rights are subject to the continuation of and our
	compliance with the terms of those licenses.

	We are a party to a number of agreements, including license
	agreements, through which we have gained rights to certain intellectual property that relate to our business and we expect to enter
	into additional such agreements in the future. Our existing agreements impose, and we expect that future agreements will impose,
	various diligence, commercialization, milestone payment, royalty, and other obligations on us. Certain of our licenses, including
	each of our licenses with DKFZ and Xoma, contain provisions that allow the licensor to terminate the license upon the occurrence
	of specific events or conditions. For example, our rights under each of the licenses described above are subject to our continued
	compliance with the terms of the licenses, certain diligence and development obligations, the payment of royalties, milestone payments
	and other fees, and certain disclosure and confidentiality obligations. If we are found to be in breach of any of our license agreements,
	in certain circumstances our licensors may take action against us, including by terminating the applicable license. Because of
	the complexity of our product candidates and the patents we have licensed, determining the scope of the licenses and related obligations
	may be difficult and could lead to disputes between us and the licensor. An unfavorable resolution of such a dispute could lead
	to an increase in the royalties payable pursuant to the license or a termination of the license. If any of our licensors were to
	terminate our license agreement with them, we may be prevented from the continued use of certain technologies, including our rights
	to the TandAb, Flexibody and antibody phage display technologies, in clinical trials or, if our products are approved for marketing,
	from using such technologies in the manufacturing of products that could be sold commercially. This could delay or prevent us from

	Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel

	The DCGC applies to all Dutch companies listed on a government-recognized
	stock exchange, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere, including Nasdaq. We do not comply with all the best practice provisions
	of the DCGC. For example, the DCGC states that all supervisory board members need to be independent (a term that is defined in
	the DCGC), with the exception of one. We have more than one supervisory director that is deemed not independent under the DCGC.

	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on
	discovering and developing highly targeted cancer immunotherapies. Our product candidates are being developed in the field of immuno-oncology,
	which represents an innovative approach to cancer treatment that seeks to harness the body&rsquo;s own immune defenses to fight
	tumor cells. The most potent cells of the human defense arsenal are types of white blood cells called Natural Killer cells, or
	NK-cells, and T-cells. Our proprietary, next-generation bispecific antibodies, which we call TandAbs because of their tandem antibody
	structure, are designed to direct and establish a bridge between either NK-cells or T-cells and cancer cells. Our TandAbs have
	the ability to bring NK-cells or T-cells into proximity and trigger a signal cascade that leads to the destruction of cancer cells.
	Due to their novel tetravalent architecture (which provides for four binding domains), our TandAbs bind to their targets with high
	affinity and have half-lives that allow regular intravenous administration. We believe, based on their mechanism of action and
	the preclinical and clinical data we have generated to date, that our product candidates, alone or in combination, may ultimately
	improve response rates, clinical outcomes and survival in cancer patients and could eventually become a cornerstone of modern targeted
	oncology care.

	We have focused our research and development efforts on five
	proprietary programs for which we retain global commercial rights. Because our TandAbs bind with receptors that are known to be
	present on a number of types of cancer cells, each of our TandAb product candidates could be developed for the treatment of several
	different cancers. We intend to initially develop our two clinical stage product candidates in orphan or high-medical need indications,
	including as a salvage therapy for patients who have relapsed after, or are refractory to, that is who do not respond to treatment
	with, standard therapies, which we refer to as relapsed/refractory. These patients have a limited life expectancy and few therapeutic
	options. We believe this strategy will allow for a faster path to approval and will likely require smaller clinical trials compared
	to indications with more therapeutic options and larger patient populations. We believe such specialized market segments in oncology
	can be effectively targeted with a small and dedicated marketing and sales team. We currently intend to establish a commercial
	sales force in the United States and/or Europe to commercialize our product candidates when and if they are approved. We are also

	Our product development strategy initially targets relapsed or refractory cancer patients who have limited therapeutic alternatives,
	which we believe will enable us to utilize an expedited regulatory approval process. In the second quarter of 2015, a phase 2a
	proof of concept trial of AFM13 as a monotherapy was initiated by the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) in HL patients that have
	received all standard therapies and have relapsed after or are refractory to Adcetris. We expect interim data in the second quarter
	of 2016 and primary endpoint data by the end of 2016. We are also supporting an investigator-sponsored phase 1b/2a clinical trial
	of AFM13 in patients with CD30+ lymphoma conducted by Columbia University for which Columbia submitted
	an IND to the FDA that has since become effective. In addition, we have expanded our development strategy to combination therapies. We plan to initiate a phase 1b clinical
	trial to investigate AFM13 in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA&reg;) in HL patients that have relapsed after or are refractory
	to chemotherapy and Adcetris in the first half of 2016. For AFM11, we have begun a phase 1 dose escalation study designed to evaluate
	safety and tolerability and to potentially assess anti-tumor activity after four weeks of therapy in NHL patients. The phase 1
	clinical trial is ongoing and recruiting with a modified dose regimen. The amended study protocol was approved by the applicable
	regulatory authorities in the third quarter of 2015. We expect to report first data from this phase 1 trial by the end of 2016.

	Our Lead Product Candidate, AFM13, is a First-in-Class NK-Cell Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy
</I>
</B>
	. AFM13 is a targeted
	immunotherapy that is currently in development for HL as a salvage therapy. To engage and activate NK-cells, we have engineered
	AFM13 with a unique binding specificity for CD16A. AFM13 binds to CD16A with approximately 1,000-fold higher affinity than native
	antibody molecules via the constant region. While native antibodies bind to CD16A and CD16B with similar affinity, AFM13 does not
	bind to CD16B at all. CD16B is expressed on the surface of neutrophils, which show very limited anti-tumor activity and exist in
	such large amounts that little would be left for NK-cell binding and tumor cell killing were AFM13 not to be so selective for only
	CD16A. We believe that AFM13 is the only antibody in development that can specifically engage CD16A+ cells, in particular NK-cells,
	with very high affinity. In the second quarter of 2015, a phase 2a proof of concept trial of AFM13 was initiated by the German
	Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) in HL patients that have received all standard therapies and have relapsed after or are refractory to
	Adcetris. We expect interim data in the second quarter of 2016 and primary endpoint data by the end of 2016. The Leukemia and Lymphoma
	Society, or LLS, has agreed to co-fund this phase 2a HL study, a further indication of the promise this development candidate holds.
	We are also supporting an investigator-sponsored phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AFM13 in patients with CD30+ lymphoma conducted
	by Columbia University for which Columbia submitted an IND to the FDA that has since become effective. In order to prepare for further clinical
	development, we have conducted preclinical studies investigating the combination of AFM13 with CPIs and checkpoint agonists, or
	CPAs (collaboration with Stanford University). Based on data from these studies, we plan to initiate a phase 1b clinical trial
	in collaboration with Merck to investigate AFM13 in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA&reg;) in HL patients that have relapsed
	after or are refractory to chemotherapy and Adcetris. We will be the sole sponsor of this trial, which we expect to initiate in
	the first half of 2016. A preclinical investigation of the combination of AFM13 with lenalidomide (collaboration with Mayo Clinic)
	is still ongoing.

	Growing Pipeline of Product Candidates Focused on Key Cancer Indications.
</I>
</B>
	By leveraging our technology platform,
	we have built a growing pipeline of additional product candidates. Our second product candidate, AFM11, has demonstrated in preclinical
	studies highly specific and effective engagement of T-cells, inducing rapid and potent in vitro and in vivo tumor cell killing.
	AFM11 is expected to not require continuous infusion due to its half-life and has shown 100-fold higher affinity to CD3 compared
	to a reference molecule with the same sequence as Amgen&rsquo;s Blincyto (blinatumomab) and we believe it may have an efficacy
	advantage, especially in immunocompromised patients. We have begun a phase 1 dose ranging study of AFM11 designed to evaluate safety
	and tolerability and to potentially assess anti-tumor activity after four weeks of therapy in NHL patients. The phase 1 clinical
	trial is ongoing and recruiting with a modified dose regimen. The amended study protocol was approved by the applicable regulatory
	authorities in the third quarter of 2015. We believe that the new, less frequent dosing regimen provides a better opportunity to investigate potential
	benefits of AFM11 related to the molecular characteristics of TandAbs, i.e. the longer half-life and the higher affinity to T-cells
	compared to BiTEs. We expect to report first data from this phase 1 trial by the end of 2016. In addition, we are planning to investigate
	AFM11 in ALL patients and are preparing a phase 1 dose ranging study that is expected to begin recruitment in the first half of
	2016. Our third product candidate, AFM21 (EGFRvIII / CD3), which is in preclinical development, addresses a target that to date
	has been elusive and that is abundant in certain solid tumors, including glioblastoma, prostate cancer and head and neck cancer,
	but not found on healthy tissue. In preclinical studies, AFM21 has demonstrated an ability to selectively kill EGFRvIII-carrying
	cells and not wild-type EGFR. In addition to the AFM21, which targets EGFRvIII on tumor cells and CD3 on T-cells, we further advanced
	an EGFRvIII/CD16A NK-cell TandAb, called AFM22. An additional CD16A NK-cell TandAb, called AFM24 targeting EGFR-wild type, a validated
	solid tumor target has been engineered and characterized preclinically. Based on data from ongoing experiments, we will decide
	which program to advance into IND-enabling studies.

	We are initially developing AFM13 for HL in the salvage setting

	by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in August 2011 as a salvage therapy for HL. Approximately half of the patients
	treated with Adcetris experience disease progression in less than half a year after initiation of therapy. In a recent phase 1
	dose-escalation clinical trial, AFM13 was well-tolerated and demonstrated tumor shrinkage or slowing of tumor growth, with disease
	control shown in 16 of 26 patients eligible for efficacy evaluation. AFM13 also stopped tumor growth in patients who are refractory
	to Adcetris. Six out of seven patients who became refractory to Adcetris as the immediate prior therapy experienced stabilization
	of disease under AFM13 treatment according Cheson&rsquo;s criteria, standard criteria for assessing treatment response in lymphoma.
	We believe that based on its novel mode of action, AFM13 may be beneficial to patients who have relapsed or are refractory to treatment

	Our second clinical stage candidate, AFM11, is a T-cell
	TandAb designed for the treatment of certain CD19+ B-cell malignancies, including non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, or NHL, Acute
	Lymphocytic Leukemia, or ALL, and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, or CLL. AFM11 binds selectively with CD19, a clinically
	validated target in B-cell malignancies. It also binds to CD3, a component of the T-cell receptor complex, triggering a
	signal cascade that leads to the destruction of tumor cells that carry CD19. Based on its molecular characteristics, in
	particular its molecular weight, we expect AFM11 will have a longer half-life than blinatumomab, a bispecific antibody also
	targeted against CD19 and CD3 developed by Amgen, and approved in the United States and Europe. This should allow
	administration through bolus intravenous infusion, rather than continuous infusion, which requires hospitalization or a
	portable pump over one or more cycles of four-weeks each with frequent reconstitution and refill of medication, as is
	necessary for blinatumomab. In preclinical studies, AFM11 compared to the blinatumomab reference compound also showed a
	100-fold higher affinity to the CD3 receptor, resulting in up to 40-fold greater cytotoxic potency at low T-cell counts. We
	have begun a phase 1 dose ranging study of AFM11 designed to evaluate safety and tolerability and to potentially assess
	anti-tumor activity after four weeks of therapy in NHL patients. The phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing and recruiting with a
	modified dose regimen. The amended study protocol was approved by the applicable regulatory authorities in the third quarter
	of 2015. We believe that the new, less frequent dosing regimen provides a better opportunity to investigate potential
	benefits of AFM11 related to the molecular characteristics of TandAbs, i.e. the longer half-life compared to BiTEs and higher
	affinity to T-cells. We expect to report first data from this phase 1 trial by the end of 2016. In addition, we are planning
	to investigate AFM11 in ALL patients and are preparing a phase 1 dose ranging study that is expected to be initiated in the
	first half of 2016.

	Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which cells divide and
	grow in an uncontrolled fashion, forming malignancies that can invade other parts of the body. In normal tissues, the rates of
	new cell growth and cell death are tightly regulated and kept in balance. In cancerous tissues, this balance is disrupted as a
	result of mutations, causing unregulated cell growth that leads to tumor formation. While tumors can grow slowly or rapidly, the
	dividing cells will nevertheless accumulate and the normal organization of the tissue will become disrupted. Cancers subsequently
	can spread throughout the body by processes known as invasion and metastasis. Once cancer spreads to sites beyond the primary tumor,
	it may be incurable. Cancer cells that arise in the lymphatic system and bone marrow are referred to as hematological malignancies.
	Cancer cells that arise in other tissues or organs are referred to as solid tumors.

	The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are
	surgery, radiation and drug therapy. For patients with localized disease, surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective.
	Drug therapies are generally used by physicians in patients who have cancer that has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise
	be treated through surgery, such as most hematological malignancies. The goal of drug therapies is to damage and kill cancer cells
	or to interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the development, growth and survival of cancer cells. In
	many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug
	therapy has evolved from non-specific drugs that kill both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular

	An early approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to
	develop drugs, referred to as chemotherapies or cytotoxic drugs, which kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells through non-specific
	mechanisms, such as disrupting cell metabolism or causing damage to cellular components required for tumor survival and rapid growth.
	While these drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, cytotoxic drug therapies act in an indiscriminate manner,
	killing healthy cells along with cancerous cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow therapeutic
	window, or dose range above which the toxicity causes unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage and below which the drugs are
	not effective in eradicating cancer cells.

	The next approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to

	spread of cancer. Included in this category are small molecule drugs as well as large molecule drugs, also known as biologics.
	With heightened vigilance and new diagnostic tests, targeted therapies (including monoclonal antibodies such as Herceptin&reg;,

	Cancer immunotherapy plays an increasing role among emerging

	co-stimulatory signals of the immune system, T-cell and NK-cell engagers, for example, bispecific antibodies, or cellular therapies
	involving transforming a patient&rsquo;s own T-cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Ipilimumab (Yervoy&reg;), sipuleucel-T

	Native, or naturally occurring, antibodies are Y-shaped proteins
	that are used by the immune system to target pathogens. Antibodies are comprised of two identical heavy chains and two identical
	light chains. The binding sites for target molecules are formed by the two variable domains of the heavy and light chains at the
	tips of the two arms, also referred to as Fv regions. The two Fv regions target the same antigen, and this bivalent binding to
	a receptor on the surface of a cell leads to an increase in binding strength. The Fc region can bind, recruit and activate immune
	system cells, including NK-cells, but not T-cells, to amplify the immune response to antigen bound by the Fv regions.

	Our TandAbs consist of four FV domain fragments derived from
	two different parent antibodies. Two FV fragments bind specifically to a disease target, such as CD30 on a tumor cell, and the
	other two FV regions bind specifically to receptors of an immune cell, such as an NK-cell. In this way, our TandAbs are designed
	to bind with specificity to two different cells, a target cell and an effector cell. The FV domain fragments are connected by short
	peptide linkers. TandAbs are expressed from a single gene construct, and two chains of the resulting polypeptides assemble spontaneously
	in an intermolecular fashion to form the biologically active structure (a homodimer). Like the parent antibodies, a TandAb has
	two binding sites for each target: two domains bind to a receptor on an NK-cell or T-cell, and two bind to a receptor on tumor
	cells.

	Among a large group of lymphomas, at least 80% belong to the
	NHL group. These cancers can originate from either malignant B-cells or T-cells, whereby B-cell derived NHL comprises the vast
	majority. NHL includes precursor B-cell tumors and 12 distinctly-defined mature B-cell tumors, among them DLBCL, follicular lymphoma,
	or FL, and mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL. The latter three subtypes are the focus of the clinical development of AFM11. The total

	70,000 are in the United States. DLBCL alone represents about 46,000 new patients in North America, the European Union and Japan

	There is a high medical need for new treatment options in NHL,
	both in the first line setting and in the relapsed/refractory setting. Standard first line treatment of patients with NHL consists
	of the CHOP chemotherapy regimen. The regimen is usually combined with rituximab (an anti CD20 antibody). While this regimen results
	in a durable response for the majority of patients with aggressive disease, in patients with indolent, or slowly progressing, disease,
	the chemotherapy is less effective. The effect of treatments in relapsed/refractory NHL also depends on the type of disease. For
	instance, response rates achieved with new targeted therapies in follicular lymphoma (FL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are at
	least partially promising and ibrutinib (Impruvica&reg;) was approved in the United States for MCL in 2013 based on phase 2 data
	showing a response rate of 66%. However, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the largest group within NHL, data are less
	promising with response rates usually not exceeding 30%. Promising results for this patient population were seen with blinatumomab,
	a bispecific antibody with the same disease target and immune cell target as AFM11 (CD19/CD3). Preliminary data of a phase 2 study
	in relapsed/refractory NHL patients (n=21) showed a response rate of 42%. In addition, the first data from a phase 1 trial investigating
	a CD19-targeting CAR T-cell therapy in NHL showed a response rate of almost 80% (11 out of 14 patients).

	ALL, an aggressive type of leukemia characterized by an overproduction
	of lymphocytes in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood, is also primarily a B-cell disease and exhibits the CD19 receptor.
	According to the National Cancer Institute, in 2013 an estimated number of 6,000 ALL cases were newly diagnosed in the United States,
	more than half in children and adolescents. Treatment of patients with ALL usually consists of a regimen that includes vincristine,
	prednisone, and an anthracycline, with or without asparaginase, and results in a complete response rate of up to 80% in patients
	aged 1-18 years; for adults, complete response rates are considerably lower (about 30% for patients above 40 years of age). Recently,
	Blincyto (blinatumomab) has been approved in the United States and in the EU for Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory
	B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This product is a bifunctional molecule similar to AFM11 in its targeting
	features and has demonstrated a high response rate in the labelled adult population.

	CLL, the most common type of leukemia in adults, exhibits the
	CD19 receptor as well. Malignant B-cells accumulate in the bone marrow and blood, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. In
	the United States about 16,000 new CLL cases are expected to be diagnosed and about 4,600 patients are expected to die from CLL
	annually.

	Current treatment options for solid tumors consist of a mix
	of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies. While historically chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimens were standard,
	now tumor specific biomarkers are considered more frequently in order to make a decision for optimal treatment of the individual
	patient. This opportunity was primarily driven by the development of innovative targeted therapies, in particular monoclonal antibodies
	and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. For example, prior to the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the tumor is investigated for
	histology (adenocarcinoma vs. non-adenocarcinoma), K-RAS mutation, EGFR mutations, EML4-ALK mutation, BRAF expression, HER2 expression
	and others. A treatment decision is then made based on biomarkers in order to tailor treatment to the patient. In general, the
	treatment of solid tumors shows a clear trend towards an individualized treatment, also known as personalized medicine.

	Monoclonal antibodies play an important role in the treatment
	of solid tumors. Herceptin, Erbitux and Avastin were first approved about 10 years ago and are now well established in the treatment
	of many different cancer entities. Erbitux is considered standard in the treatment of head and neck cancers, Herceptin for the
	treatment of breast cancer and Avastin has shown efficacy in patients with prostate, ovarian and lung cancer. Hormonal therapy
	plays a role in certain tumors the growth of which is triggered by hormones: breast cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer.
	In addition, immunotherapies play an increasing role. The first immunotherapies became standard treatments about 5 years ago: the
	vaccine Provenge (Sipuleucel -T) in prostate cancer and the checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab (anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody) in
	melanoma. The PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors nivololumab and pembrolizumab have been approved more recently for the treatment of melanoma,
	lung cancer. Many trials with cancer immunotherapies are ongoing. It is expected that imunotherapies will play an increasing role
	in the standard therapy of solid tumors. While considerable progress was made over the last decade in the treatment of solid tumors,
	there are some cancer types for which new treatments have not provided survival benefit for patients, one of which is glioblastoma.
	Overall, cure is still the exception for the majority of late stage tumors, in particular metastatic tumors, and the medical need
	for new and safe treatment approaches remains generally high for solid tumors.

	The focus for the development of our EGFRvIII TandAb will initially

	According to the National Cancer Institute, 22,900 patients are newly diagnosed with brain tumors per year in the United States,
	and about 15% of them suffer from glioblastoma. These patients are usually treated with a combined approach of surgery, radiotherapy
	and chemotherapy with temozolomide playing a central role. Although many new treatment approaches have been investigated over the

	The clinical and preclinical data that we have accumulated to
	date suggest that AFM13 appears to be well differentiated from Adcetris, the first approved targeted therapy for HL patients that
	are relapsed/refractory to second line treatments. Although AFM13 employs the same disease target as Adcetris (CD30), the two compounds
	are fundamentally different in their mechanism of action: Adcetris is a targeted chemotherapy, while AFM13 is a targeted immunotherapy.
	Adcetris delivers a toxin (monomethyl auristatin E) to the cells that carry the CD30 receptor, and the cell is killed by the action
	of the toxin after its internalization and release from the antibody. In contrast, AFM13 does not need to enter the cell, but serves
	as a connector on the cell surface between the CD30 receptor and an NK cell. Once the cells are in contact, the killing activity
	of the NK-cell is triggered.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
	Tumor cells have the ability to activate a multi-drug resistance
	system, or MDR, which we believe may contribute to the development of resistance to Adcetris. The MDR, however, does not affect
	the efficacy of an immunotherapy like AFM13. We believe that this difference may not only translate into efficacy of AFM13 in patients
	relapsing from Adcetris therapy, but ultimately into a longer clinical benefit. In addition, the off-target toxicity of Adcetris&rsquo;
	toxin monomethyl auristatin E causes severe neutropenia (low neutrophils) and neuropathy (damage to the peripheral nervous system).
	We believe AFM13 may avoid these side effects because it does not introduce a toxin such as monomethyl auristatin E into the cells.
	Hence, AFM13 may address Adcetris&rsquo; safety limitation, and because of the immunological approach, AFM13 may also address the
	short duration of response of Adcetris.

	We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial of AFM13, AFM13-101, in
	patients with HL from September 2010 to April 2013. All patients in this trial suffered from heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory
	disease and had documented progression of disease at study entry. The objectives of the trial were: to determine the safety and
	tolerability of increasing doses of single cycles of AFM13 as a monotherapy; to determine the maximum tolerated dose and optimal
	biological dose of AFM13; to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AFM13; to analyze immunological markers, NK-cell activity,
	NK-cell markers, serum outcome markers and cytokine release; to assess the immunogenicity, or ability to provoke an immune response,
	of AFM13; and to assess the activity of AFM13. The phase 1 trial was conducted in Germany and the United States. We submitted a

	The trial enrolled 28 patients (16 males, 12 females) in eight

	on a weekly dosing schedule for four weeks. In addition, four patients were treated with 4.5 mg/kg twice weekly for four weeks.
	Of the 28 patients, 14 had refractory disease and the remainder had relapsed disease. The patients had received a median of six

	The clinical results were first presented to the medical community
	by Professor Andreas Engert, University Hospital of Cologne, the lead investigator for the study, at the Lugano International Meeting
	on Malignant Lymphoma in 2013. AFM13 showed an acceptable safety profile. An independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, was
	responsible for the review of safety data on an ongoing basis. It was concluded that the maximum feasible single dose of 7 mg/kg
	was reached without any toxicity concerns, and consequently the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The four patients who were
	treated with 4.5 mg/kg twice weekly completed treatment without raising any toxicity concerns for the IDMC. The most common adverse
	events were fever and chills, and in general, they were of mild to moderate severity. Overall, less than 30% of all adverse events

	Twenty-six of 28 patients were eligible for efficacy evaluation.
	For the remaining two patients, efficacy assessments have not been performed. Of the 26 patients, three had a partial remission,
	13 had stable disease and 10 had disease progression as best overall response. With the exception of the 0.04 mg/kg dose cohort,
	anti-tumor activity was observed at all dose levels tested but was more pronounced at or above 1.5 mg/kg. In this subgroup (n=13),
	3 partial responses (=50% tumor shrinkage) and 7 cases with stable disease were observed, with an overall response rate of 23%
	(3/13) and a disease control rate of 77%. The chart below shows for these 13 individual patients the best overall response measured

	In the second quarter of 2015, a phase 2a proof of concept trial
	of AFM13 was initiated by the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) in HL patients that have received all standard therapies and have
	relapsed after or are refractory to Adcetris. The primary endpoint is tumor response. We have designed the trial to demonstrate
	a response rate of greater than 30% for the selected dose as clinical experts consider a response rate of greater than 30% and
	a progression free survival time of greater than six months to be clinically meaningful for this patient population. Duration of
	response and progression free survival are secondary endpoints as we believe these time parameters, which indicate durability of
	efficacy, may differentiate AFM13 from Adcetris. We expect interim data in the second quarter of 2016 and primary endpoint data
	by the end of 2016. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, or LLS, has agreed to co-fund this phase 2a HL study, a further indication
	of the promise this development candidate holds.

	We believe that the phase 2b trial could support an application
	for registration in relapsed/refractory HL. This belief is based on the fact that AFM13 is being developed for an indication with
	high medical need because currently no other established treatment options are available for the targeted patient population. At
	the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in December 2014, the first clinical data with two PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors,
	nivolumab and pembrolizumab, in refractory HL patients was published. The patient population was similar to the one included in
	the AFM13 phase 2a study. These early data showed high response rates, giving rise to breakthrough designation for nivolumab. We
	plan to refine our regulatory strategy as we generate additional clinical data for HL.

	Competent authorities, including the FDA, have regulations in

	of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, summarized the intention of the FDA to help patients by streamlining
	drug approval procedures under certain circumstances. There are also numerous precedents for such approval strategies. For example,
	Adcetris received accelerated approval in 2011 based on data from an open label phase 2 study in 102 patients with relapsed/refractory
	HL. In addition, the FDA in 2014 approved Blincyto (blinatumomab) under breakthrough designation and accelerated review after only

	Based on its safety profile, AFM13 is suitable not only for
	monotherapy, but also as combination therapy.We are continuing to perform preclinical studies investigating the combination of
	AFM13 with CPIs and checkpoint agonists, or CPAs (collaboration with Stanford University), and lenalidomide (collaboration with
	Mayo Clinic). We believe that AFM13 and immunomodulators administered together could lead to greater tumor cell killing because
	these molecules may have a synergistic anti-tumor effect involving both NK-cells and T-cells. In preclinical animal studies of
	HL using both patient derived xenograft (PDX) and immune cells from blood (PBMCs), the established tumor was treated with AFM13
	and CPIs/CPAs (anti-PD-1, anti-CD137 and anti-CTLA4) both alone and in combination. While the single agent treatment showed a significant
	reduction in tumor growth for most molecules when compared to the control treatment group (irrelevant IgG), all combinations of
	AFM13 and CPI/CPA showed enhanced anti-tumor efficacy [see graph]. We also analyzed the change in intra-tumoral lymphocyte population
	compared to IgG treatment. It was observed that in all AFM13-treated animals (as a single agent and in all combinations), the NK-cell
	population in the tumor increased. In addition, while there was no increase of T-cells in animals treated with only AFM13 or CPIs/CPAs,
	there was an increase of cytotoxic T-cells detected in animals treated with AFM13 in combination with a CPI/CPA. These results
	provide the rationale for the investigation of combinations with AFM13 in the clinical setting, initially focusing on PD-1. Final
	data on the combination with CPIs/CPAs were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in 2015.
	Based on the preclinical data, we are planning to initiate a clinical phase 1b study investigating the combination of AFM13 with
	Merck&rsquo;s anti PD-1 antibody KEYTRUDA

	The most promising clinical data for patients with relapsed/refractory
	B-cell malignancies is with Blincyto (blinatumomab), a bispecific antibody with the same disease target and immune cell target
	as AFM11 (CD19/CD3). Blincyto has meanwhile been approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory
	B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The response rates observed with this molecule in clinical trials with patients
	with ALL are higher than those obtained with other experimental and approved treatments used currently in the salvage setting.
	Moreover, in ALL trials the complete responses were all molecular responses, that is CD19+ cells were completely ablated such that
	none were detectable with the most sensitive techniques available. Molecular response means absence of minimal residual disease,
	which is a predictor of long-term outcome, and hence this therapy may translate into extended progression-free survival and also
	overall survival.

	The preclinical data that we have accumulated to date suggest
	that AFM11 appears to be well differentiated from blinatumomab. AFM11 has a molecular mass of 104kD, which should allow intravenous
	administration over one to four hours rather than continuous infusion, which is necessary for blinatumomab and requires initial
	hospitalization for monitoring followed by an at-home portable pump over a period of up to eight weeks. In preclinical studies
	comparing AFM11 to a reference molecule made with the same sequence as blinatumomab, AFM11 showed a 100-fold higher affinity to
	the CD3 receptor, resulting in greater cytotoxic potency. Unlike the reference compound for blinatumomab, for which cytotoxic potency
	decreases at lower effector cell to tumor cell ratios, AFM11&rsquo;s cytotoxic potency remains constant. Specifically, when tumor
	cells are 5x the number of T-cells (effector cell to tumor cell or E:T = 0.2), AFM11&rsquo;s potency is 40-fold higher than that
	of blinatumomab (figure below, left). In another experiment, AFM11 led to more complete tumor cell lysis (death) at low T-cell
	counts when compared to a blinatumomab reference compound (figure below, right). These findings may be of clinical importance because
	patients that have been treated with chemotherapy suffer from lymphopenia with a significant reduction in absolute T-cell numbers.
	These findings could theoretically also be of significance in tumor masses, which are poorly vascularized and to which T-cells
	have limited access.

	with Janssen that gives Janssen the option to acquire Amphivena upon predetermined terms following acceptance by the FDA of an
	IND filing for the product candidate. Affimed has successfully reached its first three milestones, up to the generation and acceptance
	of a CD33xCD3 development candidate TandAb meeting certain target features. The third milestone was reached in the first quarter
	of 2015. Following the achievement of the third milestone of the Amphivena collaboration we were eligible to receive a milestone
	payment of &euro;7.5 million payable in three installments. The first installment of &euro;1.3 million was paid in the first quarter
	of 2015, and the second installment of &euro;4.2 million was paid in October 2015.

	Amphivena has separately entered into a warrant agreement with

	upon predetermined terms, in exchange for payments under the warrant. Janssen is obligated to make payments to Amphivena under
	the warrant upon Amphivena&rsquo;s achievement of specified milestones under the license and development agreement described below.
	Amphivena must use commercially reasonable efforts to research and develop the product candidate and carry out the corresponding
	development program. Affimed has successfully reached its first three milestones, including the selection and acceptance of a development
	candidate meeting the pre-specified criteria. In the event Amphivena fails to conduct any material development activity for a specified
	period or other important events defined in the warrant agreement that would prevent Amphivena from continuing the development
	program, among other rights, Janssen has the option to purchase Amphivena and/or to exercise an exclusive license under certain
	intellectual property controlled by Amphivena. In this situation, Janssen must still make certain reduced milestone payments ranging
	from low single digits to the low teen millions. Such payments will be made to Amphivena if Janssen elects to purchase Amphivena,
	or to us if Janssen exercises the right to license that certain intellectual property, as discussed above. The warrant agreement
	may be terminated at any time by mutual consent of Amphivena and Janssen and automatically terminates upon Janssen&rsquo;s failure
	to exercise the warrant once the exercise option is triggered, or to make payments required under the agreement. Janssen also may
	unilaterally terminate the warrant agreement upon specified events causing safety concerns, if the equity investors do not meet
	their funding obligations to Amphivena, or at any time provided that all milestone payments have been paid (regardless of whether
	such payments have become due).

	. In 2013, we entered into a research funding
	agreement with The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, or LLS, for the clinical development of AFM13. Pursuant to the research funding
	agreement, LLS agreed to co-fund the clinical phase 2a development of AFM13 and to contribute up to approximately $4.4 million
	(&euro;4.0 million) over two years to support the project. We have agreed to match LLS&rsquo;s contributions toward the project
	budget. Our receipt of the $4.4 million total that LLS has agreed to contribute is conditioned on the achievement of certain milestones
	in connection with the development of AFM13, four of which have been met. As a result, we have already received $3.3 million in
	funds from LLS. We must use the funding provided by LLS exclusively with the development program, and return any excess funding
	to LLS. We are solely responsible for and have control over all development work and are obligated to use commercially reasonable
	efforts, as defined in the research funding agreement, in our conduct of the development program to achieve the specified milestones.
	We also have retained exclusive commercialization and distribution rights to AFM13. The research funding agreement was amended
	in April 2014 to amend the projected milestone event dates and modify certain aspects of the agreement regarding the phase 2a study
	design.

	Overview.
</I>
	In June 2006, we amended a 2001 license agreement
	with Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, or DKFZ. Under the agreement, as amended, we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing
	license under specified DKFZ patent rights to make, have made, use, sell and have sold licensed products and to practice licensed
	commercial services, which specifically excludes services that are paid for with government grant funding. We have developed our
	TandAb technology under the licensed patent rights. In connection with the agreement, as amended, we issued DKFZ 350 shares of
	our Series C preferred shares, which were subsequently converted into Series D preferred shares in the equivalent amount of &euro;50,000
	and made a &euro;35,000 cash payment to DKFZ. We are also required to pay DKFZ a low single digit royalty on net sales, as defined
	in the agreement, of licensed products and services and a mid-single digit percentage of income we receive in connection with granting
	a third party a sublicense of our rights under the license agreement. If we grant a sublicense in connection with entering into
	a cross-licensing arrangement with one or more third parties, we are obligated to make a lump-sum payment of DM 70,000 (&euro;35,790)
	to DKFZ following the execution of each such sublicense. We are obligated to make the above royalty payments to DKFZ during the
	term of the licensed patents and for the two years following the expiration of the licensed patents.

	Overview and research license granted to us
</I>
	. In September
	2006, we entered into a license agreement with Xoma Ireland Limited, or XOMA. Pursuant to the agreement, XOMA granted us a worldwide,
	fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to conduct research on immunoglobulins under certain patent
	rights and know-how owned or otherwise controlled by XOMA. We refer to this research-only license grant as the &ldquo;research
	license.&rdquo; The research license grants us the right to identify, select, isolate, purify, characterize, study and/or test
	immunoglobulins using XOMA&rsquo;s antibody phage display technologies.

<I>
	Options to license granted to us
</I>
	. XOMA also granted us
	options, exercisable on an immunoglobulin-by-immunoglobulin basis, to obtain certain additional manufacturing or commercialization
	rights, including an option to obtain a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license under the licensed XOMA patent rights
	and know-how to make or have made (in a prokaryote and without use of a dicistronic construct), use, sell, offer to sell, import
	and otherwise commercialize immunoglobulins discovered, isolated or optimized under the research license for the diagnosis, treatment,
	prevention or prophylaxis of any human condition or disease. Unless XOMA grants us such a license, we are prohibited from commercializing,
	licensing or developing any immunoglobulin discovered, isolated or optimized under the research license. XOMA is not required to
	grant us a license upon our exercise of the option, unless the other provisions of the license agreement are complied with, including
	the requirement that we provide XOMA a specified form of prior written notice detailing the immunoglobulin with respect to which
	we wish to obtain a license. In addition, XOMA is not required to grant us such a license if the relevant immunoglobulin is already
	the subject of an exclusive license granted by XOMA to a third party or if XOMA can provide evidence of a bona fide development
	program for any immunoglobulin that binds to the same target as the immunoglobulin that is the subject of our request for a license
	pursuant to the option. For each immunoglobulin for which we obtain such a commercialization license pursuant to our exercise of
	the option, we are obligated to make milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain clinical and regulatory events. For each
	immunoglobulin, if all milestone events under the commercialization license are achieved, the aggregate milestone payments could
	total $350,000. In addition, we are obligated to pay XOMA a low single digit percentage royalty on net sales on a country-by-country
	and immunoglobulin-by-immunoglobulin basis, until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim in the relevant
	country or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the corresponding product.

	The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved

	years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions
	are available in other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, or to offer similar protection

	Recently, phase 1 clinical data with the anti PD-1 checkpoint
	inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab in HL was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and at ASH, respectively. These
	early data indicate the potential of anti PD-1 antibodies to cause high response rates in the salvage setting of HL. The FDA has

	and pembrolizumab (registrational intent). Since we are preparing a clinical study of AFM13 in combination with pembrolizumab in

	The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether

	to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed
	to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologics are reviewed within ten
	months from the date the application is accepted for filing. Although the FDA often meets its user fee performance goals, it can
	extend these timelines if necessary, and its review may not occur on a timely basis at all. The FDA usually refers applications
	for novel biologics, or biologics which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee&mdash;typically
	a panel that includes clinicians and other experts&mdash;for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application
	should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
	Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally,
	the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product
	unless it verifies that compliance with cGMP standards is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence

	If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&rsquo;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will
	issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information

	Biosimilars are biological products which are &ldquo;highly similar&rdquo; to a previously approved biologic product or &ldquo;reference
	product&rdquo; and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product

	for products administered multiple times, the biosimilar and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously
	administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
	However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes
	by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation which are still being worked out by the FDA.

	Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing
	post-approval regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics,
	including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and
	educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in
	significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards,
	a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and federal and state civil and criminal
	investigations and prosecutions.

	Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications

	new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical
	data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements

	Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are
	required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as phase 4 testing, REMS, and
	surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict
	the distribution or use of the product. In addition, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must
	continue to conform to current cGMPs after approval. Biologics manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to
	register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic
	unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs.
	Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain
	compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls, or impose marketing restrictions
	through labeling changes or product removals if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems
	following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation
	to biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition&mdash;generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000
	individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan
	drug designation, the generic identity of the biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug
	designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
	The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular product to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation
	is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year
	exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited
	circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does
	not prevent the FDA from approving a different biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same biologic for a different
	disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of
	the BLA application user fee.

	Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, which came into force on January
	26, 2007, aims to facilitate the development and accessibility of medical products for use in children without subjecting children
	to unnecessary trials, or delaying the authorization of medicinal products for use in adults. The regulation established the Paediatric
	Committee, or PDCO, which is responsible for coordinating the EMA&rsquo;s activities regarding medicines for children. The PDCO&rsquo;s
	main role is to determine all the studies that marketing authorization applicants need to do in the pediatric population as part
	of the so-called Paediatric Investigation Plans, or PIPs. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines that were
	not authorized in the European Union before January 26, 2007 have to include either the results of studies carried out in children
	of different ages (as agreed with the PDCO), or proof that a waiver or a deferral of these studies has been obtained from the PDCO.
	As indicated, the PDCO determines what pediatric studies are necessary and describes them in a PIP. This requirement for pediatric
	studies also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine
	that is already authorized. The PDCO can grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine
	in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults and can also grant waivers
	when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly
	population.

	Certain drugs, including medicinal products developed by means

	application under the centralized authorization procedure results in a marketing authorization from the European Commission, which

	are also obligated to recognize the Commission decision. The EMA and the European Commission administer the centralized authorization

	Under the centralized authorization procedure, the CHMP serves
	as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of human products on behalf of the EMA.
	The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state&rsquo;s national drug authority, with one of them appointed to act
	as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the Committee acting
	as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP is required
	to issue an opinion within 210 days of receipt of a valid application, though the clock is stopped if it is necessary to ask the
	applicant for clarification or further supporting data. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory
	authorities of member states and a number of experts. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report, or
	EPAR, is produced. If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product is sufficiently proven,
	it adopts a positive opinion. The CHMP&rsquo;s opinion is sent to the European Commission, which uses the opinion as the basis
	for its decision whether or not to grant a marketing authorization. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the
	grounds on which this conclusion was reached.

	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on
	discovering and developing highly targeted cancer immunotherapies. We develop our product candidates in the field of immuno-oncology,
	which represents an innovative approach to cancer treatment that seeks to harness the body&rsquo;s own immune defenses to fight
	tumor cells. The most potent cells of the human defense arsenal are types of white blood cells called natural killer cells, or
	NK-cells, and T-cells. Our proprietary, next-generation bispecific antibodies, called TandAbs because of their tandem antibody
	structure, are designed to direct and establish a bridge between either NK-cells or T-cells and cancer cells triggering a signal
	cascade that leads to the destruction of cancer cells. Due to their novel tetravalent architecture (which provides for four binding
	domains), our TandAbs bind to their targets with high affinity and have half-lives that allow regular, intravenous administration.
	We believe, based on their mechanism of action and the preclinical and clinical data we have generated to date, that our product
	candidates, alone or in combination, may ultimately improve response rates, clinical outcomes and survival in cancer patients and
	could eventually become a cornerstone of modern targeted oncology care.

	2015, we have raised an aggregate of &euro;171.2 million through the issuance of equity and incurrence of loans. To date, we have

	In the future, the timing of our revenue may vary significantly
	from the receipt of the related cash flows, as the revenue from some upfront or initiation payments is deferred and recognized
	as revenue over the estimated service period, while other revenue is earned when received, such as milestone payments or service
	fees. Our revenue has varied substantially, especially due to the impact of Collaboration revenue received from Amphivena, and
	is expected to continue to vary, from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending upon, among other things, the structure and
	timing of milestone events, the number of milestones achieved, the level of revenues earned for ongoing development efforts, revenue
	from service contracts entered into by AbCheck, any new collaboration arrangements we may enter into and the terms we are able
	to negotiate with our partners. We therefore believe that period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as indicative
	of our future revenues.

	We expect that our general and administrative expenses in 2016
	will increase compared to the expenses in 2015 by roughly 25%, and will continue to increase in the future as our business expands.
	These public company-related increases will likely include costs of additional personnel, additional legal fees, accounting and
	audit fees, managing directors&rsquo; and supervisory directors&rsquo; liability insurance premiums and costs related to investor
	relations. In addition, we may grant share-based compensation awards to key management personnel and other employees.

	Research and development expenses increased 129% from &euro;9.6
	million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to &euro;22.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, mainly due to higher expenses
	for AFM13, other projects and infrastructure. For the year 2016, we anticipate significantly higher research and development expenses
	particularly from the expected start of additional clinical trials with AFM13 (phase 1b/2a trial of AFM13 in patients with CD30+
	lymphoma and phase 1b combination trial of AFM13 with Merck&rsquo;s anti PD-1 antibody KEYTRUDA

	in patients with

	In the year ended December 31, 2015, expenses increased significantly primarily

	Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses.

	On July 24, 2014, our subsidiary Affimed Therapeutics AG
	(now Affimed GmbH) entered into an agreement for a loan facility (the &ldquo;Perceptive Credit Facility&rdquo;) with an
	affiliate of Perceptive Advisors LLC. The Perceptive Credit Facility originally provided for aggregate funding of $14.0
	million, including $5.5 million in initial funding and up to an additional $8.5 million of capital available in subsequent
	tranches. In 2015, we agreed with Perceptive to cancel the option to draw the remaining available $8.5

	The loans outstanding under the Perceptive Credit
	Facility accrue interest at an annual rate equal to an applicable margin of nine percent plus one-month LIBOR, with LIBOR
	deemed to equal 1% if LIBOR is less than 1% and is payable in monthly installments of interest only through April 2016 and
	then principal and interest thereafter in monthly installments through August 2018, with the outstanding balance to be repaid
	in full at the end of August 2018. Borrowings under the Perceptive Credit Facility are secured by a substantial portion of
	our tangible assets and intellectual property. Under the loan agreement governing the facility, we are subject to customary
	affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness, limitations on liens, limitations on
	acquisitions and other restrictions related to our tangible assets and intellectual property. Additionally, covenants set
	forth under the facility will require us to maintain a minimum cash balance of $2.0 million. We have also agreed to achieve
	certain development milestones for AFM11 and AFM13. We have entered into a discussion regarding the facility with Perceptive,

	If we receive regulatory approval for AFM13, AFM11, AFM21/AFM22 or AFM24, and if we choose not to grant any licenses to partners,
	we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution,
	depending on where we choose to commercialize. We also expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
	Additional funds may not be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all, and such funds, if raised, may not be sufficient

	In conjunction with the closing of our initial public offering,
	we established the Affimed N.V. Equity Incentive Plan 2014 (&ldquo;the 2014 Plan&rdquo;) with the purpose of advancing the interests
	of our shareholders by enhancing our ability to attract, retain and motivate individuals who are expected to make important contributions
	to us. The maximum number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan equals 7% of the total outstanding common shares
	on September 17, 2014, or 1,678,891 common shares. On January 1 of any calendar year thereafter (including January 1, 2016), an
	additional 5% of the total outstanding common shares on that date becomes available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. The absolute
	number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan will increase automatically upon the issuance of additional shares
	by the Company. The option exercise price for options under the 2014 Plan is the fair market value of a share as defined in the
	2014 Plan on the relevant grant date. We are following home country rules relating to the re-pricing of stock options. Under applicable
	Dutch law, re-pricing is permissible, but constitutes a deviation from the best practice provisions of the DCGC. As a result, if
	we engage in re-pricing of stock options, we would be required to provide an explanation in our annual report for why we do not
	comply with the best practice provisions.

	The following discussion is a summary of the material German
	tax considerations which&mdash;as the Company has its place of management in Germany and is therefore tax resident in Germany&mdash;relate
	to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common shares both by a shareholder (an individual, a partnership or corporation)
	that has a tax domicile in Germany (that is, whose place of residence, habitual abode, registered office or place of management
	is in Germany) and by a shareholder without a tax domicile in Germany. This discussion does not cover the treatment of certain
	special companies such as those engaged in the financial and insurance sectors and pension funds. The information is not exhaustive
	and does not constitute a definitive explanation of all possible aspects of taxation that could be relevant for shareholders. The
	information is based on the tax law in force in Germany as of the date hereof (and its interpretation by administrative directives
	and courts) as well as typical provisions of double taxation treaties that Germany has concluded with other countries. Tax law
	can change&mdash;sometimes retrospectively. Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that the German tax authorities or courts may consider
	an alternative assessment to be correct that differs from the one described in this section.

	Subject to the passive foreign investment company rules described
	below, distributions paid on common shares, other than certain pro rata distributions of common shares, will generally be treated
	as dividends to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income
	tax principles). Because we do not maintain calculations of our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles,
	we expect that distributions generally will be reported to U.S. Holders as dividends. Subject to applicable limitations and the
	passive foreign investment company rules described below, for so long as our common shares are listed on Nasdaq or another established
	securities market in the United States or we are eligible for benefits under the Treaty, dividends paid to certain non-corporate
	U.S. Holders will be eligible for taxation as &ldquo;qualified dividend income&rdquo; and therefore will be taxable at rates not
	in excess of the long-term capital gain rate applicable to such U.S. Holders. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding
	the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends in their particular circumstances. The amount of a dividend will include
	any amounts withheld by us in respect of German income taxes. The amount of the dividend generally will be treated as foreign-source
	dividend income to U.S. Holders and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally available to U.S. corporations
	under the Code. Dividends will be included in a U.S. Holder&rsquo;s income on the date of the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s receipt of the
	dividend. The amount of any dividend income paid in euros will be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange
	rate in effect on the date of actual or constructive receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S.
	dollars. If the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder should not be required to recognize
	foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. A U.S. Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend
	is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt.

	Subject to applicable limitations, some of which vary depending
	upon the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s particular circumstances, German income taxes withheld from dividends on common shares at a rate not
	exceeding the rate provided by the Treaty will be creditable against the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s U.S. federal income tax liability.
	German taxes withheld in excess of the rate applicable under the Treaty will not be eligible for credit against a U.S. Holder&rsquo;s
	federal income tax liability. See &quot;German Tax Considerations &ndash; Taxation of Dividends&rdquo; for a discussion of how
	to obtain the applicable treaty rate. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their
	tax advisers regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances. In lieu of claiming a foreign tax
	credit, U.S. Holders may, at their election, deduct foreign taxes, including any German income tax, in computing their taxable
	income, subject to generally applicable limitations under U.S. law. An election to deduct foreign taxes instead of claiming foreign

	Under the Code, we will be a PFIC for any taxable year in which,
	after the application of certain &ldquo;look-through&rdquo; rules with respect to subsidiaries, either (i) 75% or more of our gross
	income consists of &ldquo;passive income,&rdquo; or (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of our assets consist of assets
	that produce, or are held for the production of, &ldquo;passive income.&rdquo; Passive income generally includes interest, dividends,
	rents, certain non-active royalties and capital gains. We believe that we were not a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	for our 2015 taxable year based on (i) certain assumptions regarding the classification of our income and assets for PFIC purposes;
	and (ii) certain estimates as to the value of our assets, including the implied value of our assets based on our market capitalization
	on certain dates. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this conclusion. In addition, whether we will
	be a PFIC in 2016 or any future years is uncertain because, among other things, (i) we currently own a substantial amount of passive
	assets, including cash, (ii) the valuation of our assets that generate non-passive income for PFIC purposes, including our intangible
	assets, is uncertain and may vary substantially over time and (iii) a decline in our market capitalization from levels experienced
	in 2015 may imply a value of our assets (other than cash) that could lead us to conclude that we are a PFIC for 2016 or for a future
	year. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for 2016 or for any other future taxable year. If we are
	a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds common shares, we generally would continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect
	to that U.S. Holder for all succeeding years during which the U.S. Holder holds common shares, even if we ceased to meet the threshold

	the issuance price and the fair value of the embedded derivative. The fair value of the host contract was derived from quoted third

	The fair value of stock options issued by
	Affimed N.V. is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula. The formula determines the value of an option based on input
	parameters like the value of the underlying instrument, the exercise price, the expected volatility of share price returns, dividends,
	the risk-free interest rate and the time to maturity of the option. The fair value of share-based equity-settled compensation plans
	is measured at grant date and compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
	The number of stock options expected to vest is estimated at each measurement date.

	The collaboration consists of a series of linked transactions which in substance form a research and development collaboration.
	Amphivena is a structured entity with one project and uses the funding it receives from investors (which include Affimed) and Janssen
	Biotech Inc., Horsham, USA (in the following Janssen) to pay Affimed for its research and development services. Once approval of
	an investigational new drug application (IND) for the product candidate is obtained, Janssen has an option to acquire Amphivena

	On June 23, 2014, the investors and the
	Company agreed to a conversion of the loan granted by several shareholders as of June 28, 2013 into Series E preferred shares of
	Affimed Therapeutics AG. Subsequently, all preferred shares were exchanged for newly issued common shares of Affimed N.V. (see
	note 2). Through the date of conversion, interest costs of &euro;402 have been recognized in 2014 (2013: &euro;359). A re-measurement
	gain from changes in the fair value of the derivative conversion feature of &euro;6,094 was recognized in 2014 (2013: loss of &euro;5,553).

	In Germany, Affimed has tax losses carried

	million) for trade tax purposes that are available indefinitely for offsetting against future taxable profits of that entity. Restrictions
	on the utilization of tax losses were mitigated through Economic Growth Acceleration Act (Wachstumsbeschleunigungsgesetz). According
	to the provisions of this act unused tax losses of a corporation as at the date of a qualified change in ownership are preserved
	to the extent they are compensated by an excess of the fair value of equity for tax purposes above its carrying amount of the Company.
	The maximum amount of tax losses at risk of being lost due to ownership changes is approximately &euro;59 million. Deferred tax
	assets have not been recognized in respect of any losses carried forward as no sufficient taxable profits of Affimed are expected.

	Expected volatility is estimated based on the observed daily share price returns of selected guideline companies measured over

	returns of Affimed to estimate volatility over a historic period equal to expected life. As of December 31, 2015 weighted average
