	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a biopharmaceutical
	company discovering, developing and commercializing innovative medicines consisting of novel therapeutics paired with diagnostics for the treatment of cancer. We were founded by a team of scientists from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
	Harvard University who sought to develop a systems biology-based approach to biomedical research. The core of our approach to systems biology is to apply multidisciplinary and multitechnology capabilities to build functional and predictive
	computational models of biological systems, such as cell signaling networks, that allow us to engineer treatments that are directed at the mechanisms of disease. We view cancer as a complex engineering challenge. Through systems biology, which
	brings together the fields of biology, computing and engineering, we aim to decrease uncertainty in drug development and clinical validation, and move discovery efforts beyond trial and error. Our mission is to employ these insights to provide
	patients, physicians and the healthcare system with the medicines, tools and information to deliver integrated healthcare solutions that improve both the quality of outcomes and the efficiency of care.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have one marketed therapeutic oncology product and multiple targeted therapeutic oncology candidates in clinical development. Our most
	advanced program is our therapeutic MM-398, which we market in the United States under the brand name ONIVYDE. On October&nbsp;22, 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration, or TFDA, approved
	the use of ONIVYDE in combination with fluorouracil, or 5-FU, and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy in the United States and Taiwan,
	respectively. In addition, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has accepted for review a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, filed by our collaboration partner Baxalta for ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment
	of adult patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have been previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	addition to ONIVYDE and our product candidates in clinical development, we have multiple product candidates in preclinical development and a discovery effort advancing additional candidate medicines. We have tailored ONIVYDE and our other product
	candidates to target specific disease mechanisms that our research suggests are common across many solid tumor types. We believe that ONIVYDE and our other product candidates have the potential to address major unmet medical needs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also developing
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	and
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	diagnostics for use with each of our oncology therapeutic product candidates. Our
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	diagnostic agents employ biophysical or biochemical markers of cancer, or biomarkers, which we have identified using our systems biology approach. Our
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	diagnostics take the form of imaging agents that may help identify
	patients likely to benefit from our therapeutic products by measuring deposition of our products in the tumor. We believe that diagnostics will allow us to improve the efficiency and productivity of our clinical development and enhance the potential
	efficacy and pharmacoeconomic benefit of our therapeutics.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have also entered into an agreement to utilize our manufacturing expertise
	to develop, manufacture and exclusively supply bulk drug product to a third party, who will in turn process the drug into finished product and commercialize it globally following regulatory approval.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	table and descriptions below summarize key information about ONIVYDE (MM-398) and our other clinical stage product candidates, MM-302, MM-121, MM-141 and MM-151. Each of the product candidates described below is a targeted therapy, designed to
	efficiently act on selected cancer cells. These targeted therapies are either designed to deliver cytotoxic therapies to the tumor tissue, such as ONIVYDE and MM-302, or are monoclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibody-derived molecules that are
	designed to block oncogenic signaling pathways, such as MM-121, MM-141 and MM-151. Other than ONIVYDE, none of our product candidates are approved for any indication by the FDA or any other regulatory agency.

	ONIVYDE
	(irinotecan liposome injection), also known as MM-398, is a novel encapsulation of the marketed chemotherapy drug irinotecan in a liposomal formulation. On October&nbsp;22, 2015, the FDA and the TFDA approved the use of ONIVYDE in combination with
	5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy in the United States and Taiwan, respectively. ONIVYDE is the first and only FDA-approved
	therapy in this setting. ONIVYDE is not indicated for use as a single agent. In addition, among other pending applications before regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the EMA has accepted for review an MAA filed by Baxalta for ONIVYDE in
	combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have been previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We hold development and commercialization rights for ONIVYDE in the United States. In September 2014, we established a collaboration with
	Baxalta for the development and commercialization of ONIVYDE outside of the United States and Taiwan. PharmaEngine holds the development and commercialization rights to ONIVYDE in Taiwan. We believe that ONIVYDE may have potential uses in a number
	of other solid tumor indications beyond its currently approved indication, and additional clinical trials of ONIVYDE are ongoing or in the planning stages.

	The basis of the recent FDA and TFDA approvals of ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic
	adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy was our randomized, open label Phase 3 clinical trial of MM-398 in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who received prior
	gemcitabine-based therapy. We refer to this clinical trial as the NAPOLI-1 trial. Patients were enrolled at 76 sites in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. The trial evaluated ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin
	administered every two weeks and as a monotherapy administered every three weeks. Each ONIVYDE containing arm was compared to a control arm of 5-FU and leucovorin. A total of 417 patients were randomized across the three arms. The primary endpoint
	of the trial was overall survival. Overall survival is a measure of the time to death from treatment randomization. Primary survival analysis was based on 313 events and showed that ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin significantly
	improved overall survival versus 5-FU and leucovorin alone: 6.1 months versus 4.2 months (p=0.012, unstratified hazard ratio=0.67, 95% CI: [0.49-0.92]). The monotherapy regimen in this trial did not show improvement over the 5-FU and leucovorin arm:
	4.9 months versus 4.2 months (p=0.94, HR=0.99, 95% CI: [0.77-1.28]). A hazard ratio, or HR, is a measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group over time. In cancer research, hazard
	ratios are often used in clinical trials to measure survival at any point in time in a group of patients who have been given a specific treatment compared to a control group given another treatment or a placebo. A hazard ratio of one means that
	there is no difference in survival between the two groups, while a hazard ratio of greater than one or less than one means that survival was better in one of the groups. The confidence interval, or CI, given after the HR reflects the amount of
	certainty in the estimate of the HR. An HR value that is not contained within a 95% CI is unlikely to be the true HR. ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin also achieved a longer progression-free survival compared with the 5-FU and
	leucovorin arm (3.1 months versus 1.5 months; unstratified HR=0.56). The most common non-hematologic grade 3 and higher adverse events in the ONIVYDE combination arm were fatigue (14%), diarrhea (13%)&nbsp;and vomiting (11.1%). Hematologic grade 3
	and higher adverse events included neutropenia, which was observed in 20% of patients as determined by objective laboratory values, and febrile neutropenia, which was observed in 2% of patients.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In January 2016, we announced an updated overall survival analysis from our NAPOLI-1 clinical trial. The updated data analysis was based on
	378 events and included data from all patients randomized across the three arms of the trial. Twelve-month survival estimates for ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin were 26% (95% CI, 18-35%) compared to 16% (95% CI, 10-24%) for 5-FU and
	leucovorin alone. Six-month survival estimates were 53% (95% CI, 44-62%) for the ONIVYDE combination regimen versus 38% (95% CI, 29-47%) for 5-FU and leucovorin. No new safety or tolerability concerns were noted in the updated data analysis. The
	most common grade 3 and higher adverse events occurring at a 2% or greater incidence in the ONIVYDE containing arms were neutropenia (ONIVYDE monotherapy arm: 15%; ONIVYDE + 5-FU/LV arm: 28%), diarrhea (ONIVYDE monotherapy arm: 21%; ONIVYDE +
	5-FU/LV arm: 13%), vomiting (ONIVYDE monotherapy arm: 14%; ONIVYDE + 5-FU/LV arm: 12%) and fatigue (ONIVYDE monotherapy arm: 6%; ONIVYDE + 5-FU/LV arm: 14%).

	MM-302 is an antibody drug conjugated liposomal doxorubicin that targets the ErbB2 (HER2) receptor. Doxorubicin is a marketed chemotherapy that
	is a member of the anthracycline class of chemotherapeutics. As a liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, MM-302 is designed to target and bind to cancer cells that overexpress ErbB2 (HER2) to allow for the selective uptake of drug into tumor cells
	while minimizing exposure to healthy tissues, such as those of the heart. Unlike other HER2 targeted agents, MM-302 is not designed to inhibit HER2 signaling pathways and relies on HER2 as a means to identify and gain access to the cancer cells.

	We believe that MM-302 may offer advantages in comparison with other forms of doxorubicin, namely free doxorubicin and liposomal
	doxorubicin. Our clinical development strategy is to demonstrate that MM-302 has favorable efficacy and safety for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer where concerns over cardiac safety, particularly in combination with trastuzumab, have led
	to a decline in the use of anthracyclines despite proven efficacy.

	Prior to initiating the HERMIONE trial, we conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial of MM-302 in
	patients with advanced ErbB2 (HER2) positive breast cancer. The purpose of that Phase 1 clinical trial was to assess the safety of MM-302 and identify the maximum tolerated dose. In April 2015, we reported final results from this trial showing that
	the group of patients (n=62) treated with 30 mg/m2 or more of MM-302 alone, in combination with trastuzumab or with trastuzumab and cyclophosphamide, had a median progression free survival, or mPFS, of 7.6 months (95% CI: 3.6-10.9 months) and an
	overall response rate, or ORR, of 11%. Patients who had not been previously treated with anthracyclines (n=25) had an mPFS of 11 months (95% CI: 1.8-13.1 months) and an ORR of 24%. The most frequent adverse events occurring in greater than 20% of
	the population in this trial were constipation (29%), cough (25%), decreased appetite (29%), diarrhea (23%), dyspnea (20%), fatigue (49%), nausea (49%), neutropenia (22%), stomatitis (22%)&nbsp;and vomiting (26%). The most common grade 3/4 adverse

	MM-121 is a fully
	human monoclonal antibody that targets ErbB3, a cell surface receptor that is activated by its ligand heregulin. Heregulin-driven ErbB3 signaling has been implicated as a mechanism of tumor growth and resistance to targeted, cytotoxic and
	anti-endocrine therapies. When used in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, MM-121 is designed to block ErbB3 signaling in order to restore or enhance the anti-tumor effect of a combination therapy partner.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on the central role of heregulin and ErbB3 in cancer growth and survival, we believe that MM-121 may be applicable to a broad range of
	metastatic tumors, including lung, prostate, breast, ovarian, colon and pancreatic cancers. Our preclinical studies of several hundred tumor samples and the analysis of tumor samples from our Phase 2 clinical trials suggest that MM-121 may be able
	to target heregulin-dependent ErbB3 signaling that is relevant in approximately 35-50% or more of cancer patients with these types of tumors.

	endpoint from PFS to overall survival. This trial is expected to enroll approximately 280 heregulin positive patients who will be randomized (2:1)&nbsp;to receive MM-121 plus the investigator&#146;s choice of docetaxel or pemetrexed, or the
	investigator&#146;s choice of docetaxel or pemetrexed alone, at sites in the United States, Canada, Asia and Europe. Eligible patients for the trial must have failed prior treatment with no more than three lines of therapy for locally advanced or
	metastatic disease including, where applicable, with therapies directed against immune checkpoints, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or its receptor, programmed death 1 (PD-1). The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival.
	Secondary endpoints include PFS, objective response rate, safety and quality of life measures.

	We have evaluated MM-121 in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in combination with both chemotherapies and other targeted agents
	across a wide spectrum of solid tumor patient populations, including patients with ovarian, breast and lung cancers. The goal of our MM-121 clinical program is to explore the efficacy and safety of MM-121 in combination with other targeted ErbB
	agents and to establish and validate clinically meaningful biomarkers that were initially identified using our systems biology approach to identify patients most likely to benefit from MM-121.

	Three such previous Phase 2 clinical trials of MM-121 in non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer enrolled a total of 464
	patients and evaluated whether MM-121 in combination with a standard of care therapy was more effective than the standard of care therapy alone in prolonging PFS. In the non-small cell lung cancer trial, two of the three cohorts (Groups A and C) did
	not meet their primary endpoints, and the third cohort (Group B) did not pass its planned interim analysis and ceased enrolling patients. Additionally, we did not meet the primary endpoints in the clinical trials of MM-121 in patients with ovarian
	cancer or in patients with breast cancer, although our biomarker analysis in each trial identified a potential subpopulation of patients benefiting from MM-121 in combination with either paclitaxel or exemestane, respectively. As ErbB3 signaling was
	expected to be active in only a subset of patients, pre-treatment biopsies were collected from patients in the lung and ovarian studies and archived tumor tissue in all three studies to assess heregulin, along with four other pre-specified
	biomarkers. Secondary analyses included evaluation of the pre-specified biomarkers, as well as overall survival and safety data. Across the trials, there was a consistent but modest and tolerable increase in adverse events when MM-121 was combined
	with erlotinib, paclitaxel and exemestane. Most adverse events were reported as mild to moderate in severity and included diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, rash, hypokalemia and stomatitis.

	We
	are developing a diagnostic that is focused on measuring certain mechanistically related biomarkers to determine whether a tumor is dependent on ErbB3 signaling and therefore amenable to treatment with MM-121. In 2014, we announced updated biomarker
	results from a meta-analysis of three randomized clinical trials of MM-121 in patients with ovarian, breast and lung cancers. This analysis included biomarker and efficacy results that had previously been disclosed, as well as additional biomarker
	data from the Phase 2 metastatic breast cancer trial that had not previously been reported. This meta-analysis highlighted heregulin as the principal biomarker for MM-121 efficacy. High levels of heregulin mRNA correlated with favorable hazard
	ratios in all three settings: in ovarian cancer, heregulin-high patients had a PFS HR of 0.37 (95% CI [0.18&#150;0.76]) (57 of 151 evaluable patients; prevalence of 38%); in breast cancer, heregulin-high patients had a PFS HR of 0.26 (95% CI
	[0.11&#150;0.63]) (34 of 76 evaluable patients; prevalence of 45%); in lung cancer, heregulin-high patients had a PFS HR of 0.35 (95% CI [0.16&#150;0.76]) (37 of 69 evaluable patients; prevalence of 54%). In ovarian cancer, the definition of
	biomarker positive also required that patients have low ErbB2 (HER2) levels. In breast cancer, where only ErbB2 (HER2) negative patients were enrolled in the clinical trial, this requirement was not needed. In lung cancer, where ErbB2 (HER2) levels
	are naturally low, this requirement was also not needed.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Heregulin mRNA was measured in two different ways in the Phase 2 clinical
	trials. For archived tissue samples obtained through surgical removal of tumor tissue, which was the source of tissue in the breast cancer clinical trial, heregulin mRNA was measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This
	is a commonly used quantitative assay that provides a measure of the amount of heregulin mRNA in a block of tissue. In tissue samples obtained through a biopsy procedure, which was the source of tissue in the ovarian and lung cancer studies,
	heregulin mRNA was measured by RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH). This is an assay in which a section of tissue is stained for heregulin mRNA and scored by a certified pathologist, and we are using a qualified version of this assay in our Phase 2
	non-small cell lung cancer clinical trial.

	MM-141 is a fully
	human tetravalent bispecific antibody designed to block tumor survival signals by targeting receptor complexes containing the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, or IGF-1R, and ErbB3 (HER3) cell surface receptors. A tetravalent bispecific
	antibody is a single molecule that has four binding sites, two for each of two different target cell surface receptors. IGF-1R and ErbB3 complexes both activate a major signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, that allows tumor cells to grow and develop
	resistance to chemotherapy. We designed MM-141 to suppress the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by reducing the levels of IGF-1R and ErbB3 receptor complexes that trigger the pathway. MM-141 is currently being tested in a Phase 2 clinical trial in
	combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. In 2014, we obtained orphan drug designation in the United States for MM-141 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

	patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients in the Phase 1 trial were enrolled in one of three arms: MM-141 as a monotherapy, MM-141 in combination with everolimus and MM-141 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Trial data showed
	common co-expression of IGF-1R and ErbB3 in solid tumors, and that the presence of this co-expression in metastatic pancreatic cancer was associated with decreased patient survival. An analysis of pre- and post-treatment biopsies confirmed that
	levels of IGF-1R and ErbB3 were decreased following MM-141 administration. Hyperglycemia was rare and was reported as an adverse event of Grade 3 or higher in one out of 38 patients in the trial (2.6%). The most common adverse events in the trial,

	MM-151 is an oligoclonal therapeutic consisting of a mixture of three fully human monoclonal antibodies designed to bind to non-overlapping
	epitopes of EGFR (ErbB1). An oligoclonal therapeutic is a mixture of two or more distinct monoclonal antibodies. EGFR (ErbB1) has long been recognized as an important drug target in several malignancies, including lung, breast, colon, pancreatic and
	head and neck cancers. MM-151 is designed to block the signal amplification that our research suggests occurs in the EGFR (ErbB1) pathway. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of MM-151 in patients with refractory solid tumors.

	We view cancer as a complex engineering challenge. Through systems biology, which brings together the fields of biology, computing and
	engineering, we aim to decrease uncertainty in drug development and clinical validation, and move discovery efforts beyond trial and error. The goal of our systems biology approach is to understand how the complex molecular interactions that occur
	within cell signaling pathways, or networks, regulate cell decisions and how network dysfunction leads to disease. Our platform utilizes proprietary, dynamic biological data generated in a high-throughput method in which we test multiple biological
	or chemical parameters using engineering, analytical and modeling expertise, and from which we build computational models of cell biology to further our drug discovery, design and predictive development. We have developed an expertise in generating
	kinetic data, describing molecular changes or interactions over time, to illuminate the dynamic interactions that occur within biological systems, and apply our insights throughout the research and development process, including for target
	identification, lead compound design and optimization, diagnostic discovery and the design of clinical trial protocols.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our models are
	constructed and validated using internally generated and proprietary data sets. Following the validation of a comprehensive model of a cell signaling network, we are able to use the model for drug discovery. Contrary to traditional methods, a
	significant portion of our discovery work takes place
<I>
	in silico
</I>
	, or using the model for simulation. We believe that this approach is more efficient and productive for drug discovery and development than traditional approaches.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As one example, we identified ErbB3, the target of MM-121, using our proprietary model of the ErbB signaling network after conducting a
	sensitivity analysis on its signaling process. Although the ErbB pathway has been extensively targeted by cancer therapeutics, we believe that understanding the relative importance of the different components of the ErbB network is central to
	identifying an attractive drug target and a therapeutic directed at this target. In this case, we built a computational model of the ErbB signaling network that includes the most potent ErbB receptor ligands, as well as known and novel ErbB
	inhibitors. We populated the model with proprietary dynamic data that we generated from our experiments. The model describes in mathematical equations 700 biochemical reactions representing the ErbB signal transduction network, and identified ErbB3
	as the key node in response to both ErbB3- and EGFR (ErbB1)-binding ligands. We then used this insight to develop MM-121.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Ultimately, we
	believe that systems biology will result in better treatments for complex diseases by providing broader insight into disease and the potential therapeutic alternatives for physicians and patients. Using systems biology, we are incorporating the
	identification of biomarkers and the development of diagnostics into the drug development process. We believe that integrated medicines may enable physicians to deliver the right drug to the right set of patients at the right time. This may improve
	patient outcomes by providing improved therapeutics along with the diagnostic information to guide physician treatment decisions, reduce the overall costs of treating and caring for cancer patients, and provide a basis for seeking favorable
	reimbursement of approved drugs from payors because of the benefits to patients.

	processes to provide maximum flexibility and rapid changeover for the manufacture of different product candidates. We outsource fill-finish, packaging, labeling and distribution. As of January&nbsp;31, 2016, we employed approximately 129 employees
	in manufacturing activities. Our facilities consist of two suites, one for nanoliposome manufacture and one for biologics manufacture.

	Our nanoliposome suite is comprised of multiple classified clean rooms and has been designed to comply with current FDA and EMA cGMP for the
	manufacture of clinical and commercial bulk drug product. The facility and processes have been designed to meet the global commercial and clinical needs of ONIVYDE and the other nanoliposomal products in our pipeline. In 2015, the FDA audited and
	approved our nanoliposome suite for the commercial supply of bulk drug product for ONIVYDE, and in 2016, following inspection, the EMA found us to be in general compliance with the relevant EU manufacturing directives.

	In October 2015, following receipt from the FDA of marketing approval for ONIVYDE, we commenced ONIVYDE commercial activities in the United
	States through our focused field organization. Prior to commercial launch, we spent time and resources building our marketing, field, access and distribution teams to provide healthcare education and reimbursement support as well as our product
	distribution infrastructure. We expect that our commercial infrastructure, which is currently supporting ONIVYDE, will form the basis of the organization that we would use to commercially support our other products, subject to receiving marketing
	approval for those other products. We believe that our commercial infrastructure provides the foundation to address the educational and supportive needs of oncologists who treat a broad array of tumor types, including lung, breast, ovarian,
	pancreatic, colorectal and gastric cancers. Outside the United States, we expect to either enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our other product candidates that obtain marketing approval, or we may

	The biotechnology and
	pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our systems biology technologies, integrated research, clinical and manufacturing
	capabilities, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
	academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in
	the future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development,
	manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even
	more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient
	registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements
	with large and established companies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved,
	are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party
	payors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer,
	more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may
	obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. There are many generic products currently on the market for the
	indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over
	competitive generic products.

	The initial focus of our business is to develop therapeutics and diagnostics for the treatment of solid
	tumor cancers. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease, and accounts for almost one of every four deaths in the United States. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for
	solid tumors. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis, including the active ingredients in ONIVYDE
	and MM-302. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of
	solid tumors and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events, and none of them are successful in treating all patients. As a
	result, the level of morbidity and mortality from solid tumor cancers remains high.

	On September&nbsp;23,
	2014, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Baxter International Inc., Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Baxter Healthcare SA, or the Baxalta agreement, for the development and commercialization of ONIVYDE outside of the United
	States and Taiwan, or the licensed territory. In connection with Baxter International Inc.&#146;s separation of the Baxalta business, the Baxalta agreement was assigned to Baxalta during the second quarter of 2015. As part of the Baxalta agreement,
	we granted Baxalta an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license under our patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize ONIVYDE in the licensed territory. Baxalta is responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to develop,
	obtain regulatory approvals for and, following regulatory approval, commercialize ONIVYDE in the licensed territory. A joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each of Baxalta and us is responsible for approving
	changes to the global development plan for ONIVYDE, including all budgets, and overseeing the parties&#146; development and commercialization activities with respect to ONIVYDE. Unless otherwise agreed, we will be responsible for conducting all

	Under the terms of the Baxalta agreement, we received a $100.0 million upfront, nonrefundable cash payment in September 2014. In addition, we
	are eligible to receive from Baxalta (i)&nbsp;up to an aggregate of $100.0 million upon the achievement of specified research and development milestones, of which we have received $62.5 million from Baxalta as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, (ii)&nbsp;up

	therapy; however, we expect most of these costs to be offset by payments received upon the achievement of clinical trial-related milestones. We will share equally with Baxalta all other clinical trial costs contemplated by the global development

	In November 2000, we entered into a separate exclusive license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, or the Regents.
	Under the agreement, the Regents granted us a royalty-bearing world-wide right and license under certain patent rights for the development and commercialization of products that are covered by the licensed patent rights, including MM-302. The
	agreement requires that we diligently pursue the development, manufacture and commercialization of licensed products. In addition, we are required to meet specified development, regulatory and commercialization milestones within timeframes specified

	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are
	obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays
	by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or
	foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors, including those involved in the filing of a
	new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent
	term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process, provided the total patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term
	restoration period is generally calculated as one-half the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the FDA&#146;s
	approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to each approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with
	the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Similar provisions are available in Europe
	and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. The stated patent exclusivity dates for patent exclusivity outside of the United States may also be eligible for further extension, and/or regulatory market
	and/or data exclusivity in certain countries, upon product approval in individual countries for various reasons, including supplemental protection certificate(s) after product approval in eligible countries outside the United States, and/or
	conducting certain investigations of pediatric exclusivity or use of products covered by the applicable patent.

	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
	Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the
	expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of
	administrative or judicial actions, including, among other things, the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product
	seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.

	with the additional information, which would also be subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals
	in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for non-priority products are reviewed within ten to twelve months after filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs and biologics that the FDA determines
	represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, are reviewed in six to eight months after filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or clarification
	regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or biological products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that
	includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations

	Under the
	FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based on a surrogate endpoint that is
	reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or
	survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or
	post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on
	an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which
	is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic
	identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA
	applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication.
	During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product
	with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or
	condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.

	A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#146;s listed

	If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV
	certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of
	a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of a 30 month period, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a

	The ANDA also will not be approved until

	containing no previously approved active ingredients during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be received by the FDA, except that the application may be submitted in four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. If
	there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following
	approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials
	conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug. Under the BPCA, federal law also provides that periods of patent and non-patent marketing exclusivity listed in the Orange
	Book for a drug may be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor agrees to conduct and report on pediatric studies identified by the FDA in a written request within the statutory timeframes. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority

	After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five year patent term extension. The allowable patent term extension
	is calculated as half of the drug&#146;s testing phase, based on the time between IND application and NDA submission, and all of the review phase, based on the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be

	The FDA is divided into various branches, or Centers, by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic or device
	applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, the FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that the FDA determine the combination product&#146;s primary mode of action,
	or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA or that has expertise in the
	relevant therapeutic area becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other
	combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. When evaluating an
	application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the lead Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center,
	delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more
	than one Center. One reason to submit multiple evaluations is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are
	submitted, each application may be evaluated by a different lead Center.

	The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to create a new licensure framework for biosimilar

	referenced, branded biologic product. Previously, there had been no licensure pathway for such biosimilar or interchangeable products. For purposes of the BPCIA, a reference product is defined as the single biological product licensed under a full
	BLA against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under a follow-on BLA. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of
	administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal
	studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health&nbsp;&amp; Human Services. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of
	demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered

	The FDA published final guidance in July 2014 that addresses issues critical to developing
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	companion
	diagnostics. The guidance provides that
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	companion diagnostics that are essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product must be approved contemporaneously with that therapeutic in most circumstances.
	Based on the guidance and the FDA&#146;s past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will likely require one or more of our
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	diagnostics to obtain PMA in conjunction with approval of the associated therapeutic,
	which will involve coordination of review by CDER and by the FDA&#146;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. Our
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	diagnostics, which are in the form of imaging agents, are
	regulated as drugs by CDER for therapeutic uses. As such, they are generally subject to the regulatory requirements applicable to other new drug candidates.

	Diagnostic tests determined by the FDA to be useful, but not essential, for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product
	are also subject to the same medical device pathways, but their clearance or approval would not be subject to a coordinated review of the diagnostic test and the therapeutic product.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either Class I or II, which
	requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. Some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as
	life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring a PMA. A medical device, including an
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	diagnostic, or
	IVD, to be commercially distributed in the United States must receive either 510(k) clearance or PMA (or be a Class I exempt device that does not require pre-market review) from the FDA prior to marketing.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If any of the diagnostic products under development were determined by FDA not to be essential to the safe and effective prescription of a
	corresponding therapeutic product, it is possible that the diagnostic test could require 510(k) clearance. The FDA&#146;s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months, but it can take significantly longer. The FDA may require
	additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After a device receives
	510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, would require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a PMA. The
	FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) notice or a PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#146;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a
	manufacturer&#146;s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or a PMA for any modifications
	to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

	Devices deemed by the FDA to
	pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device or a preamendment Class III device for which PMA applications have not been
	called, are placed in Class III requiring PMA. The PMA pathway requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction. The PMA pathway generally takes from one to three years or even longer from submission of the
	application. Most companion diagnostic tests have been classified as Class III devices subject to the PMA pathway.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A PMA application for
	an IVD must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data. Preclinical data for an IVD includes many different tests, including how reproducible the results are when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple
	laboratories. The clinical data need to establish that the test is sufficiently safe, effective and reliable in the intended use population. In addition, the FDA must be convinced that a device has clinical utility, meaning that an IVD provides
	information that is clinically meaningful. A biomarker&#146;s clinical significance may be obvious, or the applicant may be able to rely upon published literature or submit data to show clinical utility.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A PMA application also must provide information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design,
	manufacturing and labeling. The sponsor must pay an application fee.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the
	manufacturer&#146;s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which impose elaborate design control, testing, manufacturing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon submission, the FDA determines if the PMA application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and, if so, the FDA
	accepts the application for filing. The FDA then commences an in-depth review of the PMA application. The entire process typically takes one to three years, but may take longer. The review time is often significantly extended as a result of the FDA
	asking for more information or clarification of information already provided. The FDA also may respond with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and
	time-consuming and can substantially delay approval. During the review period, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, likely will be convened to review the application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions,
	the device should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel&#146;s recommendation is important to the FDA&#146;s overall decision making process.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant&#146;s
	agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met,
	the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of
	the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the
	approval.

	Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a
	modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to the information
	needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.

	Clinical trials
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application. All clinical trials of investigational devices must be conducted in
	compliance with the FDA&#146;s requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients pursuant to FDA regulations, the FDA must approve an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application prior to initiation of
	investigational use. IVD trials usually do not require an IDE, as the FDA does not judge them to be a significant risk because the results do not affect the patients in the study. However, for a trial where the IVD result directs the therapeutic
	care of patients with cancer (companion diagnostics), we believe that the FDA would consider the investigation to present significant risk and require an IDE.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in
	humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. Both significant risk and nonsignificant
	risk investigational devices require approval from IRBs at the study centers where the device will be used.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the trial, the sponsor
	must comply with the FDA&#146;s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol,
	control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the
	PMA application for compliance with applicable requirements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the
	requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may
	impose with respect to manufacturing.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After a device is on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These requirements include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the
	FDA&#146;s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or &#147;off label&#148; uses, the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a
	death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur, and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires manufacturers to report recalls and
	field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA
	enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines, injunctions and
	civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for PMA of new products; withdrawing PMAs already granted; and criminal prosecution.

	Any
	drug or biological products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product
	sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse drug experiences. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and
	approval.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may
	require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that
	patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug or biologic.

	In addition, drug and biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and
	distribution of approved drugs and biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP
	requirements. The FDA was also granted new inspection authorities under FDASIA. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and
	correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of

	In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical companies that participate in
	federal healthcare programs like Medicare or Medicaid are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws that may restrict certain marketing practices. These laws include but are not limited to anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The
	federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any
	healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the
	Health Care Reform Laws, amended the intent element of the anti-kickback statute such that liability under the statute can be proved even if a person or entity does not have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This
	statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment,
	criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other
	regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe
	harbor. In addition to the federal anti-kickback statute, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA, makes it a crime to
	knowingly and willfully execute or attempt to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program

	The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to
	be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have initiated investigations or
	brought private lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies for a variety of allegedly improper promotional or marketing activities, such as allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to
	set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, or for engaging in promotion for &#147;off-label&#148; uses.
	Additionally, the Health Care Reform Laws amended the federal False Claims Act such that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute can serve as a basis for liability under the False Claims Act. In addition to the federal civil False Claims
	Act, the federal false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for

	us to any commercial customer (with limited exceptions). The additional rebate is designed to capture price increases that outpace inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index&#151;Urban). The rebate amount is calculated each quarter based on our
	report of current AMP and best price figures for each of our products to the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid and Medicare programs. The requirements for calculating AMP and
	best price are complex. We are required to report any revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our Medicaid rebate liability for prior quarters. In addition, if we fail to provide
	information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the Medicaid statute provides for civil monetary penalties.

	Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with
	certain disabilities or other conditions irrespective of age. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians or other healthcare practitioners, are provided in connection with certain durable medical equipment, or are
	certain oral anti-cancer drugs and certain oral immunosuppressive drugs. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs furnished by physicians under a payment methodology based on the average sales price, or ASP, of the drugs. We report ASP for ONIVYDE.
	Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide ASP information to CMS on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer-submitted information is used to calculate Medicare payment rates. The payment rates for drugs in the hospital outpatient setting are
	also paid on a methodology based on ASP, although that could change on a calendar year basis. CMS also has the statutory authority to adjust payment rates for specific drugs outside the hospital outpatient setting based on a comparison of ASP
	payment rates to widely available market prices or to AMP, which could decrease Medicare payment rates. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.

	Service&#146;s, or PHS&#146;, 340B drug pricing discount program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer&#146;s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree
	to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B &#147;ceiling price&#148; for the manufacturer&#146;s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that
	receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amount for

	Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the
	United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. The Health
	Care Reform Laws expanded healthcare coverage within the United States, primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. This law substantially changes the way
	healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Laws contain a number of provisions that may impact our business and operations. On February&nbsp;1, 2016,
	CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Healthcare Reform Laws. These regulations become effective, in general, on April&nbsp;1, 2016. We are evaluating the impact of these regulations on

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Healthcare Reform Laws also obligate the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, the
	agency which administers the 340B program, to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B program and to update the agreement that manufacturers must sign to participate in the 340B program to obligate a manufacturer to
	offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug available to any other purchaser at any price and to report the ceiling prices for its drugs to the government. HRSA recently issued a proposed regulation regarding the
	calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, as well as proposed omnibus guidance that addresses many aspects of the 340B program,
	including a proposed expansion of manufacturer recordkeeping requirements and 340B ceiling price restatement and refund obligations. HRSA is currently expected to issue additional proposed regulations in 2016. Any final regulation could affect our
	obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. Further, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to
	provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting.

	In addition, beginning April&nbsp;1, 2013, Medicare payments for

	Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for certain drugs, such as self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not
	need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government, and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug
	coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time to time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Manufacturers, including
	us, are required to provide a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.

	Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels. The growing emphasis on managed care in
	the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and
	cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a
	benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct
	expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even with clinical trials, our product
	candidates may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than other products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our products or any of our product candidates that we commercialize, in whole or
	in part.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for
	setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the
	approved drugs for a particular indication, and a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to
	maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. Thus, even if favorable
	coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which
	we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may also suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.

	CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and

	For Medicare and other health insurance programs in the United States, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes, or HCPCS codes, are
	used to ensure that claims for certain items and services (including most drugs) are submitted and adjudicated in an orderly and consistent manner. The HCPCS code set is maintained by CMS and applications for HCPCS codes are submitted to CMS. Based
	primarily on the existence of an HCPCS code that appropriately describes a product, a new product may be assigned to a new or existing HCPCS code and may be the only product or one of several products described by that HCPCS code. For many drug
	HCPCS codes, CMS sets the Medicare payment rate for the code. Presently, HCPCS code J9206 described as &#147;Irinotecan Injection&#148; exists. If ONIVYDE were to be assigned to this HCPCS code, the payment rate for ONIVYDE would not be based

	Beyond the United States, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries
	provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available
	therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for
	human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states
	allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high
	barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country
	that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.

	To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing products with significant market potential. This will
	require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including discovering product candidates, completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and
	manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may seek regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of some of these activities for most of our product candidates, and our commercial activities for ONIVYDE are
	nascent. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a
	quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline

	For example, in February 2015, we stopped enrolling patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-111, a bispecific antibody product candidate,
	for the treatment of advanced gastric, esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers prior to full enrollment based on a recommendation from the Data Safety Monitoring Board for that clinical trial, which cited shorter PFS on the treatment arm
	relative to the control arm in the overall patient population. We do not plan to invest in additional development of MM-111 at this time. In our previous Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-121 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, two of the three
	cohorts (Groups A and C) failed to meet their primary endpoints, and the third cohort (Group B) did not pass its planned interim analysis and ceased enrolling patients. Additionally, we did not meet the primary endpoints in our previous Phase 2
	clinical trials of MM-121 in patients with ovarian cancer or in patients with breast cancer, although our ongoing biomarker analysis in each trial identified a potential subpopulation of patients benefiting from MM-121 in combination with either

	slower than expected enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-121 in combination with exemestane for hormone receptor positive breast cancer. In response, we revised the entry criteria for the clinical trial to correspond with changes in
	clinical practice and also expanded the number of sites and countries participating in the clinical trial. It is possible that slow enrollment in other clinical trials in the future could require us to make similar adjustments. If these adjustments

	respect to ONIVYDE and our other product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and
	biotechnology companies worldwide. Several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies currently market and sell products for the treatment of the solid tumor indications for which we are developing our product candidates. Potential competitors

	We are developing our
	product candidates for the treatment of solid tumors. There are a variety of available therapies marketed for solid tumors. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of these drugs are branded and subject
	to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis, including the active ingredients in ONIVYDE and MM-302. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party
	payors. This may make it difficult for us to achieve our business strategy of replacing existing therapies with our product candidates.

	The regulations that govern marketing
	approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new therapeutic and diagnostic products, including ONIVYDE, vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries,
	the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a
	result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of
	the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval.

	Our ability to commercialize ONIVYDE and any other approved products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and
	reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and managed care organizations. There have been, and we expect
	there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment.
	The federal government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on
	reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit
	payments for pharmaceuticals such as ONIVYDE and the other product candidates that we are developing and could have a material adverse effect our net revenue and results.

	Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels. The growing emphasis on managed care in
	the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and
	cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after
	approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may
	need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even with clinical
	trials, our product candidates may be considered less safe, less effective, of less cost-effective than other products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our products or any of our product candidates that we
	commercialize, in whole or in part.

	The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate
	from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on a formulary, which might not include all of the
	approved drugs for a particular indication, and a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.

	We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and,
	if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, ONIVYDE and any other product for which we obtain marketing approval. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient
	to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with
	products administered under the supervision of a physician. In addition, coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. Thus, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for
	one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale
	may also suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ONIVYDE or any

	We cannot be sure that ONIVYDE will be assigned to a unique HCPCS code that will
	result in Medicare payment. Presently, HCPCS code J9206 described as &#147;Irinotecan Injection&#148; exists. If ONIVYDE were to be assigned to this HCPCS code, the payment rate for ONIVYDE would not be based exclusively on its own pricing
	information but on pricing information for all products assigned to that HCPCS code which, at present, includes both brand name and generic products. This payment rate may be insufficient to enable us to fully realize commercial success.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Payors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer
	price and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. CMS
	surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the NADAC files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. Changes in these
	reimbursement mechanisms may have a material adverse effect on our revenue.

	Moreover, there may be significant delays in obtaining
	reimbursement for ONIVYDE and any other approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries. Eligibility for reimbursement does not imply
	that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs
	and may not be made permanent. Payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed, and may be incorporated
	into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future weakening of laws that presently restrict imports of
	products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly
	obtain coverage and appropriate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for new products that we develop could therefore have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to

	The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain,
	involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors&#146; patent rights are highly
	uncertain. Our and our licensors&#146; pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and
	products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not
	protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are
	typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent
	applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. Under the America
	Invents Act enacted in 2011, the United States moved to this first to file system in early 2013 from the previous system under which the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent. We may become involved in opposition,
	interference or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize
	our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.

	Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful

	non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may
	result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of
	the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such

	We have obtained orphan drug exclusivity in the United States for ONIVYDE for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and orphan medicinal product
	designation in the European Union for MM-398 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have obtained orphan drug designation in the United States for MM-141 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In the United States, under the Orphan
	Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.

	In the United States, the company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition
	receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for that indication for a period of seven years. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same
	orphan indication, except in limited circumstances. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines the term &#147;same drug&#148; to mean a drug that contains the same active molecule and that is intended for the same use as the approved
	orphan drug. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare
	disease or condition.

	With the enactment of the BPCIA as part of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Health Care Reform

	fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners. In addition, effective
	October&nbsp;1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Laws revised the definition of &#147;average manufacturer price&#148; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states.

	Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is
	permitted under the Health Care Reform Laws. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition. Where Medicaid patients
	receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the Health Care Reform Laws, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that
	could impact manufacturer revenues. In addition, the federal government has also announced delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Health Care Reform Laws, including the employer mandate. The implications of these delays for our sales,

	As a condition of reimbursement for ONIVYDE and any other product approved by the FDA, various U.S. federal
	and state healthcare programs require that we calculate and report certain pricing information to U.S. federal and state healthcare agencies. For example, we are required to provide average selling price information to CMS on a quarterly basis in
	order to compute Medicare Part B payment rates. Price reporting and payment obligations are highly complex and vary among products and programs. The calculation of average selling price includes a number of inputs from contracts with wholesalers,
	specialty distributors, group purchasing organizations and other customers. We are also required to make an assessment of whether these agreements are deemed to be for bona fide services and that the services are deemed to be at fair market value in
	our industry and for our products. Our processes for estimating amounts due under these governmental pricing programs involve subjective decisions. As a result, our price reporting calculations are subject to the risk of errors and our methodologies
	for calculating these prices could be challenged under the federal False Claims Act or other laws. In addition, the Health Care Reform Laws modified the rules related to certain price reports and expanded the scope of pharmaceutical product sales to
	which Medicaid rebates apply, among other things. Uncertainty exists currently, as many of the specific determinations necessary to implement this new legislation have yet to be decided and communicated to industry participants. This uncertainty in
	the interpretation of the legislation increases the chances of an error in price reporting, which could in turn lead to a legal challenge, restatement or investigation. If we become subject to investigations, restatements or other inquiries
	concerning our compliance with price reporting laws and regulations, we could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
	condition and results of operations.

	We participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate
	program and other governmental pricing programs, and we have obligations to report average sales price under the Medicare program. Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject
	to interpretation by governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. For example, the Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on our submission to the CMS of our AMP and best price for the quarter. If we become aware that our
	reporting for prior quarters was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally
	were due. Such restatements and recalculations would serve to increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid rebate program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in
	our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the price that we will be required to charge certain safety net providers under the PHS 340B drug discount program.

	We are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data and for overcharging government payers. For example, in addition to
	retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP or best price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of
	false information. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the submission is late beyond the due date. In the event that CMS were to
	terminate our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our products. In addition, if we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or under any other government program, we
	will be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges could result in allegations against us under the federal civil false claims act and other laws and

	Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business operations and/or

	information and personal information, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal

	could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options and warrants, and we may issue shares of our common stock upon conversion of our outstanding convertible

	On December&nbsp;22, 2015, we closed a private placement of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 notes and entered into an
	indenture with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent, governing the 2022 notes. The 2022 notes were sold directly only to qualified institutional buyers within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in reliance
	upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(a)(2) thereof relative to transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. No underwriters were involved in the sales of the 2022
	notes. All purchasers of the 2022 notes represented to us in connection with their purchase that they were qualified institutional buyers and were acquiring the shares for their own account for investment purposes and not with a view to resale or
	distribution thereof in contravention of the Securities Act and that they were capable of evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the 2022 notes and could bear the economic risks of investing in the 2022 notes for an indefinite period of time,
	including the complete loss of their investment. The purchasers received written disclosures that the 2022 notes had not been registered under the Securities Act and that any resale must be made pursuant to a registration statement or an available
	exemption from such registration requirements. We received net proceeds from the private placement of approximately $168.5 million, after deducting private placement and offering expenses payable by us.

	We are a biopharmaceutical company discovering, developing and commercializing innovative medicines consisting of novel therapeutics paired
	with diagnostics for the treatment of cancer. We were founded by a team of scientists from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University who sought to develop a systems biology-based approach to biomedical research. The core of
	our approach to systems biology is to apply multidisciplinary and multitechnology capabilities to build functional and predictive computational models of biological systems, such as cell signaling networks, that allow us to engineer treatments that
	are directed at the mechanisms of disease. We view cancer as a complex engineering challenge. Through systems biology, which brings together the fields of biology, computing and engineering, we aim to decrease uncertainty in drug development and
	clinical validation, and move discovery efforts beyond trial and error. Our mission is to employ these insights to provide patients, physicians and the healthcare system with the medicines, tools and information to deliver integrated healthcare
	solutions that improve both the quality of outcomes and the efficiency of care.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have one marketed therapeutic oncology product and
	multiple targeted therapeutic oncology candidates in clinical development. Our most advanced program is our therapeutic MM-398, which we market in the United States under the brand name ONIVYDE. On October&nbsp;22, 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug
	Administration, or FDA, and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration, or TFDA, approved the use of ONIVYDE in combination with fluorouracil, or 5-FU, and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after
	disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy in the United States and Taiwan, respectively. In addition, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has accepted for review a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, filed by our
	collaboration partner Baxalta for ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have been previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to ONIVYDE and our product candidates in clinical development, we have multiple product candidates in preclinical development and
	a discovery effort advancing additional candidate medicines. We have tailored ONIVYDE and our other product candidates to target specific disease mechanisms that our research suggests are common across many solid tumor types. We believe that ONIVYDE
	and our other product candidates have the potential to address major unmet medical needs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have devoted substantially all of our
	resources to our drug discovery and development efforts, including advancing our systems biology approach, conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property, preparing for commercial launch of ONIVYDE and
	providing general and administrative support for these operations. We began to generate revenue from product sales for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2015 and, to date, have financed our operations primarily through private placements of
	our convertible preferred stock, collaborations, public offerings of our securities and secured debt financings. Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have received $268.2 million from the sale of convertible preferred stock and warrants, $126.7
	million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock during our April 2012 initial public offering and July 2013 follow-on underwritten public offering, $38.6 million of net proceeds from our 2015 &#147;at the market offering&#148; program, or the
	ATM offering, $39.6 million of net proceeds from a secured debt financing, $120.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 4.50% convertible notes due 2020, or the convertible notes, in our July 2013 underwritten public offering, $168.5 million
	of net proceeds from the issuance of 11.50% senior secured notes due 2022, or the 2022 notes, and $434.6 million of upfront license fees, milestone payments, reimbursement of research and development costs and manufacturing services and other
	payments from our collaborations. We have also entered into an arrangement to use our manufacturing capabilities to manufacture drug product on behalf of a third-party pharmaceutical company, for which we have received $3.9 million in upfront fees
	and reimbursements as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $185.6 million.

	At our currently planned spending rates, we believe that our existing financial resources, together with anticipated net product revenues and
	net royalty payments from sales of ONIVYDE and the net milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to receive under our Baxalta collaboration, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.

	On September&nbsp;23,
	2014, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Baxter International Inc., Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Baxter Healthcare SA, which we refer to as the Baxalta agreement, for the development and commercialization of MM-398
	outside of the United States and Taiwan, or the licensed territory. In connection with Baxter International Inc.&#146;s separation of the Baxalta business, the Baxalta agreement was assigned to Baxalta during the second quarter of 2015. As part of
	the Baxalta agreement, we granted Baxalta an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license under our patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize MM-398 in the licensed territory. Baxalta is responsible for using commercially reasonable
	efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and, following regulatory approval, commercializing ONIVYDE in the licensed territory. A joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each of Baxalta and us is
	responsible for approving changes to the global development plan for ONIVYDE, including all budgets, and overseeing the parties&#146; development and commercialization activities with respect to ONIVYDE. Unless otherwise agreed, we will be
	responsible for conducting all clinical trials contemplated by the global development plan for ONIVYDE and manufacturing all clinical material needed for such trials.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of the Baxalta agreement, we received a $100.0 million upfront, nonrefundable cash payment in September 2014. In addition, we
	are eligible to receive from Baxalta (i)&nbsp;up to an aggregate of $100.0 million upon the achievement of specified research and development milestones, of which we have received $62.5 million from Baxalta through December&nbsp;31, 2015,
	(ii)&nbsp;up to an aggregate of $520.0 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones, of which we have received $20.0 million from Baxalta as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, and (iii)&nbsp;up to an aggregate of $250.0 million upon the
	achievement of specified sales milestones. Under the terms of the Baxalta agreement, we will bear up to the first $98.8 million of costs related to the development of ONIVYDE for pancreatic cancer patients who have not previously received
	gemcitabine-based therapy; however, we expect most of these costs to be offset by payments received upon the achievement of clinical trial-related milestones. We will share equally with Baxalta all other clinical trial costs contemplated by the
	global development plan. We are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties ranging from sub-teen double-digits to low twenties percentages of net sales of MM-398 in the licensed territory.

	product-by-product, country-by-country or sub-territory-by-sub-territory basis or in its entirety, for its convenience, upon 180 days&#146; prior written notice. In addition, we may terminate the Baxalta agreement if Baxalta challenges or supports

	technology transfer services based on proportional performance as effort is completed over the expected services period, which is estimated to be substantially complete by June&nbsp;30, 2020. We will periodically review and, if necessary, revise the

	During the second quarter of 2015, the EMA accepted for review an MAA filed by Baxalta for MM-398. As a result of this acceptance, we
	recognized $20.0 million of revenue related to a substantive milestone payment owed from Baxalta. In August 2015, we achieved a $15.0 million milestone related to the submission of the protocol for our Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-398 in front-line
	metastatic pancreatic cancer. This milestone is a non-substantive milestone, and revenue related to the achievement of this milestone will be recognized through the proportional performance revenue recognition model. In October 2015, we achieved an
	additional $47.5 million milestone related to the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-398 in front-line pancreatic cancer. This milestone is also a non-substantive milestone, and revenue related to the achievement of
	this milestone will be recognized through the proportional performance revenue recognition model. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized revenue based on the following components of the Baxalta agreement:

	In September 2009, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Sanofi, which we refer to as the Sanofi agreement, for the
	development and commercialization of MM-121. In June 2014, we agreed with Sanofi to terminate the Sanofi agreement effective December&nbsp;17, 2014. In connection with the agreement to terminate the Sanofi agreement, among other things, Sanofi
	transferred ownership of the investigational new drug application for MM-121 back to us in July 2014, and we waived Sanofi&#146;s obligation to reimburse us for MM-121 development costs incurred after the effective termination date. As a result of
	the termination of the Sanofi agreement, we are not entitled to receive any additional fees, milestone payments or reimbursements from the collaboration.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We received total milestone payments of $25.0 million pursuant to the Sanofi agreement. Under the Sanofi agreement, Sanofi was responsible for
	all MM-121 development and manufacturing costs. Sanofi reimbursed us for internal time at a designated full-time equivalent rate per year and reimbursed us for direct costs and services related to the development and manufacturing of MM-121.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We recognized cost reimbursements for MM-121 development services within the period they were incurred and billable. Billable expenses were
	defined during each specified budget period. In the event that total development services expense incurred and expected to be incurred during any particular budget period exceeded the total contractually allowed billable amount for development
	services during that period, we recognized only a percentage of the development services incurred as revenue during that period.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the
	inception of the collaboration, we determined that the license, the right to future technology, back-up compounds, participation on steering committees and manufacturing services performance obligations comprising the Sanofi agreement represented a
	single unit of accounting. As we could not reasonably estimate our level of effort over the collaboration, we recognized revenue from the upfront payment, milestone payment and manufacturing services payments using the contingency-adjusted
	performance model over the expected development period, which was initially estimated to be 12 years from the effective date of the Sanofi agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of the agreement to terminate the Sanofi agreement, the development period was revised to end as of December&nbsp;17, 2014 and the
	balance of deferred revenue remaining as of April&nbsp;1, 2014 was recognized prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining development period, ending on December&nbsp;17, 2014.

	In November 2013, we entered into a development, license and supply agreement with Watson Laboratories, Inc., or Actavis, which we refer to as
	the Actavis agreement, pursuant to which we will develop, manufacture and exclusively supply the bulk form of doxorubicin HCl liposome injection, or the initial product, to Actavis. The Actavis agreement was subsequently amended in January 2015 to
	transfer certain responsibilities from us to Actavis in exchange for reducing the aggregate milestone payments that we are eligible to receive by $0.4 million. Under the Actavis agreement, Actavis is responsible for all costs related to finished
	product processing and global commercialization. Pursuant to the Actavis agreement, we have also agreed to develop additional products for Actavis in the future, the identities of which will be mutually agreed upon. We are eligible to receive up to
	$15.1 million, of which $3.9 million has been received through December&nbsp;31, 2015, and the remainder is expected to be received in development funding and development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments related to the initial product.
	We will also receive a double digit percentage of net profits on global sales of the initial product and any additional products. We will manufacture and supply the initial product to Actavis in bulk form at an agreed upon unit price.

	The Actavis agreement will expire with respect to the initial product and any additional products developed in the future ten years after
	Actavis&#146; first sale of the applicable product, unless terminated earlier, and will automatically renew for additional two year periods thereafter unless either party provides notice of non-renewal. Either party may terminate the Actavis
	agreement in the event of an uncured material breach or bankruptcy filing by the other party. Actavis may also terminate the agreement for convenience in specified circumstances upon 90 days&#146; prior written notice.

	We applied revenue recognition guidance to determine whether the performance obligations under this collaboration, including the license,
	participation on steering committees, development services, and manufacturing and supply services, could be accounted for separately or as a single unit of accounting. We determined that these obligations represent a single unit of accounting and
	will recognize revenue as product is supplied to Actavis. Therefore, we have recorded $4.0 million and $3.8 million of total billed and billable milestones and development expenses related to the Actavis agreement as deferred revenue as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, respectively. We expect to recognize this revenue over the ten year period that begins after Actavis&#146; first sale of applicable product under the Actavis agreement.

	2015. In addition to these amounts, we could also be required to pay PharmaEngine up to an additional $60.0 million in aggregate regulatory milestones, $38.5 million in sublicense fees and $130.0 million in aggregate sales milestones, in each case
	with respect to Europe and certain countries in Asia. PharmaEngine is also entitled to tiered royalties on net sales of MM-398 in Europe and certain countries in Asia. The royalty rates under the PharmaEngine agreement range from high single digits

	as well sales of ONIVYDE. In the future, we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales, license fees, milestone payments and research, development and manufacturing payments from collaborations and royalties from the sales of products
	developed under licenses of our intellectual property.

	Upon the FDA&#146;s approval of ONIVYDE in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began
	commercially selling ONIVYDE within the United States. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we recognized net product revenues of $4.3 million. As described in further detail below, we estimate our net product revenues by deducting from our
	gross product revenues trade allowances, estimated rebates and chargeback discounts, estimated reserves for product returns and estimated costs of other incentives offered to patients. We expect such net product revenues to increase in 2016 as
	compared to 2015 as ONIVYDE continues to gain market penetration.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	License and collaboration revenues in 2015 under the Baxalta agreement
	increased as compared to 2014, as we have performed a full year of services under the Baxalta agreement. As a result, we recognized additional revenue under our proportional performance revenue recognition model. An additional increase in 2015
	revenue occurred as a result of achieving a $20.0 million substantive regulatory milestone in the second quarter of 2015 related to the EMA&#146;s acceptance for review of an MAA for MM-398. There was not a one-time increase in revenue related to
	either the $15.0 million research and development milestone or the $47.5 million research and development milestone that were achieved under the Baxalta agreement in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. These milestones were
	considered non-substantive milestones and as such were included as part of our proportional performance revenue recognition model and revenue related to them will be recognized as effort is completed over the expected services period of the Baxalta
	collaboration. We expect that revenues recognized in 2016 under the Baxalta agreement will exceed revenues recognized in 2015, as we expect to achieve additional substantive regulatory milestones in 2016 that will result in one time increases to
	license and collaboration revenues.

	We did not recognize any revenue related to the Sanofi agreement during the year ended

	Cost of product revenues consists of manufacturing costs of product sold, including shipping and handling costs, as well as costs associated
	with inventory reserves or write-downs. We began to capitalize costs associated with the production of ONIVYDE upon receipt of FDA approval on October&nbsp;22, 2015. Costs incurred prior to receipt of marketing approval of ONIVYDE were expensed as
	research and development expense.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As we expensed manufacturing costs related to ONIVYDE prior to receiving FDA approval, we expect that
	our cost of product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues will increase in future periods as product manufactured prior to FDA approval is consumed. This cost benefit will vary in future periods based on when the components of the
	specific ONIVYDE lots sold were produced and this benefit is expected to continue to some extent for at least the next twelve months; however, the time period over which this reduced-cost inventory is consumed will depend on a number of factors,
	including the amount of future ONIVYDE sales, the ultimate use of this inventory in either commercial sales, clinical development or other research activities, and the ability to utilize inventory prior to its expiration date. Additionally, we also
	expect that costs of revenues as a percentage of net product revenues will increase in the future as we begin to supply ONIVYDE to Baxalta and PharmaEngine to support their sales outside of the United States.

	We expense research and development costs as incurred. Conducting a significant amount of research and

	late stage clinical trials. We expect to maintain or increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our clinical stage product candidates and further advance our preclinical products and earlier
	stage research and development projects. However, we do not plan to invest in additional development of MM-111 at this time. Such future research and development expenses will include additional regulatory milestone payments that we are required to

	allocate to particular development programs either stock-based compensation expense or expenses related to preclinical programs. Costs that are not directly attributable to specific clinical programs, such as wages related to shared laboratory

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial
	statements, which we have prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated
	financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported
	revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Estimates include revenue recognition, including the estimated percentage of billable expenses in any particular budget period, periods
	of meaningful use of licensed products, estimated service periods and services to be completed under a collaboration, estimates used in accounting for revenue separability and recognition, estimates of discounts and allowances related to commercial
	sales of ONIVYDE, estimates utilized in the valuation of inventory, useful lives with respect to long-lived assets and intangible assets, accounting for stock-based compensation, contingencies, intangible assets, goodwill, in-process research and
	development, tax valuation reserves and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
	about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

	We sell
	ONIVYDE to a limited number of specialty pharmaceutical distributors, or distributors, in the United States. Our distributors subsequently resell the products to healthcare providers. We recognize revenue on product sales when title and risk of loss
	have passed to the distributor, which is typically upon delivery. Product revenues are recorded net of applicable reserves for discounts and allowances.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable, we must be able to reasonably estimate our net product revenues upon delivery to
	our distributors. As such, we estimate our net product revenues by deducting from our gross product revenues trade allowances, estimated contractual discounts, estimated Medicaid rebates, estimated reserves for product returns and estimated costs of
	other incentives offered to patients.

	related sales. Our estimates take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted distributor buying and payment patterns. Actual
	amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we will adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.

<I>
	Trade Allowances:

	Rebates and Chargeback Discounts:
</I>
	We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and the Public Health Service
	340B Drug Pricing Program, contracts with Federal government entities purchasing via the Federal Supply Schedule and various private organizations, such as group purchasing organizations (which we collectively refer to as third-party payors). We
	estimate the rebates and chargeback discounts we will provide to third-party payors, based upon our expected payor mix, and deduct these estimated amounts from our gross product revenues at the time revenue is recognized. Chargeback discounts are
	processed when the third-party payor purchases the product at a discount from the distributor, who then in turn charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the distributor and the discounted price paid by the third-party
	payor. These chargeback discounts are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet at the time revenue is recognized. Rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded as accrued liabilities on the

<I>
	Product Returns:
</I>
	An allowance for product returns is established for
	returns expected to be made by distributors and is recorded at the time revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales. In accordance with contractual terms, distributors have the right to return unopened and undamaged product that
	is within a permissible number of months before and after the product&#146;s expiration date, subject to contractual limitations. We have the ability to monitor inventory levels and the shelf life of product at distributors and can contractually
	control the amount of inventory that is sold to distributors. Based on inventory levels held by distributors and the structure of our distribution model, we have concluded that we have the ability to reasonably estimate product returns at the time
	revenue is recognized. Our estimated rate of return is based on historical rates of return for comparable oncology products.

	We offer co-pay mitigation support to commercially insured patients. Our co-pay mitigation program is intended to reduce each participating patient&#146;s portion of the financial responsibility for a product&#146;s purchase price to
	a specified dollar amount. Based upon the terms of the our co-pay mitigation program, we estimate average co-pay mitigation amounts in order to establish a reserve for co-pay mitigation claims and deduct these estimated amounts from our gross

	We entered into the Actavis agreement in November 2013, which was evaluated under the accounting
	guidance on revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements. We determined that the obligations represent a single unit of accounting and will recognize revenue as product is supplied to Actavis. Therefore, we have deferred total billed and
	billable milestones and development expenses related to this agreement. All milestone payments received and development expenses reimbursed until the period of commercialization will be deferred, and upon commercialization will be recognized over
	the delivery period of the bulk drug product to Actavis.

	Whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single
	unit of accounting, we determine the period over which the performance obligations would be performed and revenue would be recognized. If we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and the level of effort to complete our performance obligations under
	the arrangement, then revenue under the arrangement is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our collaboration agreements may include additional payments upon the achievement of performance-based milestones. As milestones are achieved,
	a portion of the milestone payment, equal to the percentage of the total time that we have performed the performance obligations to date divided by the total estimated time to complete the performance obligations, multiplied by the amount of the
	milestone payment, will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such milestone. The remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period. Milestones that are tied to regulatory approvals are not considered
	probable of being achieved until such approval is received. Milestones tied to counterparty performance are not included in our revenue model until the performance conditions are met.

	We

	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including in-process research and development, or IPR&amp;D, are evaluated for impairment on
	an annual basis or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present. No impairment of goodwill resulted from our most recent evaluation, which occurred in the third quarter of 2015. Our next annual impairment evaluation will be made in the
	third quarter of 2016 unless indicators arise that would require us to evaluate at an earlier date.

	When performing an evaluation of
	goodwill impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. If we elect this option and find, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that
	it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, further testing is not required. This requires us to assess the impact of
	significant events, milestones and changes to expectations and activities that may have occurred since the last impairment evaluation. Significant changes to these estimates, judgments and assumptions could materially change the outcome of the
	impairment assessment. Alternatively, we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. If such an election occurs, in the first step, the fair value of our reporting unit is
	compared to the carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair
	value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We operate in one operating segment, which is
	considered the only reporting unit.

	Our evaluation of IPR&amp;D impairment in the third quarter of 2015 included a qualitative
	assessment to determine whether further impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets was necessary. It was determined that it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed as of the third quarter of 2015 and, therefore,

	for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Definite-lived intangible assets are separate from goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and are deemed to have a definite life.
	We amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives. We have not recorded any impairment charges related to definite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.

	that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services, our actual expenses could differ from such estimates. The date on which some services commence, the level of services performed on or
	before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations. We make estimates based on the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with GAAP. There have been no material changes in estimates for

	We account for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees,
	including stock options, based on the estimated grant date fair values. For employees, we use the straight-line method to allocate compensation expense to reporting periods over each optionee&#146;s requisite service period, which is generally the
	vesting period. For non-employees, we record awards at fair value, remeasure awards to reflect the current fair value at each reporting period and recognize expense over the related service period. When applicable, we account for these equity
	instruments based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.

	We estimate the fair value of stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Determining
	the fair value of stock-based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including volatility, the calculation of expected term, risk free interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among
	other inputs. The assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change, and different assumptions are
	used, our level of stock-based compensation could be materially different in the future.

	We recognize compensation expense for only the
	portion of options that are expected to vest. Accordingly, expected future forfeiture rates of stock options have been estimated based on our historical forfeiture rate, as adjusted for known trends. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant.
	If actual forfeiture rates vary from historical rates and estimates, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods.

	License and collaboration revenues were $84.9 million for 2015 compared to $102.8 million for 2014, a decrease of $17.8 million, or

	related to our collaboration with Sanofi were recognized during 2015. We recognized $92.3 million of license and collaboration revenues under our collaboration with Sanofi during 2014. License and collaboration revenues recognized during 2015 were
	exclusively related to our collaboration with Baxalta and were comprised of a $20.0 million substantive milestone recognized and $64.9 million of revenue recognized under our proportional performance revenue recognition model. We recognized $10.5

	On or after April&nbsp;15, 2020 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity

	The initial conversion rate of the convertible notes is 160 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, which
	is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $6.25 per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of 25% over the public offering price per share of $5.00 in our concurrent underwritten public offering of common
	stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the
	conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its convertible notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances.

	current loans in the aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million was extended. As a result of this amendment, we were required to repay the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the loan beginning on June&nbsp;1, 2016 and continuing through
	November&nbsp;1, 2018. As a result of the FDA&#146;s approval of our NDA for ONIVYDE, which occurred on October&nbsp;22, 2015, we elected to extend the interest-only period by an additional six months so that we would repay the outstanding aggregate
	principal balance of the loans beginning on December&nbsp;1, 2016 and continuing through November&nbsp;1, 2018. In addition, as a result of the FDA&#146;s approval of our NDA for MM-398, we could elect to draw, at any time until August&nbsp;1, 2016,
	an additional term loan advance of up to $15.0 million. Principal and interest payments on the additional term loan advance would be made in the same manner as our current term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million. We did not
	borrow against the additional term loan advance. Upon the earlier of full repayment of the loans or November&nbsp;1, 2016, we were required to pay Hercules a fee of $1.2 million.

	At
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $509.8&nbsp;million and $356.9&nbsp;million, respectively. Included in the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards is
	approximately $36.5 million and $24.7 million, respectively, of deduction related to the exercise of stock options. This amount represents an excess tax benefit, which will be realized when it results in reduction of cash taxes in accordance with
	ASC 718. This excess tax benefit will be directly credited to additional paid-in capital when it is realized. Our existing federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in years through 2035. We also have available research and
	development credits for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $23.7 million and $9.6 million, respectively. The federal and state research and development credits will begin to expire in 2022 and 2026, respectively. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, we also have available investment tax credits for state income tax purposes of $0.8 million, which will expire in years through 2018 if not used. In addition we have federal orphan drug credits of $62.7&nbsp;million that
	begin to expire in 2031. We have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards, deferred revenue and capitalized research
	and development expenses. Under the applicable accounting standards, we have considered our history of losses and concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets.
	Accordingly, we have established a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, &#147;Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),&#148; which supersedes all existing revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific guidance. The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services
	to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive for those goods or services. This guidance was originally effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and allows for
	adoption using a full retrospective method, or a modified retrospective method. Early adoption was originally not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the
	Effective Date,&#148; whereby the effective date for the new revenue standard was deferred by one year. As a result of ASU 2015-14, the new revenue standard is now effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods,
	beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and early adoption is now permitted for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that annual period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that the
	adoption of this guidance and the related transition guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements, including the adoption method to be utilized.

	date the financial statements are issued and providing guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. This guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after
	December&nbsp;15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as a result of this change.

	is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. Accordingly, we elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. As a result, less than $0.1 million of short-term debt issuance costs have been reclassified from &#147;Prepaid expenses and other current assets&#148; to &#147;Long-term debt, current portion&#148; and approximately $0.1

	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and

	under the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
	summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
	company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#146;s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
	regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
	evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
	of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
	loss, statements of non-controlling interest and stockholders&#146; deficit, and statements of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December&nbsp;31,
	2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework
	(2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
	for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;9A. Our responsibility is to
	express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
	reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
	significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
	the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
	circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a
	process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
	company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
	are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
	company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
	reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
	with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a biopharmaceutical company discovering, developing and commercializing innovative
	medicines consisting of novel therapeutics paired with diagnostics for the treatment of cancer. The Company has one marketed therapeutic oncology product and multiple targeted therapeutic oncology candidates in clinical development. The
	Company&#146;s most advanced program is its therapeutic MM-398, which the Company markets in the United States under the brand name ONIVYDE. In addition to ONIVYDE and its product candidates in clinical development, the Company has multiple product
	candidates in preclinical development and a discovery effort advancing additional candidate medicines. The Company has tailored ONIVYDE and its other product candidates to target specific disease mechanisms that its research suggests are common
	across many solid tumor types. The Company believes that ONIVYDE and its other product candidates have the potential to address major unmet medical needs. The Company also has an agreement to utilize its manufacturing expertise to develop,
	manufacture and exclusively supply bulk drug product to a third party, who will in turn process the drug into a finished product and commercialize it globally following regulatory approval. The Company was incorporated in the Commonwealth of
	Massachusetts in 1993 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in October 2010.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties
	common to companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including, among other things, its ability to secure additional capital to fund operations, success of clinical trials, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on
	collaborative arrangements, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and dependence on key personnel. Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development
	efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel, infrastructure and extensive compliance reporting
	capabilities.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company has incurred significant losses and has not generated significant revenue from commercial sales. The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the
	normal course of business.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financings, or through
	existing or new collaboration arrangements. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into additional collaborative arrangements. The terms of any financing may adversely
	affect the holdings or the rights of the Company&#146;s stockholders. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or product candidates. If the Company is unable to obtain
	funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects.

	Use of Estimates
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	GAAP requires the Company&#146;s management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
	revenues, expenses and related disclosures. The Company bases estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant estimates in these
	consolidated financial statements include, but may not be limited to, revenue recognition, including the estimated percentage of billable expenses in any particular budget period, periods of meaningful use of licensed products, estimated service
	periods and services to be completed under a collaboration, estimates used in accounting for revenue separability and recognition, estimates of discounts and allowances related to commercial sales of ONIVYDE, estimates utilized in the valuation of
	inventory, useful lives with respect to long-lived assets and intangible assets, accounting for stock-based compensation, contingencies, intangible assets, goodwill, in-process research and development, tax valuation reserves and accrued expenses.
	The Company&#146;s actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they
	become known by the Company&#146;s management.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
	Investments qualifying as cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds and certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cash accounts with any type of restriction are classified as restricted cash. If restrictions are expected to be lifted in the next twelve
	months, the restricted cash account is classified as current. As of both December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded restricted cash of $685,000, which was primarily related to the Company&#146;s facility lease.

	Marketable Securities
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company
	classifies marketable securities with a remaining maturity when purchased of greater than three months as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities may consist of U.S. government agencies securities, commercial paper, corporate notes and
	bonds and certificates of deposit, which are maintained by an investment manager. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of
	stockholders&#146; deficit until realized. To determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company performs an analysis to assess whether it intends to sell, or whether it would more likely than not be required to sell, the
	security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where the Company intends to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security&#146;s decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the
	unrealized loss is recognized on the statement of operations and comprehensive loss as an other-than-temporary impairment charge. When this is not the case, the Company performs additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to
	evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where the Company does not expect to receive cash flows, based on using a single best estimate, sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a
	security and amount of the loss recognized in other income (expense). Realized gains and losses are recognized in interest income. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income.

	The Company values its
	inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company determines the cost of its inventories, which includes amounts related to materials and manufacturing overhead, on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company performs an assessment
	of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and it writes down any excess and obsolete inventories to their realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should
	they occur, are recorded within cost of product revenues.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with the Company&#146;s
	products after regulatory approval when, based on management&#146;s judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Inventory acquired prior to receipt of marketing approval of a
	product candidate is expensed as research and development expense as incurred. Inventory that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial product is expensed as research and development expense when selected for use in a clinical
	manufacturing campaign.

	Goodwill

	When performing an evaluation of goodwill impairment, the Company has the option to first assess
	qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. If the Company elects this option and finds, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair
	value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, further testing is not required. This requires the Company to assess the impact of significant events, milestones and
	changes to expectations and activities that may have occurred since the last impairment evaluation. Significant changes to these estimates, judgments and assumptions could materially change the outcome of the impairment assessment. Alternatively,
	the Company may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. If such an election occurs, in the first step, the fair value of the Company&#146;s reporting unit is compared to the
	carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the
	reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then the Company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. As described above, the Company operates in one

	The Company has been awarded tax incentives by the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center (&#147;MLSC&#148;), an independent
	agency of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These tax incentives require that the Company achieve certain hiring targets. Failure to maintain the additional headcount in subsequent periods could require the Company to repay some or all of the
	incentives. The Company recognizes the benefit of these incentives on a straight-line basis over the five-year performance period of each award, beginning when the Company achieves the hiring goal target, with a cumulative catch-up recognized in the
	period that the hiring goal target is achieved. The Company has received MLSC tax incentives in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015 totaling $3.8 million in the aggregate, allowing the Company to monetize approximately $3.4 million of state research and
	development tax credits. The Company has recognized $0.7 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million in income related to these tax incentives for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

	The Company accounts for
	income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing
	assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are
	provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

	The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues.
	Reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filing is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit.
	Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are recorded as components of income tax expense. To date, the Company has not taken any uncertain tax positions or recorded any reserves, interest or penalties.

	Financial
	instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash deposits in accredited financial institutions and, therefore, the
	Company&#146;s management believes these funds are subject to minimal credit risk. The Company invests cash equivalents and marketable securities in money market funds, U.S. government agencies securities and various corporate debt securities.
	Credit risk in these securities is reduced as a result of the Company&#146;s investment policy to limit the amount invested in any one issue or any single issuer and to only invest in high credit quality securities. The Company has no significant
	off-balance sheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign currency exchange contracts, option contracts or other hedging arrangements. The Company also is subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable related to its product sales and
	collaborators. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of each of its customers and has determined that all of its customers are creditworthy. To date, the Company has not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of its
	accounts receivable.

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2014-09,
	&#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),&#148; which supersedes all existing revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific guidance. The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers
	goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive for those goods or services. This guidance was originally effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016
	and allows for adoption using a full retrospective method, or a modified retrospective method. Early adoption was originally not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
	Deferral of the Effective Date,&#148; whereby the effective date for the new revenue standard was deferred by one year. As a result of ASU 2015-14, the new revenue standard is now effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual
	periods, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and early adoption is now permitted for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the potential
	impact that the adoption of this guidance and the related transition guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements, including the adoption method to be utilized.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of
	Uncertainties about an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,&#148; outlining management&#146;s responsibility to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the
	date the financial statements are issued and providing guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. This guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after
	December&nbsp;15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this change.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, &#147;Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
	Issuance Costs,&#148; which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This update
	is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. As a result, less than $0.1 million of short-term debt issuance costs have been reclassified from &#147;Prepaid expenses and other current assets&#148; to &#147;Long-term debt, current portion&#148; and approximately $0.1
	million of long-term debt issuance costs have been reclassified from &#147;Other assets&#148; to &#147;Long-term debt, net of current portion&#148; on the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. This early adoption
	had no impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for any period presented.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In July 2015,
	the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, &#147;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,&#148; to simplify the subsequent measurement of inventory. Entities are now required to subsequently measure inventory at the lower of cost or net
	realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market. This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted.
	Accordingly, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-11 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. There was no impact to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this change.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, &#147;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,&#148; to
	simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2016,
	including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. There was no impact to the consolidated financial
	statements as a result of this change.

	The aggregate fair value of securities held by the Company in an unrealized loss position for less than 12
	months as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 was $88.4 million, representing 35 securities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company did not intend to sell, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell, the investments in
	an unrealized loss position before recovery of their amortized cost bases. The Company determined that there was no material change in the credit risk of the investments. As a result, the Company determined it did not hold any investments with an
	other-than-temporary-impairment as of December&nbsp;31, 2014.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
	number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
	share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, convertible preferred stock, stock options and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in
	the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As discussed in Note 11, &#147;Borrowings,&#148; in July
	2013, the Company issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the &#147;Convertible Notes&#148;) in an underwritten public offering. Following the repayment and satisfaction in full of the
	Company&#146;s obligations to Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (&#147;Hercules&#148;) under its Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules (the &#147;Loan Agreement&#148;), which occurred in December 2015, upon any conversion of the
	Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes may be settled, at the Company&#146;s election, in cash, shares of the Company&#146;s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. For purposes of calculating the
	maximum dilutive impact, it is presumed that the conversion premium will be settled in common stock, inclusive of a contractual make-whole provision resulting from a fundamental change, and the resulting potential common shares included in diluted
	earnings per share if the effect is more dilutive.

	The stock options, warrants and conversion premium on the Convertible Notes are
	excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because the net loss for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 causes such securities to be anti-dilutive. Securities excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share are

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On
	September&nbsp;23, 2014, the Company and Baxter International Inc., Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Baxter Healthcare SA entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the &#147;Baxalta Agreement&#148;) for the development and
	commercialization of MM-398 outside of the United States and Taiwan (the &#147;Licensed Territory&#148;). In connection with Baxter International Inc.&#146;s separation of the Baxalta business, the Baxalta Agreement was assigned to Baxalta during
	the second quarter of 2015. As part of the Baxalta Agreement, the Company granted Baxalta an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license under the Company&#146;s patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize MM-398 in the Licensed
	Territory. Baxalta is responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and, following regulatory approval, commercializing MM-398 in the Licensed Territory. A joint steering committee comprised of an
	equal number of representatives from each of Baxalta and the Company is responsible for approving changes to the global development plan for MM-398, including all budgets, and overseeing the parties&#146; development and commercialization activities
	with respect to MM-398. Unless otherwise agreed, the Company will be responsible for conducting all clinical trials contemplated by the global development plan for MM-398 and manufacturing all clinical material needed for such trials.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of the Baxalta Agreement, the Company received a $100.0 million upfront, nonrefundable cash payment in September 2014. In
	addition, the Company is eligible to receive from Baxalta (i)&nbsp;up to an aggregate of $100.0 million upon the achievement of specified research and development milestones, of which the Company has received $62.5 million from Baxalta through
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, (ii)&nbsp;up to an aggregate of $520.0 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones, of which the Company has received $20.0 million from Baxalta as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, and (iii)&nbsp;up to an
	aggregate of $250.0 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones. Under the terms of the Baxalta Agreement, the Company will bear up to the first $98.8 million of costs related to the development of MM-398 for pancreatic cancer
	patients who have not previously received gemcitabine-based therapy; however, the Company expects most of these costs to be offset by payments received upon the achievement of clinical trial-related milestones. The Company and Baxalta will share
	equally all other clinical trial costs contemplated by the global development plan. The Company is also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties ranging from sub-teen double-digits to low twenties percentages of net sales of MM-398 in the Licensed
	Territory.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company and Baxalta expect to enter into a commercial supply agreement pursuant to which the Company will supply MM-398
	bulk drug substance to Baxalta and, at Baxalta&#146;s option, may manage fill and finish activities to be conducted by a third-party contract manufacturer for Baxalta. Baxalta also has the option to manufacture MM-398 itself, in which case the
	Company will perform a technology transfer of its manufacturing process to Baxalta.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If not terminated earlier by either party, the
	Baxalta Agreement will expire upon expiration of all royalty and other payment obligations of Baxalta under the Baxalta Agreement. Either party may terminate the Baxalta Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party.
	Baxalta may also terminate the Baxalta Agreement on a product-by-product, country-by-country or sub-territory-by-sub-territory basis or in its entirety, for its convenience, upon 180 days&#146; prior written notice. In addition, the Company may
	terminate the Baxalta Agreement if Baxalta challenges or supports any challenge of the Company&#146;s licensed patent rights.

	At the inception of the collaboration, the Company identified the following deliverables as part
	of the Baxalta Agreement: (i)&nbsp;license to develop and commercialize MM-398 in Baxalta&#146;s territories, (ii)&nbsp;discovery, research, development and manufacturing services required to complete ongoing clinical trials related to MM-398,
	(iii)&nbsp;discovery, research, development and manufacturing services needed to complete future clinical trials in further indications related to MM-398, (iv)&nbsp;the option to perform a technology transfer of the Company&#146;s manufacturing
	process related to the production of MM-398 to Baxalta and (v)&nbsp;participation on the joint steering committee.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company concluded
	that none of the deliverables identified at the inception of the collaboration has standalone value from the other undelivered elements. As such, all deliverables represent a single unit of accounting.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company has determined that the collaboration represents a services agreement and as such has estimated the level of effort expected to be
	completed as a result of providing the identified deliverables. The Company will recognize revenue from the non-refundable upfront payment, forecasted non-substantive milestone payments and estimated payments related to discovery, research,
	development and technology transfer services based on proportional performance as effort is completed over the expected services period, which is estimated to be substantially complete by June&nbsp;30, 2020. The Company will periodically review and,
	if necessary, revise the estimated service period related to its collaboration with Baxalta. As of December, 31, 2015, the Company has achieved $62.5 million of the $90.0 million of forecasted non-substantive milestones milestones that are included
	in the Company&#146;s proportional performance revenue recognition model and $20.0 million of the $530.0 million of substantive milestones included in the Baxalta Agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Research, development and regulatory milestones that are considered substantive on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone will be
	recognized as revenue in full in the period in which the associated milestone is achieved, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. All sales milestones will be accounted for in the same manner as royalties and recorded as revenue
	upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the second quarter of 2015, the
	European Medicines Agency (&#147;EMA&#148;) accepted for review a Marketing Authorization Application (&#147;MAA&#148;) filed by Baxalta for MM-398. As a result of this acceptance, the Company recognized $20.0 million of revenue related to a
	substantive milestone payment owed from Baxalta. In August 2015, the Company achieved a $15.0 million milestone related to the submission of the protocol for the Company&#146;s Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-398 in front-line metastatic pancreatic
	cancer. This milestone is a non-substantive milestone, and revenue related to the achievement of this milestone will be recognized through the proportional performance revenue recognition model. In October 2015, the Company achieved an additional
	$47.5 million milestone related to the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-398 in front-line pancreatic cancer. This milestone is also a non-substantive milestone, and revenue related to the achievement of this
	milestone will be recognized through the proportional performance revenue recognition model. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized revenue based on the following components of the Baxalta Agreement:

	On September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Company and Sanofi entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the &#147;Sanofi Agreement&#148;) for
	the development and commercialization of MM-121. The Sanofi Agreement became effective on November&nbsp;10, 2009, and Sanofi paid the Company a nonrefundable, noncreditable upfront license fee of $60.0 million. On June&nbsp;17, 2014, the Company and
	Sanofi agreed to terminate the Sanofi Agreement effective December&nbsp;17, 2014. In connection with the agreement to terminate the Sanofi Agreement, among other things, Sanofi transferred ownership of the investigational new drug application for
	MM-121 back to the Company in July 2014, and the Company waived Sanofi&#146;s obligation to reimburse the Company for MM-121 development costs incurred after the effective termination date. Following the termination of the Sanofi Agreement, the
	Company is not entitled to receive any additional fees, milestone payments or reimbursements from the collaboration.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company received
	total milestone payments of $25.0 million pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement. Under the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi was responsible for all MM-121 development and manufacturing costs. Sanofi reimbursed the Company for direct costs incurred in both
	development and manufacturing and compensated the Company for its internal development efforts based on a full time equivalent rate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	Company recognized cost reimbursements for MM-121 development services within the period they were incurred and billable. Billable expenses were identified during each specified budget period. In the event that total development services expense
	incurred and expected to be incurred during the same period exceeded the total contractually allowed billable amount for development services during that period, the Company recognized only a percentage of the development services incurred as
	revenue during that period.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the inception of the collaboration, the Company determined that the license, the right to future
	technology, back-up compounds, participation on steering committees and manufacturing services performance obligations comprising the Sanofi Agreement represented a single unit of accounting. As the Company could not reasonably estimate its level of
	effort over the collaboration, the Company recognized revenue from the upfront payment, milestone payment and manufacturing services payments using the contingency-adjusted performance model over the expected development period, which was initially
	estimated at 12 years from the effective date of the Sanofi Agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of the Company and Sanofi agreeing to terminate the
	Sanofi Agreement, the development period was revised to end as of December&nbsp;17, 2014. Accordingly, the balance of the deferred revenue remaining on April&nbsp;1, 2014 was recognized prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining
	development period, ending on December&nbsp;17, 2014, in accordance with current generally accepted principles on revenue recognition.

	The Company recognized no revenue under the Sanofi agreement during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. During the years ended

	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
	orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is determined based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect certain market
	assumptions. As a basis for considering such assumptions, GAAP establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to develop the assumptions and for measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted
	prices in active markets for identical assets; (Level 2) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which
	requires the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.

	As part of the acquisition of Hermes on October&nbsp;6, 2009 (the &#147;Acquisition Date&#148;), the Company recognized acquired IPR&amp;D of
	$7.0 million related to several development programs: an antibody-targeted nanotherapeutic that contains a chemotherapy drug, a nanotherapeutic that contains a chemotherapy drug and other early-stage preclinical programs in the amounts of $2.8
	million, $3.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The Company also acquired intangible assets of $3.2 million related to core nano-carrier technology. These values were determined at the time of acquisition by estimating the costs to develop the
	acquired IPR&amp;D into commercially viable products, estimating the net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The probability of success factors and discount rates used for each project
	considered the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired IPR&amp;D.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the fourth quarter of 2015, upon the
	approval of ONIVYDE by the FDA, the Company reclassified the acquired IPR&amp;D asset related to the nanotherapeutic that contains a chemotherapy drug to definite-lived intangible assets and commenced amortization. This definite-lived ONIVYDE
	intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis through 2028. Amortization of the acquired IPR&amp;D asset related to the antibody-targeted nanotherapeutic that contains a chemotherapy drug has not commenced as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The
	deprioritization and delay of the other early-stage preclinical programs during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 resulted in an impairment charge of $0.8 million recognized during the third quarter of 2013. The core nano-carrier technology
	intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of ten years, which is management&#146;s best estimate of the useful life of this technology. The weighted-average remaining amortization period for the Company&#146;s
	intangible assets subject to amortization is approximately 10.6 years as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	by the supplemental indenture, dated as of July&nbsp;17, 2013, between the Company and the Convertible Notes Trustee (together with the Base Indenture, the &#147;Wells Fargo Indenture&#148;). As a result of the Convertible Notes offering, the
	Company received net proceeds of approximately $120.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company.

	The Company has separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes by bifurcating gross proceeds between
	the indebtedness, or liability component, and the embedded conversion option, or equity component. This bifurcation was done by estimating an effective interest rate as of the date of issuance for similar notes which do not contain an embedded
	conversion option. This effective interest rate was estimated to be 15% and was used to compute the initial fair value of the indebtedness of $71.2 million. The gross proceeds received from the issuance of the Convertible Notes less the initial
	amount allocated to the indebtedness resulted in a $53.8 million allocation to the embedded conversion option. The embedded conversion option was recorded in stockholders&#146; deficit and as debt discount, to be subsequently amortized as interest
	expense over the term of the Convertible Notes. Underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses totaled $4.4 million and were allocated to the indebtedness and the embedded conversion option based on their relative values. As a result,
	$2.5 million attributable to the indebtedness was recorded as debt discount, to be subsequently amortized as interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes, and $1.9 million attributable to the embedded conversion option was netted with the
	embedded conversion option in stockholders&#146; deficit.

	In November 2012, the Company entered into the Loan Agreement with Hercules pursuant to which the Company received loans in the aggregate
	principal amount of $40.0 million. The Company, as permitted under the Loan Agreement, had previously extended the interest-only payment period with the aggregate principal balance of the loans to be repaid in monthly installments starting on
	June&nbsp;1, 2014 and continuing through November&nbsp;1, 2016. On June&nbsp;25, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement, whereby the Company and Hercules agreed to extend until October&nbsp;1, 2014 the period during which
	the Company makes interest-only payments. On November&nbsp;6, 2014, the Company entered into a further amendment to the Loan Agreement, whereby the Company and Hercules agreed to extend by four additional months the period during which the Company
	makes interest-only payments. On February&nbsp;25, 2015, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Company and Hercules agreed to extend the maturity date and the period during which the Company makes
	interest-only payments on its current loans in the aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million. As a result of this amendment, the Company was required to repay the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the loan beginning on June&nbsp;1, 2016
	and continuing through November&nbsp;1, 2018. As a result of the FDA&#146;s approval of the Company&#146;s NDA for ONIVYDE, which occurred on October&nbsp;22, 2015, the Company elected to extend the interest-only period by an additional six months
	such that the Company would repay the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the loans beginning on December&nbsp;1, 2016 and continuing through November&nbsp;1, 2018. This amendment was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon the earlier of full repayment of the loans or November&nbsp;1, 2016, the Company was required to pay Hercules a fee of $1.2 million,
	which had been recorded as a discount to the loans and as a long-term liability on the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company reimbursed Hercules for costs incurred related to the loans, which was reflected as a
	discount to the carrying value of the loans. The Company amortized these loan discounts totaling $1.6 million to interest expense over the term of the loans using the effective interest method.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company granted Hercules a security interest in all of the Company&#146;s personal property now

	conjunction with the issuance of the 2022 Notes. The total repayment amount included the $40.0 million in outstanding principal, the $1.2 million fee discussed above and interest accrued up through the repayment date. The Company assessed the
	repayment of the Loan Agreement with Hercules in conjunction with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, of which Hercules holds a portion, in accordance with the debt extinguishment and modification guidance per ASC 480. Based upon this assessment, the
	Company concluded that this transaction represented a debt modification, and accordingly, $0.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Loan Agreement will be amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the life of the 2022
	Notes using the effective interest method. In addition, $0.9 million of debt issuance costs associated with the 2022 Notes were allocated to the modified Loan Agreement and expensed as a component of &#147;Interest expense&#148; on the consolidated

	In December 2012, the Company&#146;s majority owned subsidiary, Silver Creek, entered into a Note Purchase
	Agreement pursuant to which it issued convertible notes to various lenders in aggregate principal amounts of $1.6 million in December 2012, $0.9 million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and $1.0 million during the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014. The notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement bore interest at 6%&nbsp;per annum. Upon issuance, these convertible notes contained a feature wherein if at any time prior to maturity Silver Creek enters into a
	qualifying equity financing, defined as a sale or series of related sales of equity securities prior to the maturity date and resulting in at least $4.0 million of gross proceeds, the notes would automatically convert into the next qualifying equity
	financing at a 25% discount. The Company determined that this convertible feature met the definition of a derivative and required separate accounting treatment. The derivative was estimated to be valued at $0.2 million for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2012 using a probability-weighted model and was recorded as derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, the derivative was remeasured upon conversion of the notes
	with the gain in remeasurement recognized in other income. The specific notes that were outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 matured and converted, along with an immaterial amount of accrued interest into shares of Silver Creek Series A
	preferred stock on both December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013. Upon conversion, the Company&#146;s ownership percentage of Silver Creek outstanding preferred stock decreased from 74% as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 to 64% as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 to 60%
	as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, and a $0.4 million and $0.8 million increase to non-controlling interest was recognized as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013, respectively.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2008, the Company adopted the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended, the &#147;2008 Plan&#148;) for employees, officers, directors,
	consultants and advisors. The 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;2011 Plan&#148;) became effective upon closing of the Company&#146;s initial public offering in April 2012. Upon effectiveness of the 2011 Plan, no further awards were available to
	be issued under the 2008 Plan. The 2011 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors of the Company and permits the Company to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and
	other stock-based awards. Additional shares also become available for grant by reason of the forfeiture, cancellation, expiration or termination of existing awards. The Company registered 3.4&nbsp;million, 3.6&nbsp;million and 3.7&nbsp;million of
	additional shares of common stock related to the 2011 Plan in February 2013,&nbsp;March 2014 and February 2015, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, there were 2.5&nbsp;million shares remaining available for grant under the 2011 Plan.

	During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company issued options to purchase 3.7&nbsp;million, 3.9&nbsp;million and
	3.3&nbsp;million shares of common stock, respectively. These options generally vest over a three-year period for employees. Options granted to directors during the period from April 2012 through December 2013 vest over a one-year period. All other
	options granted to directors vest immediately. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company also issued options to purchase less than 0.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock to non-employees. The assumptions used to estimate the fair
	value of options granted to non-employees at the date of grant were materially consistent with those used for employee and director grants. The Company did not grant any options to purchase common stock to non-employees during the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 or 2014.

	The Company uses the simplified method to calculate the expected term, as it does not have sufficient
	historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on
	industry and market capitalization. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Management estimates expected forfeitures based on historical experience and
	recognizes compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.

	However, to the extent the Company utilizes net operating losses from years prior to 2011, the statute remains open to the extent of the net operating losses utilized. The Company&#146;s policy is to recognize interest and penalties for uncertain

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state
	income tax purposes of $509.8 million and $356.9 million, respectively. Included in the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards is approximately $36.5 million and $24.7 million, respectively, of deduction related to the exercise of stock
	options. This amount represents an excess tax benefit, which will be realized when it results in reduction of cash taxes in accordance with ASC 718. This excess tax benefit will be directly credited to additional paid-in capital when it is realized.
	The Company&#146;s existing federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in years through 2035. The Company also has available research and development credits for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $23.7
	million and $9.6 million, respectively. The federal and state research and development credits will begin to expire in 2022 and 2026, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company also had available investment tax credits for state income
	tax purposes of $0.8 million, which will expire in years through 2018 if unused. In addition, the Company has federal orphan drug credits of $62.7 million which begin to expire in 2031. The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence
	bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards, deferred revenue and capitalized research and development expenses. Under the applicable accounting standards, the
	Company has considered its history of losses and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company has established a full valuation allowance
	against the deferred tax assets.

	Utilization of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject
	to a substantial annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Internal Revenue Code&#148;), due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future.
	These ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax. The Company has not currently completed an evaluation of
	ownership changes through December&nbsp;31, 2015 to assess whether utilization of the Company&#146;s net operating loss or research and development credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal
	Revenue Code. To the extent an ownership change occurs in the future, the net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation.

	The Company has not yet conducted a study of its domestic research and development credit carryforwards and orphan drug credits. This study
	may result in an increase or decrease to the Company&#146;s credit carryforwards; however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position. A full valuation allowance has been
	provided against the Company&#146;s credits, and if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the valuation allowance. As a result, there would be no impact to the consolidated statements of operations and
	comprehensive loss or consolidated statements of cash flows if an adjustment were required.
