	candidate, NeoCart

</SUP>
	, is being investigated in a Phase 3 clinical trial. NeoCart utilizes various aspects of our regenerative medicine platform to develop an innovative tissue implant intended
	to treat tissue injury in the field of orthopedics, specifically cartilage damage in the knee. Joint, or articular, cartilage covers the ends of bones and allows for joints to glide smoothly with minimal friction. Cartilage damage, or chondral
	defects, can be caused by acute trauma, such as a bad fall or sports-related injury, or by repetitive trauma, such as general wear over time. Unlike other tissues in the body, joint cartilage has no innate ability to repair itself, making any injury
	permanent. Left untreated, even a small defect can expand in size and progress to debilitating arthritis, ultimately necessitating a joint replacement procedure. We have no products that are approved for sale in the United States and currently we
	are not selling any other products that may be approved for sale in other jurisdictions. NeoCart is based on our regenerative medicine platform, which combines expertise in the following areas:

	NeoCart is a cartilage-like implant created using a patient&#146;s own cartilage cells through a series of tissue engineering processes. First, the
	patient&#146;s cells are separated from a tissue biopsy specimen extracted from the patient and multiplied in our laboratory. The cells are then infused into our proprietary scaffold that provides structure for the developing implant. Before NeoCart
	is implanted in a patient, the cell- and scaffold construct undergoes a bioengineering process in our Tissue Engineering Processor (TEP). Our TEP is designed to mimic the conditions found in a joint so that the implant is prepared to begin
	functioning like normal healthy cartilage prior to implantation. When NeoCart is implanted, a bioadhesive is used to anchor NeoCart in the cartilage injury and seal the implant to the surrounding native cartilage interface. The use of the
	bioadhesive eliminates the need for complicated suturing, and the cartilage implant integrates to the surrounding native cartilage. We believe that the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials provide preliminary evidence for the safety of the NeoCart
	implant and improvement in pain and function in patients treated with NeoCart.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are currently enrolling a Phase 3 clinical trial for NeoCart in the
	United States to provide evidence of the safety and effectiveness of NeoCart, studying cartilage defects in the knees of 245 patients under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
	Pursuant to the SPA, we formally and prospectively reached agreement with the FDA on key elements of the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol, including design, endpoints and statistical analyses of the resulting study data. The SPA is binding on the FDA
	review division with limited exceptions. If the clinical trial is successful, the data may be used to support efficacy claims for NeoCart approval and demonstrate clinical superiority over the current standard of care, microfracture. Microfracture
	consists of the creation of tiny holes or &#147;fractures&#148; in the bone underneath the injured cartilage leading to formation of a blood clot in the affected area. The blood and bone marrow that form the clot contain stem cells, which are
	thought to grow into cartilage-building cells, as well as growth factors to support cell function and development of replacement cartilage matrix.

	clinical development activities for NeoCart. During the second and third quarters of 2015, we made several changes in our enrollment processes for the Phase 3 clinical trial which we believe will
	positively impact future enrollment rates. These changes include, among others: (i)&nbsp;a shift away from national advertising and toward local advertising done in conjunction with specific physicians and sites; (ii)&nbsp;streamlining the

	Musculoskeletal-related conditions, including
	cartilage damage, are one of the most prevalent health problems in the United States. Based on recent publications, we estimate that 1,000,000 knee arthroscopies are performed each year in the United States and we believe cartilage damage is likely
	to be identified in over 60% of those knee arthroscopies. Cartilage damage is a leading cause of osteoarthritis, a chronic condition in which cartilage breaks down, and the condition most responsible for the estimated 750,000 knee replacements
	performed in the United States annually. We believe the current alternatives available to treat cartilage damage in the knee, including microfracture, the most frequently used procedure for severe cartilage damage, inadequately address this
	condition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe NeoCart would represent a superior solution to treat cartilage damage in the knee because it has the potential to solve for the
	limitations of the current treatment alternatives and has the potential to provide improved efficacy, long-term patient benefits, accelerated patient recovery and predictable patient outcomes through a technically straightforward surgical procedure.
	If we are able to successfully complete our Phase 3 clinical trial, we believe these advantages may assist in securing approval to sell NeoCart in the United States and may enable us to become a market leader in cartilage repair.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We estimate, based on internal research, that over 500,000 knee cartilage procedures are performed annually in the United States, primarily in the form of
	debridement, microfracture, conventional autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and osteochondral grafting. Debridement and microfracture procedures are the most frequently performed surgical procedures for the treatment of cartilage damage,
	accounting for an estimated 90% of all such procedures according to materials from a 2009 meeting of the Cellular Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee of the FDA. Debridement is an arthroscopic procedure that involves removal of injured or
	loose tissue debris by shaving, cutting or scraping it. Debridement does not attempt to repair cartilage damage. The surgeon&#146;s only goal when performing debridement is to improve a patient&#146;s symptoms of pain or loss of function.

	activities for the first six weeks and use continuous passive motion machines for several hours per day. Prolonged physical therapy is often recommended. Such requirements and restrictions are believed necessary to optimize the anatomic and clinical
	results of microfracture, but come at the cost of muscle weakening, quality of life and delayed resumption of activities.

	Technically Demanding Surgeries:

</B>
	ACI is a slurry of autologous cartilage cells formed from a biopsy of a patient&#146;s cartilage and grown over six to eight weeks. A patch or cover is often sutured into
	the surrounding healthy cartilage to hold the slurry in place or cells are delivered on a scaffold and affixed with an adhesive. Osteochondral grafting, whether using the patient&#146;s own cells or using another person&#146;s tissue, consists of a
	circular plug of bone and cartilage press-fit into the defect and can be challenging to perform because of the difficulty of achieving an exact match, fit and placement of the graft.

	Scaffolds are structures capable of supporting three-dimensional tissue formation and providing an environment for the cells that are needed to form the tissue. Our proprietary,

	term &#147;honeycomb&#148; describes the shape of the pores inside of the scaffold as they are shaped like a honeycomb. The honeycomb structure is important because it allows cartilage cells to line up vertically throughout the scaffold so that they
	organize as they normally would in native cartilage. Competing scaffolds only accommodate cells on their surface or in layers. Our proprietary three-dimensional scaffolds can support and deliver a variety of cell types and are biocompatible,
	biodegradable and non-toxic.

	3 clinical trial that allowed us to generate additional Health Economics Outcomes Research data to provide additional support for our future reimbursement initiatives. These additional data include key economic data and outcomes associated with
	quality of life, productivity and return to work status, as well as healthcare resource utilization related to direct and indirect costs. We believe the recovery advantages of NeoCart over other treatments may be substantial, and expect these data

	We believe the strength of our regenerative medicine platform provides us
	with a significant opportunity to enhance and expand our product pipeline. In addition, we believe we can leverage our technology and reduce our manufacturing costs by using Intrexon&#146;s synthetic biology technology platform to develop and
	commercialize genetically modified chondrocyte cell therapeutics for the treatment or repair of damaged articular hyaline cartilage in humans. Initially we are focused on using Intrexon&#146;s technology to develop induced pluripotent stem cell
	derived (IPSC) source materials in our NeoCart manufacturing process and begin proof-of-concept testing in the first half of 2016. We also believe there is a significant unmet market need and commercial opportunity to treat cartilage defects in
	other joints such as ankles, shoulders and hips and intend to explore these areas both alone and in conjunction with Intrexon. Examples of such initiatives may include one-step, off-the&#150;shelf and/or next-generation NeoCart products as well as
	products designed to treat additional soft tissue and musculoskeletal-related disorders.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	NeoCart data produced as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 in the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials has demonstrated very favorable safety and the potential for durable

<I>
	Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery

	entitled &#147;Phase 2 Clinical Trial&#148; and &#147;Phase 1 Clinical Trial&#148; for a discussion of the data from our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. We consider the data observed thus far to be a direct result of NeoCart&#146;s distinct
	attributes that combine to form a sophisticated and unique biologic implant with evidence of cartilage growth prior to implantation and the ability to function like normal cartilage upon implantation. Further, we believe the data reflects that,
	after implantation, NeoCart continues to mature and integrate with the native cartilage as it is exposed to the natural environment of the joint. We believe these attributes and the clinical data we have accumulated to date differentiate NeoCart
	from other treatment alternatives, including microfracture.

	Phase 3 Clinical Trial
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are pursuing FDA approval via a BLA pathway with a clinical trial designed to show superiority against the current standard of care, microfracture. Our
	NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial is being performed under an SPA with the FDA and was initiated as a confirmatory study based on the promising safety and efficacy findings from our Phase 2 clinical trial. The Phase 3 clinical trial design, based on
	our Phase 2 clinical trial, is a prospective, controlled, multi-center trial of 245 adults between the ages of 18 and 59 years who have symptomatic focal full-thickness chondral knee defects randomized between NeoCart and microfracture on a
	two-to-one basis. Randomization is done at arthroscopy, at which time final patient eligibility is determined.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As agreed to with the FDA under our SPA,
	the primary endpoint for approval is superiority at one year in the proportion of responders in the NeoCart patient group compared to the proportion of responders in the microfracture patient group in a dual-threshold responder analysis. This unique
	dual-threshold responder analysis utilizes the KOOS pain subscale and IKDC Subjective assessments. Both the KOOS pain and the IKDC Subjective assessments are validated, patient-centered and self-administered outcome instruments intended to assess
	patient-relevant outcomes. The KOOS separately assesses and scores five dimensions of outcomes from the patient&#146;s perspective: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation function and knee-related quality of life.
	Similarly, the IKDC Subjective assesses and scores three dimensions of outcomes from the patient&#146;s perspective: symptoms, function during activities of daily living and sports.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The scores are tabulated and transformed to a 100-point scale, where 100 represents the best outcome for either pain or function and zero represents the worst
	outcome. A one-year superiority endpoint was deemed appropriate for our Phase 3 clinical trial under our SPA based on the magnitude of difference between the responder rates at one year for patients receiving NeoCart implants and patients receiving
	microfracture surgery in our Phase 2 clinical trial, a magnitude of difference that continued to be present through five years. We believe that, should our Phase 3 clinical trial show a comparable magnitude of difference in responder rates between
	NeoCart and microfracture, NeoCart&#146;s ability to function like cartilage upon implantation and integrate with the surrounding native tissue (attributes of NeoCart we believe are responsible for our Phase 2 clinical trial results) will be a
	principal reason for the one-year Phase 3 clinical trial outcome and the presumed resultant durability. However, there is no guarantee that our Phase 3 clinical trial results will demonstrate the same results as our Phase 2 or Phase 1 clinical
	trials and NeoCart may not be approved for sale in the United States by the FDA after the FDA reviews the results of the Phase 3 clinical trial.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we

	which could delay or otherwise adversely affect our clinical development activities. In November 2015, we filed an amendment to the to the NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial protocol under the SPA to expand the eligible patient population. In December
	2015, the FDA accepted the amendment which allows for, among other things, the inclusion of patients with trochlear lesions and the inclusion of patients up to age 59 into the trial. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had 32 sites eligible (out of a
	maximum of 40) to enroll patients.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In late 2009, pursuant to our SPA, we initiated our Phase 3 clinical trial and our first patient was randomized in
	June 2010. In September 2010, after nine patients had been randomized, active enrollment was postponed until the completion of a convertible debt financing in late 2011.

	In November 2012, we voluntarily suspended manufacturing operations and paused enrollment of the NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial upon discovery of
	discrepancies in the testing procedures used to assess one of the raw materials (bovine-derived type I collagen) utilized in the manufacture of NeoCart implants. All participating clinical trial sites, including Institutional Review Boards (IRB),
	and the FDA were notified of our decision. After an in-depth review of all available information, we concluded that the observed discrepancies did not impact product quality or patient safety, but we chose to continue our self-imposed pause to
	improve and upgrade certain of our existing manufacturing and quality control systems processes to meet or exceed cGMP standards. This transition was completed in December 2013. Prior to our November 2012 voluntary election to pause enrollment, 30
	patients had been randomized into the NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial. Twenty-one of these patients were randomized to receive a NeoCart implant and nine were randomized to undergo a microfracture procedure.

	Our NeoCart Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in 2007 to evaluate further the positive safety and early efficacy signals demonstrated in our Phase 1
	clinical trial of NeoCart for articular cartilage damage in the knee. We also sought to identify clinically meaningful endpoints and identify appropriate patient populations to be studied in the design of future clinical studies. The trial was a
	five-year prospective, controlled, randomized, clinical study of 30 patients conducted at six U.S. centers and completed its enrollment in 2008. Twenty-one patients were randomized to receive a NeoCart implant and nine patients were randomized to
	undergo a microfracture procedure. The trial was completed in 2013 with final data collection and analysis in 2014 and 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the Phase 2 clinical
	trial, baseline (preoperative) pain and function assessments were obtained and included, among other measurement instruments, the KOOS pain and symptoms subscales, the IKDC Subjective assessment and a visual analog pain scale. At every measurement
	interval between three months and three years, the same pain and function assessments were measured. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation), paired t testing and analysis of covariance with significance
	levels (p-values) set at less than 0.05 (two-sided). According to the results of the analysis, those patients receiving a NeoCart implant achieved statistically significant improvement (all p-values &lt;0.05) compared to their baseline assessments
	on the KOOS pain and symptoms subscales, the IKDC Subjective assessment and a visual analog pain scale, meaning that sufficient data exist to indicate the improvement on each measure is unlikely to have occurred by chance. Furthermore, when this
	improvement from baseline was compared to the improvement of microfracture from baseline, NeoCart&#146;s improvement was statistically significantly better (all p-values &lt;0.05) than microfracture&#146;s improvement on a meaningful number of the
	measurements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additional comparison of the two groups was performed with the previously described dual-threshold responder analysis we are utilizing in
	our Phase 3 clinical trial. To be considered a responder in the Phase 2 clinical trial, a patient must have achieved a minimum improvement on the KOOS pain subscale and the IKDC Subjective assessment compared to his or her baseline scores. The
	minimum required improvement for pain was 12 points and the minimum required improvement for function was 20 points.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The selected thresholds have been
	validated in the literature as clinically meaningful to patients. In some cases, patients entered the Phase 2 clinical trial with pain scores at a level such that they could not have improved a great deal (for example, a baseline of 91 points on a
	scale of 100). In those cases, patients were considered responders if their function scores improved a minimum of 20 points even if their pain scores did not improve the required 12 points. Compared to the microfracture group, NeoCart-treated
	patients had superior responses to treatment as early as three months in certain subscales with such responses lasting up to five years.

	As explained more fully above, some patients entered the Phase 2 clinical trial with minimal pain indicated by a high baseline KOOS pain score. A score of 100
	on the KOOS pain scale indicates the patient is reporting no pain. In those few cases, only the change in IKDC Subjective score was used to determine if the patients responded to therapy. In those cases, patients were deemed responders if their

	future peer-reviewed publication, which is expected in 2016. Based on the initial analysis, NeoCart generally demonstrated a lasting improvement over baseline through five years after implant. During the course of the trial, no serious adverse
	events (expected or unexpected) were considered to be product- or implant-related. We believe the data demonstrate the advantage of NeoCart relative to Microfracture through five years after surgery. Importantly, the difference in responders at the

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our manufacturing process for NeoCart is systematic and organized with specific steps that are tightly controlled. The first step includes receiving a biopsy
	from the patient&#146;s own cartilage from which cartilage cells can be isolated and expanded in number using segregated cell culture technology at our cGMP manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. Once we have achieved an adequate number
	of cartilage cells, these cartilage cells are placed into a sterile collagen solution provided to us in vials after sterile filtration by a third party contract manufacturer, and then applied to the three-dimensional collagen scaffold. The scaffold,
	which is currently provided to us by a third party supplier, provides an environment for the NeoCart implant to grow and develop into the form ultimately implanted. The development of the NeoCart implant occurs under controlled conditions in our in
	our TEP system which exposes the implant to pressure cycles designed to simulate the pressure cycles that cartilage is exposed to in the knee. After development in the TEP system, the implant is placed into a solution that allows further maturation
	prior to implantation. Once the implant is mature, it is shipped by a third-party to the clinical site for implantation in the patient, which typically occurs within three to five days after the completion of the manufacturing process. The
	manufacturing cycle time, from receipt of biopsy to delivery of the implant, is approximately six to nine weeks. The range in cycle time is dependent upon the variability in the growth rates of the cells obtained from individual patients.

	The quality control laboratory, located within our main Waltham, Massachusetts facility, handles cGMP release testing for the raw materials, CT3 components

	Manufacturing of raw materials and components used in the NeoCart supply chain is undergoing a technology transfer from outsourced contract manufacturers,
	which we used for clinical manufacturing, to our manufacturing facility in Lexington, Massachusetts, which we will use for commercial manufacturing in the event NeoCart is approved by the FDA. This technology transfer extends to the three components
	of the CT3 bioadhesive&#151;methylated collagen, curing solution and activated PEG&#151;and collagen honeycomb scaffold, which is used in the production of NeoCart. We also plan to transfer production of the collagen raw material used in some of the
	NeoCart components to our new facility. Sterile filtration and aseptic filling of our sterile collagen solution used in NeoCart production will continue to be performed by a third-party contract manufacturer. We do not anticipate changes to raw
	materials, components, formulations or properties, nor do we anticipate changes to the NeoCart manufacturing process or finished product specifications as a result of the transfer. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we completed the initial engineering
	runs and validation studies for the Lexington facility and also finished the last performance qualification manufacturing campaign for collagen. We intend to complete the manufacturing transition of the remaining raw materials including the scaffold

	In April 2001, we entered into a license agreement with The Board of Trustees of The Leland Stanford Junior University (Stanford) for patent rights relating to
	the restoration of articular cartilage. Our agreement with Stanford provides us with a worldwide license to make and sell products covered by claims of the licensed patents for growth, ontogenesis, and regeneration of cartilaginous tissues and

	sales of that year. We have paid $140,000 in yearly royalty fees through December&nbsp;31, 2015. Stanford is also entitled to a low single digit percentage rate of our net sales in royalties. We paid Stanford milestone payments of $35,000 upon
	issuance of the first licensed patent and $50,000 upon initiation of Phase 1 clinical trials of the licensed product in the first field that requires separate regulatory authority clinical approval. We have paid Stanford a milestone payment of
	$50,000 upon initiation of Phase 1 clinical trials of the licensed product in other fields that requires separate regulatory authority clinical approval, and are obligated to pay an additional milestone payment of $300,000 upon FDA marketing
	approval of the first licensed product.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The agreement terminates on the date that the last of the licensed patents expire, expected to be

	The competitive landscape in the field of articular cartilage repair is emerging and has stimulated a substantial amount of interest from companies developing
	tissue repair solutions. Companies have employed a variety of approaches to meet the goals of cartilage repair. The approaches, which represent the scientific evolution of the field, can be generally categorized in five ways:
	(1)&nbsp;non-cell-based, such as Arthrosurface&#146;s HemiCAP and Anika&#146;s Hyalofast; (2)&nbsp;uncultured cell-based (with or without scaffold), such as Zimmer&#146;s DeNovo NT, Arthrex&#146;s BioCartilage and Osiris&#146; Cartiform, distributed
	exclusively with Arthrex; (3)&nbsp;cultured cell-based (without scaffold), such as Vericel&#146;s Carticel and ISTO&#146;s RevaFlex; (4)&nbsp;cultured cell- and scaffold-based, such as Vericel&#146;s MACI and the Aesculap division of B. Braun
	Medical&#146;s NovoCart 3D; and (5)&nbsp;cultured cell- and scaffold-based incorporating tissue engineering, such as NeoCart.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For knee cartilage repair
	and regeneration, the market is large and growing, driven by more knee injuries in an increasingly active population. Worldwide, many products are commercially available, but the majority of these products are currently only available in the EEA,
	with Carticel, which was approved by the FDA in 1997, whose label restricts it for use in salvage cases, being the only cartilage repair product to gain U.S. approval through a regulated path to market. RevaFlex and NovoCart 3D are in U.S. clinical
	development, and based on our internal analysis of publicly available information, we believe may be approved in 2023 and 2020, respectively. However, their early clinical data have not been published in highly regarded peer-reviewed journals.
	Vericel&#146;s MACI has completed European clinical studies and, in January 2016, Vericel submitted a BLA for MACI to the FDA. If approved, MACI would likely be the second FDA approved product to treat cartilage defects in the knee. Although
	minimally-modified cells such as DeNovo NT, which launched in the United States in 2007, and acellular cartilage matrix products such as Cartiform and Arthrex&#146;s BioCartilage and are available in the United States, their path to market did not
	require a rigorous regulatory path and their clinical data to date has been sparse and commercial uptake limited. Product-less procedures such as debridement and microfracture continue to dominate the U.S. market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the
	future. Our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources that could put them at an advantage in the development of safe and efficacious products and may help them obtain regulatory approval for their products
	more rapidly, as well as achieve more widespread market acceptance. We believe, however, the competitive benefits of NeoCart will allow us to position NeoCart effectively as a strong contender in the tissue repair market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Outside the United States, many procedures and products for cartilage repair are available. However, we anticipate that many of these are unlikely to seek
	approval in the United States because of the rigorous and lengthy regulatory path a sponsor must pursue in order to access the market and the high-quality superiority data that must be produced. Additionally, other than the few currently approved
	U.S. products, to our knowledge no other known European cartilage product to date has any clinical experience or data in U.S. patients.

	The FDA does not apply a single regulatory scheme to human tissues and the products derived from human tissue. On a product-by-product basis, the FDA may
	regulate such products as drugs, biologics, or medical devices, in addition to regulating them as human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), depending on whether or not the particular product triggers any of an enumerated
	list of regulatory factors. A fundamental difference in the treatment of products under these classifications is that the FDA generally permits HCT/Ps that do not trigger any of those regulatory factors to be commercially distributed without
	marketing approval. In contrast, products that trigger those factors, such as if they are more than minimally manipulated when processed or manufactured, are regulated as drugs, biologics, or medical devices and require FDA approval. The FDA has
	designated NeoCart as a biologic under the jurisdiction of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and market access or approval will require BLA approval.

	: Analysis of recent trends in ACI coverage (discharge data) suggest that patients between 18 and 64 years of age constitute the
	majority of the market for ACI, resulting in a market dominated by private payors. Only 10% to 20% of ACI patients are estimated to be 65 years of age and older. While limited data is available for private payor reimbursement of ACI, these payors
	typically reimburse inpatient procedures with bundling mechanisms similar to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups. In addition, some private payors also tend to use Medicare rates as benchmarks when setting their own fee schedules. In
	preparation for the potential launch of NeoCart, if ever, we are developing a reimbursement dossier to facilitate the introduction of NeoCart into the marketplace. In November 2014, we submitted a protocol amendment to the FDA to augment additional
	Health Economics Outcomes Research data to further support our future reimbursement initiatives. These data would collect additional key economic data and outcomes associated with quality of life, productivity and return to work status, and
	healthcare resource utilization related to direct and indirect costs. Upon receipt of this data we plan to provide objective clinical data, patient-reported quality of life data and health economic data demonstrating NeoCart&#146;s value to assist

	Typically, if a biological product is intended to treat a chronic disease,
	as is the case with NeoCart, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical
	trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.

	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical
	characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of
	biological products, the Public Health Service Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of
	the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and
	stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

	In
	order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biological product
	for the proposed indication. The application includes all data available from nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the
	product&#146;s manufacture and composition, and proposed labeling, among other things. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if

	Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), each BLA must be accompanied by

	clinical data, such as a BLA, will be $2.2 million for 2014. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics ($104,060 for 2014), and an annual establishment fee ($554,600 for 2014) on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics.
	Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs,

	The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing
	based on the FDA&#146;s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may
	request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the BLA submission is accepted for filing,
	the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with
	GMPs to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency, and purity, and biological product standards. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult
	questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions.
	The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Before
	approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate
	to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTP. These are FDA regulations that
	govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP
	requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list
	their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance
	with IND application study requirements and GCP. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort. If the FDA determines the manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not
	acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will require the facility to take corrective action and provide documentation evidencing the implementation of such corrective action. This may significantly delay further review of
	the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the BLA
	and request additional testing or data. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a biological product
	outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the BLA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the BLA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include &#147;dear doctor
	letters,&#148; a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases restrictions on distribution. These elements are negotiated as part of the BLA approval, and in some cases may delay the approval date. Once adopted,
	REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After the FDA completes its initial review of a BLA, it will communicate to the sponsor that
	the biological product will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the BLA will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the
	BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions
	that the applicant might take to place the applicant in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the
	application.

	post-marketing clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product&#146;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, even after
	regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in the imposition of new restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure

	Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations

	assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the GMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. Other post-approval requirements applicable to
	biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy
	information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain
	tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary
	of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#146;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots

	As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex
	laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare &#147;fraud and abuse,&#148; including the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person,

	item for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from
	participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not
	just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and

	The False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal
	programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including biological products, that are false or fraudulent. Although we likely would not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if
	they are deemed to &#147;cause&#148; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the
	reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products and
	the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims
	Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare
	programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of,
	violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the False Claims Act and certain states have enacted

	government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In

	competent regulatory authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the EU Member States in which the clinical trials take place.

	Moreover,
	applicants are required to provide evidence that studies have been conducted with the medicinal product in the pediatric population as provided by a Pediatric Investigation Plan approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA. Alternatively,
	confirmation that the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral for the conduct of these studies must be provided. Cell-based products must also comply with Directive 2004/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of March&nbsp;31, 2004
	on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells (Tissues and Cells Directive). This Directive describes the conditions and quality
	requirements which must be applied when sourcing the cells intended for manufacturing of the cell-based medicinal product. The EU Member States have transposed the Tissues and Cells Directive into their national laws.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Locally different interpretations of the Tissue and Cells Directive have occurred during adoption of the national legal implementations by individual EU
	Member States. This has led to some inconsistency of approach leading to additional complexity in complying with the all-over requirements in this already difficult regulatory field.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Given the specific nature of cell-based products, the clinical development paths are less standardized than for classic pharmaceutical or biological products.
	Phase 1 studies are often not relevant, in particular for autologous cell-based products, since cells often need to be directly implanted into a tissue defect only present in patients. As cellular therapy Phase 3 studies are very complex to
	organize, often limited numbers of patients can be enrolled and follow up times can be very long, so that the design and execution of these large confirmatory trials might not always be possible to the classical extent. Upfront discussions and
	agreement with the regulatory authorities are an important criterion to success. It is also expected that new regulatory guidance will become available in the near future, more clearly describing the regulatory expectations.

	We currently produce materials for clinical trials, including
	production of NeoCart, at our existing manufacturing facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts, which we have designed and operated to be compliant with FDA, cGMP and the current Good Tissue Practice as and if applicable, requirements. While we believe
	these facilities provide us with sufficient capacity to meet our expected clinical demand and possibly our initial commercial launch demand, it is possible that the demand for products could exceed our existing manufacturing capacity. It will become
	necessary or desirable for us to expand our manufacturing capabilities for our regenerative medicine platform in the future, which may require us to invest significant amounts of capital and to obtain regulatory approvals. If we are unable to meet
	rising demand for products on a timely basis or unable to maintain cGMP compliance standards, then it is likely that our clients and potential clients will elect to obtain the products from competitors, which could materially and adversely affect
	the level of our revenues and our prospects for growth.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The current tissue engineering processor (TEP) in our Waltham facility is resource dependent due
	to the single-unit capacity. We are developing a multi-unit NeoCart reactor design which we believe would alleviate the capacity restraints currently resulting from our single-unit processors and expect to increase capacity to 2,500 units per year
	at the existing Waltham, Massachusetts facility. We currently expect to begin implementation of a multi-reactor unit during the first year of product commercialization, thus providing adequate capacity to meet expected demand through the first two
	years of commercialization from our Waltham facility. The FDA may not, however, approve implementation of the multi-unit NeoCart reactor or approval may be delayed which could result in capacity limitation or high unit costs depending upon the
	length of the delay. We are collaborating with a development corporation to design the multi-unit reactor.

	Components of regenerative medicine products

	In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to health care systems

	As a result of legislative proposals and the trend

	to provide coverage of approved product candidates for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse
	patients for their use of newly approved regenerative medicine products, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of such products. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the
	trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals as well as country, regional, or local healthcare budget limitations.

	We carry product liability insurance that we believe is sufficient in light of our current clinical programs;
	however, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to expand our
	insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action
	lawsuits based on regenerative medicine products or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. In addition, under some of our agreements with clinical trial sites, we are required to indemnify the sites and their personnel against
	product liability and other claims. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us or any third parties whom we are required to indemnify could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance
	coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.

	During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events for reasons

	approval to market our products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be
	time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our development and commercialization efforts, delay our regulatory approval process, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain.

	support approval for any of our product candidates. The final results of our current and future clinical trials may not meet the FDA&#146;s or other regulatory agencies&#146; requirements to approve a product candidate for marketing, and the
	regulatory agencies may otherwise determine that our manufacturing processes or facilities are insufficient to support approval. We may need to conduct more clinical trials than we currently anticipate. Even if we do receive FDA or other regulatory

	We will need to generate and provide the FDA with comparability data

	new critical raw material suppliers in our NeoCart trial. Additionally, the FDA may impose other requirements on the protocol for our NeoCart trial. These additional requirements may cause further delays in our NeoCart trial which could require us
	to incur additional development costs, seek funding for these increased costs or delay or cease our clinical development activities for NeoCart. Any inability to advance NeoCart or any other product candidate through clinical development would have
	a material adverse effect on our business. For example, the recently enacted Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act made permanent the Pediatric Research Equity Act, which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most
	tissue regeneration products for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, original NDAs and BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a
	pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and
	administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations, and it is likely that we will request such a
	deferral. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the tissue regeneration products is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to
	be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.

	attestation on our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&#146;s report

	Investors could find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions, which may make it more difficult for investors to compare
	our business with other companies in our industry. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, it may be
	difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. If we are unable to do so, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

	and ProChon Biotech Ltd. (ProChon) in Tel Aviv, Israel. We own 100% of the voting shares of ProChon. As the nature of the products, customers and methods to distribute products are the same and the nature of the regulatory environment, the

	On

	liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and
	stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about

	independent subject matter experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject

	Utilization of the net operating loss (NOL) and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to
	ownership change limitations that have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), as well as similar state and foreign provisions. These ownership changes may limit the
	amount of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an &#147;ownership change&#148; as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code results from
	a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50% of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. We have completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has
	occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our formation. The results of this study indicated we experienced ownership changes, as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, in each of 2006, 2011, 2012 and 2013. We have not
	recorded NOLs that as a result of these restrictions will expire unused. Accordingly, we have recorded NOL carryforwards net of these limitations, which are $3.9 million, $30.5 million, $36.7 million, $47.2 million, $47.2 million and $47.2 million

	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The new standard requires
	that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. We adopted this standard as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 with prospective application. As a result, we reclassified our deferred tax
	assets classified as current to noncurrent and our deferred tax liabilities classified as current to noncurrent in our December&nbsp;31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that eliminates the concept of a development stage entity in its entirety from
	GAAP. The guidance is intended to reduce the overall cost and complexity associated with financial reporting for development stage entities without reducing the availability of relevant information. The FASB also believes the changes will simplify
	the consolidation accounting guidance by removing the differential accounting requirements for development stage entities. As a result of these changes, there no longer will be any accounting or reporting differences in GAAP between development
	stage entities and other operating entities. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014. Early application is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the
	entity&#146;s financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). The adoption of this guidance as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 eliminated the disclosure of inception to date
	information from our consolidated financial statements.

	In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates diversity in practice surrounding the
	presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when an NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. An entity is required to net an unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset for an NOL carryforward, a similar tax
	loss, or a tax credit carryforward if the carryforward would be used to settle additional tax due upon disallowance of a tax position. The adoption of this guidance on January&nbsp;1, 2014 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
	statements.

	In November 2014, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate the existing diversity in practice in accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of
	a share. A hybrid financial instrument consists of a &#147;host contract&#148; into which one or more derivative terms have been embedded. This guidance requires an entity to consider the terms and features of the entire financial instrument,
	including the embedded derivative features, in order to determine whether the nature of the host contract is more akin to debt or to equity. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, with
	early adoption permitted. A reporting entity should apply this guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption. Retrospective application is
	permitted to all relevant prior periods. We do not expect that the application of this guidance will have an impact on the presentation of our results of operations, financial position or disclosures.

	In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on disclosure of uncertainties about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. This guidance addresses
	management&#146;s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December&nbsp;15, 2016 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect to adopt this guidance prior to the required date and believe the adoption of this guidance will not have material impact on

	interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015 with early adoption permitted using either of two methods: (i)&nbsp;prospective to all awards granted or modified after

	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance that affect any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into
	contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict
	the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
	beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. We have not had any revenue from contracts with customers through December&nbsp;31, 2015. Our adoption of this

	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
	effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The term &#147;disclosure controls and procedures,&#148; as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of
	a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
	SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
	Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#146;s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls
	and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
	procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
	effective at the reasonable assurance level.

	the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
	company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
	company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
	company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
	including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria established in
<I>
	Internal Control&#151;Integrated
	Framework (2013)
</I>
	&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31,
	2015 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurances and may not prevent or
	detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures
	may deteriorate.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fourth
	quarter of 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Control systems, no matter how well conceived and operated, are designed to provide a reasonable, but not an
	absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
	costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in any
	control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
	included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Histogenics Corporation
	(the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on June&nbsp;28, 2000 and has its principal operations in Waltham, Massachusetts. In 2006, the Company&#146;s board of directors approved a corporate
	reorganization pursuant to which the Company incorporated as a Delaware corporation. The Company is a regenerative medicine company engaged in developing and commercializing products in the musculoskeletal segment of the marketplace. The Company
	combines cell therapy and tissue engineering technologies to develop products for tissue repair and regeneration focusing on patients suffering from particular cartilage-derived pain and immobility. The Company is developing technology and products
	to reverse or prevent cartilage damage, including NeoCart for the repair of cartilage lesions. NeoCart is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States under a special protocol assessment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
	(&#147;FDA&#148;) for the treatment of knee cartilage damage.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On May&nbsp;13, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of ProChon Biotech Ltd.
	(&#147;ProChon&#148;), a privately-held biotechnology company focused on modulating the fibroblast growth factor system to enable it to create more effective solutions for tissue regeneration. ProChon&#146;s products combine cell regeneration
	technologies with proprietary growth factors and biocompatible scaffolds to restore injured or chronically damaged tissues to normal. The acquisition of ProChon provides the Company with access to a significant portfolio of intellectual property,
	including proprietary cell growth factors, in addition to furthering opportunities for the use of biomaterials to create more effective solutions for regenerating human tissue. In the aggregate, the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire
	ProChon was $2,224. The acquisition led to the initial recognition of goodwill, which was subsequently written off in 2011, and intangible assets including IPR&amp;D and a licensing agreement which have been impaired as discussed in Note 2.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to product development, recruiting management and technical
	staff, raising capital, starting up production and building infrastructure and has not generated revenues from its planned principal operations. Expenses have primarily been for research and development and administrative costs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company is subject to a number of risks. The developmental nature of its activities is such that significant inherent risks exist in the Company&#146;s
	operations. Principal among these risks are the successful development of therapeutics, successfully enrolling patients in our clinical trials in a timely manner, ability to obtain adequate financing, obtaining regulatory approval for any of our
	product candidates in any jurisdiction, compliance with government regulations, protection of proprietary therapeutics, fluctuations in operating results, dependence on key personnel and collaborative partners, adoption of the Company&#146;s
	products by the physician community, rapid technological changes inherent in the markets targeted, and substitute products and competition from larger companies.

	Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief
	operating decision-maker (&#147;CODM&#148;) or decision-making group in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company operates in two geographic regions: the United States (Massachusetts) and Israel (Tel Aviv)
	and views its operations as two operating segments: Histogenics Corporation (United States) and ProChon (Israel) as the CODM reviews separate discrete financial information in making decisions regarding resource allocations and assessing
	performance. Operating segments that have similar economic characteristics can be aggregated. As the nature of the products, customers, and methods to distribute products are the same and the nature of the regulatory environment, the production
	processes and historical and estimated future margins are similar, the two operating segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment as they have similar economic characteristics.

	Fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or
	liability and is based on a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (observable inputs) and the lowest priority
	to the Company&#146;s assumptions (unobservable inputs). Fair value measurements should be disclosed separately by level within the fair value hierarchy. For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, it is the Company&#146;s policy to maximize
	the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance with established fair value hierarchy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there exists limited or no observable market data are based primarily upon estimates, and often are
	calculated based on the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate
	settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any valuation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect
	the results of current or future values.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a
	nonrecurring basis, such as assets held for sale and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), and the lowest priority to
	unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company&#146;s financial assets are classified within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of inputs that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy,
	and its applicability to the Company&#146;s financial assets, are described below.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 3 valuations are for instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions and may be adjusted to reflect
	illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management&#146;s best estimate is used. There were no Level 3 financial assets at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and
	2014.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An adjustment to the pricing method used within either Level 1 or Level 2 inputs could generate a fair value measurement that effectively falls in
	a lower level in the hierarchy. The Company had no assets or liabilities classified as Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 other than the money market fund described in the &#147;Cash and Cash Equivalents&#148; section

	Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. When impairment indicators exist, the Company&#146;s
	management evaluates long-lived assets for potential impairment. An impairment loss is recorded if and when events and circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are
	less than the carrying amount of those assets. While the Company&#146;s current and historical operating losses and negative cash flows are indicators of impairment, management believes that future cash flows to be received support the carrying
	value of its long-lived assets.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company&#146;s intangible asset consists of acquired in-process research and development (&#147;IPR&amp;D&#148;)
	obtained through the acquisition of ProChon. IPR&amp;D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that have not been completed at the date of acquisition. The value assigned to acquired IPR&amp;D is determined by
	estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting revenue from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to present value. The revenue and costs projections used to value
	acquired IPR&amp;D were adjusted based on the probability of success of developing a new product. Additionally, the projections considered the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing
	of new product introductions by the Company and its competitors. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were commensurate with the stage of development of the projects and uncertainties in the economic estimates
	used in the projections described above.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	IPR&amp;D is considered an indefinite-lived intangible asset and is assessed for impairment annually or more
	frequently if impairment indicators exist. When performing the impairment assessment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to recalculate the fair value of its acquired IPR&amp;D. If the Company
	believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of acquired IPR&amp;D is less than its carrying amount, it calculates the fair value using the same

	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 using an income approach, including a discount rate of 13%, applied to probability-adjusted after-tax cash flows. The Company believes that the assumptions are representative of those a market participant would use in
	estimating the fair value of the IPR&amp;D. The Company notes that the pursuit of the underlying IPR&amp;D has been delayed because the Company&#146;s core focus has been on the development of NeoCart so, there is a risk of further impairment in the
	near future.

	The Company accounts for grants of stock options and restricted stock based on their grant date fair value and recognizes compensation expense over their
	vesting period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and restricted stock based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as determined by management or the
	value of the services provided, whichever is more readily determinable.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Stock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value
	of employee stock option grants recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is adjusted for actual forfeitures at year end. Stock-based
	compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.

	For stock option grants
	with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. For stock option grants with both
	performance-based milestones and market conditions, expense is recorded over the derived service period after the point when the achievement of the performance-based milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. The Company
	did not issue any performance-based awards with market conditions from its inception through December&nbsp;31, 2014. The Company issued performance-based awards in 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
	expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of
	assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes
	the enactment date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes these assets are more likely than not to be
	realized. In making such a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results
	of recent operations. If management determines that the Company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future, in excess of its net recorded amount, management would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance,
	which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby
	(1)&nbsp;management determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2)&nbsp;for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition
	threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
	benefits within income tax expense. Any accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Earnings (loss) per common share is calculated using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings (loss) per
	share for the holders of the Company&#146;s common shares and participating securities. All series of preferred stock contain participation rights in any dividend paid by the Company and are deemed to be participating securities. Earnings available
	to common stockholders and participating convertible redeemable preferred shares are allocated to each share on an as-converted basis as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. The participating securities do not include a
	contractual obligation to share in losses of the Company and are not included in the calculation of net loss per share in the periods that have a net loss.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the more dilutive of (a)&nbsp;the two-class method, or (b)&nbsp;the if-converted method. The Company allocates
	earnings first to preferred stockholders based on dividend rights and then to common and preferred stockholders based on ownership interests. The weighted-average number of common shares included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) gives
	effect to all potentially dilutive common equivalent shares, including outstanding stock options, warrants, convertible redeemable preferred stock and the potential issuance of stock upon the conversion of the Company&#146;s convertible notes.
	Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share if their effect is antidilutive.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The new standard requires
	that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The Company prospectively adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in the removal of gross deferred tax
	assets and liabilities from the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet. The net impact was zero and the prior period was not retrospectively adjusted.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the concept of a development stage entity in its entirety from GAAP. The guidance is intended to reduce
	the overall cost and complexity associated with financial reporting for development stage entities without reducing the availability of relevant information. The Board also believes the changes will simplify the consolidation accounting guidance by
	removing the differential accounting requirements for development stage entities. As a result of these changes, there no longer will be any accounting or reporting differences in GAAP between development stage entities and other operating entities.
	The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014. Early application is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity&#146;s financial statements have not yet been
	issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). The Company&#146;s adoption of this guidance as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 eliminated the disclosure of inception to date information from the Company&#146;s
	consolidated financial statements.

	In November 2014, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate the existing diversity in practice in accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of
	a share. A hybrid financial instrument consists of a &#147;host contract&#148; into which one or more derivative terms have been embedded. This guidance requires an entity to consider the terms and features of the entire financial instrument,
	including the embedded derivative features, in order to determine whether the nature of the host contract is more akin to debt or to equity. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, with
	early adoption permitted. A reporting entity should apply this guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption. Retrospective application is
	permitted to all relevant prior periods. The Company does not expect that the application of this guidance will have an impact on the presentation of its results of operations, financial position or disclosures.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires management to assess an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern every reporting period,
	and provide certain disclosures if management has substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to operate as a going concern, or an express statement if not, by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S.
	auditing standards. This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an
	impact on the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring when there is a performance
	target that affects vesting of equity awards granted and could be achieved after the requisite service period to be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance on stock-based compensation, as it relates to
	such awards. This guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015 with early adoption permitted using either of two methods: (i)&nbsp;prospective to all awards granted
	or modified after the effective date; or (ii)&nbsp;retrospective to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new

	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance that affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services
	or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize
	revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments are effective for annual
	reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The Company has not had any revenue from contracts with customers from its inception through
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. The Company&#146;s adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

	The necessary conditions were met upon the closing of the Company&#146;s IPO on December&nbsp;8, 2014
	resulting in the net exercise of warrants into 44,531 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock and settlement of the Other Liability through the transfer of shares from the Company&#146;s investors. The closing of the Company&#146;s IPO also
	resulted in the conversion of the Company&#146;s redeemable preferred stock and dividends into 5,158,407 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. The table above does not include the preferred stock and warrants of 4,558,483 and 47,898 that were

	In March 2015, in connection with a consulting agreement entered into for an
	interim chief financial officer, the Company issued a common stock warrant as compensation to the consulting firm. The warrant provides the holder with the right to purchase an aggregate of 7,398 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at a per
	share exercise price of $9.75, the closing price of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of issuance. The warrant vests and becomes exercisable in monthly installments over 24 months beginning March&nbsp;31, 2015. The warrant expires on the
	tenth anniversary of issuance. The warrant is equity classified and accounted for using the fair value approach. The fair value of the warrant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is subject to re-measurement at each
	reporting period until the measurement date is reached. On December&nbsp;21, 2015 the Company terminated the consulting agreement resulting in the forfeiture of 50% (3,699)&nbsp;of the shares. The remaining 3,699 shares are vested and exercisable on
	December&nbsp;31, 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company issued equity-classified warrants on July&nbsp;20, 2012 and July&nbsp;9, 2014 which are immediately exercisable into
	161,977 and 6,566 shares of common stock. The warrants issued on July&nbsp;20, 2012 are included in the table above for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, as they would be anti-dilutive for that period. Of the warrants issued on July&nbsp;20,
	2012, 5,839 of the warrant shares were surrendered on December&nbsp;3, 2014 when the Company completed its IPO The remaining 156,138 warrants issued on July&nbsp;20, 2012 remained outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 along with the warrants
	issued on July&nbsp;9, 2014 which both are included in the table above for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 as they would be anti-dilutive for the period. See Note 10,

	the right to the 2% net sales distribution payment) and recorded at their fair value of $42,617 or $16.10 per share. The 955,568 shares of Series A-1 Preferred were recorded at their fair value of $14,454 or $15.13 per share. The redemption feature
	relating to the new 3% net sales distribution payment was initially accounted for as a freestanding financial instrument, was recorded at its fair value of $13,100 as a long-term liability in 2014. As part of the extinguishment, the Company recorded

	less than the estimated fair value of such stock on the date of grant. Stock options generally vest 25% on the first anniversary of the original vesting date, with the balance vesting monthly over the remaining three years, unless they contain
	specific performance and/or market-based vesting provisions. The maximum term of stock options granted under the 2013 Plan is ten years. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan will be increased automatically on the first
	business day of each of our fiscal years during the term of the 2013 Plan, commencing in 2015, by a number equal to the lowest of: (a)&nbsp;181,414 shares of common stock; (b)&nbsp;3.5% of the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding
	on December&nbsp;31 of the prior year; or (c)&nbsp;the number of shares determined by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;EIP Evergreen Provision&#148;). To the extent any awards under the 2013 Plan are forfeited, terminate, expire,
	lapse without the issuance of shares, or if the Company repurchases shares subject to awards under the 2013 Plan, those shares will again become available for issuance under the 2013 Plan. Accordingly, the number of shares of common stock available
	for issuance under the EIP was increased by 181,414 shares effective January 1, 2016.

	2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s board of directors adopted the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#147;2013 ESPP&#148;) in November 2013 which the stockholders approved in
	October 2014. The 2013 ESPP became effective upon the closing of the IPO on December&nbsp;3, 2014. The Company&#146;s 2013 ESPP qualifies under Section&nbsp;423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 2013 ESPP, 103,665 shares of the Company&#146;s
	common stock are authorized for issuance to eligible employees. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2013 ESPP will automatically be increased on the first business day of each of the Company&#146;s fiscal years, commencing in 2015,
	by a number equal to the lowest of 51,832 shares of common stock; 1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal year; or the number of shares determined by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors (the
	&#147;EIP Evergreen Provision&#148;). On January&nbsp;16, 2015, the Company increased the authorized shares by 51,832, for a total of 155,497 share of the Company&#146;s common stock authorized for issuance to eligible employees under the 2013 ESPP.
	The number of shares reserved under the 2013 ESPP will automatically be adjusted in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or a reverse stock split (including an adjustment to the per-purchase period share limit). The Company&#146;s 2013 ESPP
	permits each eligible employee to purchase common stock through payroll deductions. No activity under the Plan in 2015 and 2014.

	The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, based on the Company&#146;s history of operating losses, the Company has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the benefit of its deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, the Company has
	provided a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. The valuation allowance increased $11,785 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, due primarily to net operating losses generated and
	capitalized expenses. The valuation allowance increased by $7,710 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, due primarily to net operating losses generated and capitalized expenses.

	During November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, &#147;Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes&#148;, which simplifies the presentation of deferred
	income taxes. This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a statement of financial position. We early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective December&nbsp;31, 2015 on a prospective basis. Adoption of this ASU
	resulted in the removal of gross deferred tax assets and liabilities from the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December&nbsp;31, 2015. The impact was zero. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted. The Company had recorded a
	current net deferred tax liability of $651 and a noncurrent net deferred tax asset of $651 as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. The classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily related to the timing of the reversal of the deferred tax
	liability related to a change of accounting method in 2013.

	Utilization of the NOL and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial
	annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section&nbsp;382 and Section&nbsp;383 of the Code, as well as similar state and foreign provisions. These ownership changes
	may limit the amount of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an &#147;ownership change&#148; as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code
	results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. The Company has completed a study to
	assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since its formation. The results of this study indicated that the Company experienced ownership changes as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code.
	The Company has not recorded NOLs that, as a result of these restrictions, will expire unused. Accordingly, the Company has recorded NOL carryforwards net of these limitations, which are approximately $47,170 in 2014 and 2015.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $687 and $811, respectively. The
	uncertain tax positions giving rise to the unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to methods of accounting, used in the Company&#146;s tax returns, which accelerated certain deductions for federal income tax purposes. The reversal of the
	unrecognized tax benefits would not have any impact on effective tax rates in future periods and are not expected to create cash tax liabilities upon settlement due to the Company&#146;s ability to utilize both pre-change and post-change NOLs. The
	Company believes that it is reasonably possible that $124 of its unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2016.
