	This annual report contains translations of certain Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at
	specified rates. Unless otherwise stated, the translation of Renminbi into U.S. dollars has been made at RMB6.6459 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect on June&nbsp;30, 2016 as set forth in the H.10 Statistical Release of the Federal Reserve
	Board. We make no representation that any Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate, the rates stated below, or at all. The PRC government
	imposes controls over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of Renminbi into foreign exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade. On October 21, 2016, the noon buying rate was RMB6.7654 to US$1.00.

	We conduct substantially all of our operations in China. All of our revenue, costs and expenses of our operation companies are denominated in
	Renminbi. This annual report contains translations of certain Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates. Unless otherwise stated, the translation of Renminbi into U.S. dollars has been made at RMB6.6459 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate
	in effect on June&nbsp;30, 2016 as set forth in the H.10 Statistical Release of the Federal Reserve Board. We make no representation that any Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as
	the case may be, at any particular rate, the rates stated below, or at all. The PRC government imposes controls over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of Renminbi into foreign exchange and through
	restrictions on foreign trade. On October&nbsp;21, 2016, the noon buying rate was RMB6.7654 to US$1.00.

	One of the principal drivers of the growth of our international
	program is the increasing number of Chinese students who choose to study abroad, especially in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, reflecting the growing demand for higher education in overseas countries by Chinese students. As such,
	any restrictive changes in immigration policy, terrorist attacks, geopolitical uncertainties and any international conflicts involving these countries could increase the difficulty for Chinese students to obtain student visas to study overseas, or
	decrease the appeal of studying in such countries to Chinese students. Any significant change in admission standards adopted by overseas educational institutions could also affect the demand for overseas education by Chinese students. If overseas
	educational institutions significantly reduce their reliance on or acceptance of admission and assessment tests, such as TOEFL, IELTS or the Scholastic Assessment Test, or the SAT, the difficulty for Chinese students to meet the new admission
	standards could significantly increase, which could in turn negatively affect the demand for overseas education by Chinese students. Additionally, Chinese students may also become less attracted to studying abroad due to other reasons, such as
	improving domestic educational or employment opportunities associated with increased economic development in China. These factors could cause declines in the demand for our international program, which may adversely affect our revenue and

	The regulatory authorities in China, at both the national and local levels, have broad powers to regulate the tuition, accommodation and other
	fees charged by K-12 schools as well as the student enrollment levels at these schools. As a result, new regulations could adversely impact the tuition, accommodation and other fees we may charge for our school programs and the level of student
	enrollment at our schools. In particular, the regulatory authorities impose a maximum ceiling on the amount of tuition we can charge. For example, the most recent ceiling on the amount of tuition and boarding expenses we can charge was set out by
	the Zhuji branch of the Ministry of Education, or the MOE, in November 2012, which sets forth the maximum amounts of tuition and boarding expenses for primary school, middle school and high school as RMB31,000 per student, RMB33,000 per student and
	RMB35,000 per student, respectively. In the 2013/2014 school year, we charged an average tuition per student for the primary school, middle school and high school education under our basic educational program of RMB24,812, RMB23,269 and RMB26,509,
	respectively. In addition, pursuant to the registration documents filed with local authorities for the 2013/2014 school year, we reported to the regulatory authority that we would charge RMB50,000 to RMB60,000 per student for our international
	program. In the 2014/2015 school year, we charged an average tuition per student for the primary school, middle school and high school education under our basic educational program of RMB25,354, RMB23,723 and RMB25,683. In addition, pursuant to the
	registration documents filed with local authorities for the 2014/2015 school year, we reported to the regulatory authority that we would charge RMB50,000 to RMB60,000 per student for our international program. In the 2015/2016 school year, we
	charged an average tuition per student for the primary school, middle school and high school education under our basic educational program of RMB33,309, RMB30,852 and RMB31,864. There is currently no maximum amount set for our kindergarten or
	international program. See &#147;Item 4. Information on the Company&#151;B. Business Overview&#151;Regulations&#151;Regulations on Private Education&#151;The Law for Promoting Private Education (2003)&nbsp;and the Implementation Rules for the Law
	for Promoting Private Education (2004).&#148; In addition, the Zhejiang provincial government has set a maximum number of high school students we can admit from cities other than Zhuji in Zhejiang province to our basic educational program, after
	consultation with us. In the 2015/2016 school year, the maximum number of such high school students was set at 2,280 for Zhuji Private High School and 1,000 for Tianma Experimental School. We generally recruit students at the maximum level set by
	the government in Zhejiang province and additional students from other provinces. We may not admit more than the number that is approved by the regulatory authority. There is currently no limit as to the number of students we may admit for our
	kindergarten and international program. In light of the significant increase in tuition and other education-related fees in recent years, regulatory authorities may impose stricter price control on educational charges in the future. As part of their
	efforts to regulate the private education industry, they may also impose stricter student annual enrollment quotas. If the fees were to decrease or were not allowed to increase in line with increases in our costs, or if student enrollment at our

	Our future is highly dependent upon the acceptance, development and expansion of the market for private
	for-profit K-12 educational services in China. The private for-profit K-12 educational services market started to develop in the early 1990s and has grown significantly due to favorable policies enacted by the Chinese government. Zhuji Hailiang
	Foreign Language School, our first private K-12 school, was established in 1995. In 1997, the State Council of the PRC promulgated the first regulation to promote the private education industry in China. However, private educational services on a
	for-profit basis were not permitted in China until 2003 when the Law of the People&#146;s Republic of China on the Promotion of Privately-run Schools became effective. Our three schools, namely Zhuji Hailiang Foreign Language School, Zhuji Private
	High School and Tianma Experimental School, are among the earliest private schools in China to operate on a for-profit basis.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	development of this market has been accompanied by significant press coverage and public debate concerning the management and operation of private for-profit schools. Significant uncertainty remains in China as to public acceptance of this business
	model. In addition, there is significant uncertainty relating to the application and interpretation of PRC law as it relates to the promotion of the private for-profit education industry. For example, certain favorable policies referenced in PRC law
	are available to private schools, such as preferential tax treatment. To date, however, no separate policies, regulations or rules have been introduced by the authorities in this regard. If this business model fails to gain wide acceptance among the
	general public, especially among students and their parents, or if the favorable regulatory environment otherwise changes in the future, we may be unable to grow our business and the market price of our ADSs could be materially and adversely

	One of our growth strategies is to continue to maintain and introduce diversified educational programs. We may also need, from time to time,

	For example, a significant part of our educational services focuses on middle school and high
	school education. There are continual changes in the focuses of the subjects and questions tested on standardized tests, such as the Zhongkao and the Gaokao, the two most significant tests for Chinese students. These tests are administered by local
	government authorities and are critical in determining admission into high school, in the case of the Zhongkao, and college, in the case of the Gaokao. The format of these tests and the manner in which such standardized tests are administered are
	also changing, especially in Zhejiang province, one of the pioneers in educational reform and innovation. In particular, in 2009, Zhejiang Province implemented its new Gaokao regime, where two new types of evaluations, namely the High School
	Graduation Exam and the Comprehensive Quality Evaluation, were incorporated into the undergraduate admission process. The new regime also allowed universities to use their self-designed tests, as opposed to the standard tests designed by the
	government, in their admission process. In addition, on a national level, some top universities in China, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, have been allowed to recruit a certain percentage of students through independently
	administered tests and admission procedures in recent years. While college applicants are still required to have a Gaokao score above a certain threshold, the Gaokao scores for these applicants will not be the sole determining factor in the
	admission process. In 2009, 76 universities and colleges were allowed to recruit students through independently administered tests and admission procedures according to a notice promulgated by the MOE on December&nbsp;12, 2008. The number of such
	universities and colleges in 2016 is 90.

	These changes require us to continually update and enhance our curriculum, educational materials
	and our teaching methods. Any inability to track and respond to changes in the educational field in a timely and cost-effective manner would make our educational services and programs less attractive to students, which may materially and adversely
	affect our students&#146; academic performance, our reputation and ability to continue to attract and retain students. Furthermore, we understand that PRC regulatory authorities have reformed and may continue to reform the K-12 curriculum we are
	required to teach at our schools. Therefore, school curriculum will likely undergo changes and our services, programs and educational materials will need to adapt to such changes.

	firm identified two material weaknesses as defined in the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Standard AU Section&nbsp;325, Communicating Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an Audit, or AU325, in our internal control over
	financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2015. We are required, beginning this fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
	each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of these controls in our Annual Report on Form 20-F. Based on its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, including the
	information made available to management regarding the results of our review of our corporate governance policies and procedures, similar but fewer material weaknesses were identified in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial
	statements as of and for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2016. As a result, our management determined that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016. The material
	weakness identified related to insufficient resources for financial information processing and reporting and lack of appropriate IFRS knowledge. Because the material weakness identified&nbsp;by our management requires significant financial resources
	and management&#146;s time to address, we may continue to experience this material weakness in the foreseeable future. Following the identification of the material weakness and other control deficiencies, we have taken some measures and plan to
	continue to take all necessary measures to remedy these deficiencies. See &#147;Item 15. Controls and Procedures&#151;Internal Control over Financial Reporting,&#148; for a description of this material weakness and additional information about
	management&#146;s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. However, although we have carried out some measures to address these deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of these measures
	has not fully address these deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to remediate the deficiencies identified in our evaluation or that we will not identify
	additional deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future. We will need to incur additional costs and use management and other resources in order to comply with Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our failure to correct these control
	deficiencies or our failure to discover and address any other control deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related
	regulatory filings on a timely basis. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ADSs, may be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, ineffective internal control
	over financial reporting significantly hinders our ability to prevent fraud. The absence of effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures increases the risk that we have not, or may in the future not,
	file our financial statements and related reports with the SEC on a timely basis, that there may be errors in our financial statements or material misstatements or omissions in our related reports and documents filed with the SEC. The occurrence of
	any of these events could expose us to private litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions and undermine investor confidence in our reported financial information. The resolution of any such matters, should they arise, may
	be time consuming and expensive and may distract management from the conduct of our business. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions, we could be required to pay
	damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. This could adversely impact the market price of our ADSs due to a loss of investor confidence in the
	reliability of our reporting processes.

	concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal

	During the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy

	While we believe that we have

	inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate. We cannot be certain in future periods that one or more material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal
	control over financial reporting will not be identified. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing required new or improved controls, our business and results of

	On January&nbsp;19, 2015, MOFCOM published a draft of the PRC Law on Foreign Investment (Draft for Comment), or the Foreign Investment Law,
	which is open for public comments until February&nbsp;17, 2015. At the same time, MOFCOM published an accompanying explanatory note of the draft Foreign Investment Law, or the Explanatory Note, which contains important information about the draft
	Foreign Investment Law, including its drafting philosophy and principles, main content, plans to transition to the new legal regime and treatment of business in China controlled by&nbsp;foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, primarily through
	contractual arrangements. The draft Foreign Investment Law is intended to replace the current foreign investment legal regime consisting of three laws: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture
	Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law, as well as detailed implementing rules. The draft Foreign Investment Law proposes significant changes to the PRC foreign investment legal regime and may have a material impact on Chinese
	companies listed or to be listed overseas. The proposed Foreign Investment Law is to regulate FIEs the same way as PRC domestic entities, except for those FIEs that operate in industries deemed to be either &#147;restricted&#148; or
	&#147;prohibited&#148; in a &#147;Negative List.&#148; Because the Negative List has yet to be published, it is unclear whether it will differ from the current list of industries subject to restrictions or prohibitions on foreign investment
	(including our industry). The draft Foreign Investment Law also provides that only FIEs operating in industries on the Negative List will require entry clearance and other approvals that are not required of PRC domestic entities. As a result of the
	entry clearance and approvals, certain FIEs operating in industries on the Negative List may not be able to continue to conduct their operations through contractual arrangements.

	The specifics of the draft Foreign Investment Law&#146;s application to variable entity structures have yet to be proposed, but it is
	anticipated that the draft Foreign Investment Law will regulate variable interest entities. MOFCOM suggests both registration and approval as potential options for the regulation of variable entity structures, depending on whether they are
	&#147;Chinese&#148; or &#147;foreign-controlled.&#148; One of the core concepts of the draft Foreign Investment Law is &#147;de facto control,&#148; which emphasizes substance over form in determining whether an entity is &#147;Chinese&#148; or
	&#147;foreign-controlled&#148;. This determination requires considering the nature of the investors that exercise control over the entity. &#147;Chinese investors&#148; are natural persons who are Chinese nationals, Chinese government agencies and
	any domestic enterprise controlled by Chinese nationals or government agencies. &#147;Foreign investors&#148; are foreign citizens, foreign governments, international organizations and entities controlled by foreign citizens and entities. We are
	majority controlled by Mr.&nbsp;Feng, a PRC national; therefore, it increases the likelihood that our company may be deemed &#147;Chinese&#148; controlled. In its current form, the draft Foreign Investment Law will make it difficult for foreign
	financial investors, including private equity and venture capital firms, to obtain a controlling interest of a Chinese enterprise in a foreign restricted industry. However, under the proposed new law, we may no longer need to hold interests in our
	schools through contractual arrangements and may be able to have control through direct equity ownership.

	There is substantial
	uncertainty regarding the draft Foreign Investment Law, including, among others, what the actual content of the law will be as well as the adoption timeline or effective date of the final form of the law. While such uncertainty exists, we cannot
	determine whether the new foreign investment law, when it is adopted and becomes effective, will not have a material positive or negative impact on our corporate structure and business.

	In addition, on August&nbsp;29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular 142, a notice regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of its
	capital contribution in foreign currency into Renminbi. The notice requires that the capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies shall be used only for purposes within the business scope as approved by
	the applicable governmental authorities. Such loan may not be used for equity investments within the PRC unless such activity is set forth in the business scope or is otherwise permissible under PRC laws or regulations. In addition, SAFE
	strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of such capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be changed without SAFE&#146;s approval, and may not in any
	case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not otherwise been used. Violations of Circular 142 will result in severe penalties including heavy fines. In order to further reform the foreign exchange administration system,
	SAFE issued the Circular on Reform of Administration Model of the Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises on March&nbsp;30, 2015, or Circular 19, which took effect from June&nbsp;1, 2015 and replaced the SAFE Circular
	142. Circular 19 allows foreign invested enterprises to settle their foreign exchange capital on a discretionary basis according to the actual needs of their business operations and provides procedures by which a foreign-invested company may convert
	and use equity investments made in foreign currencies. Circular 19 also reiterates, however, the principle that Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may not be used, either directly or
	indirectly, for purposes beyond its business scope. Since Circular 19 was just promulgated, there are uncertainties as to how it will be interpreted and implemented in practice.

	The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects. Although the PRC economy has been transitioning from
	a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy since the late 1970s, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating the industry. The PRC government continues to exercise significant control over China&#146;s economic
	growth through allocating resources, controlling the incurrence and payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Changes in any of these
	policies, laws and regulations could adversely affect the economy in China or the market for educational services, which could harm our business.

	fair market value, the competent tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction. Circular 698 is retroactively effective from January&nbsp;1, 2008. There is uncertainty as to the application of
	Circular 698. For example, while the term &#147;Indirect Transfer&#148; is not clearly defined, it is understood that the relevant PRC tax authorities have jurisdiction regarding requests for information over a wide range of foreign entities having
	no direct contact with China. Moreover, the relevant authority has not yet promulgated any formal provisions or formally declared or stated how to calculate the effective tax rates in foreign tax jurisdictions, and the process and format of the
	reporting of an Indirect Transfer to the competent tax authority of the relevant PRC resident enterprise remain unclear. In addition, there are not formal declarations with regard to how to determine whether a foreign investor has adopted an abusive
	arrangement in order to reduce, avoid or defer PRC tax. As a result, we and our non-resident investors may have the risk of being taxed under Circular 698 and may be required to spend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 or to establish
	that we or our non-resident investors should not be taxed under Circular 698, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or such non-resident investors&#146; investments in us.

	The change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, various factors, such as changes in
	China&#146;s political and economic conditions. On July&nbsp;21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under such policy, the Renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a
	narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Later on, the People&#146;s Bank of China has decided to further implement the reform of the RMB exchange regime and to enhance the flexibility of RMB exchange rates. Such
	changes in policy have resulted in a significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar since 2005 though there have been periods when the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the Renminbi as well. There remains significant
	international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant adjustment of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.

	SAFE, jointly issued the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&amp;A Rules. This regulation, among other things, requires that the listing and trading on an overseas stock exchange of
	securities in an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for purposes of holding direct or indirect equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals be approved by the CSRC. On
	September&nbsp;21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website the procedures for such approval process. In particular, certain documents are required to be filed with the CSRC as part of the approval procedures and it could take several months

	While the implementation and interpretation of the M&amp;A Rules remains unclear, we believe, based on
	the advice of our PRC counsel, that approval by the CSRC was not required for our initial public offering because we are not a special purpose vehicle formed or controlled by PRC companies or PRC individuals as defined under the M&amp;A Rules.
	However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC regulatory authorities, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as our PRC counsel. If the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authority subsequently determines that we needed to obtain the
	CSRC&#146;s approval for our initial public offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory authorities. In such event, these regulatory authorities may, among other things, impose fines and penalties on or otherwise restrict our
	operations in the PRC or delay or restrict any remittance of the proceeds from our initial public offering into the PRC. Any such or other actions taken could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
	operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ADSs.

	SAFE Circular No.&nbsp;75 before SAFE Circular No.&nbsp;37 went into effect. However, SAFE Circular No.&nbsp;37 shall apply to any subsequent amendments made by Mr.&nbsp;Feng after the effective date of SAFE Circular No.&nbsp;37. As of the date of

	We started our operations in 1995 when Zhuji Hailiang Foreign Language School, our first private school, was founded by Mr.&nbsp;Feng. Our
	second private school, namely Zhuji Private High School, was founded by Mr.&nbsp;Feng and Mr.&nbsp;Zhanghuan Meng, or Mr.&nbsp;Meng, in 2001. At the time of its founding, Mr.&nbsp;Feng owned 60% of the equity interest in the school and Mr.&nbsp;Meng
	held the remaining equity interest in the school. In November 2011, Mr.&nbsp;Feng purchased the remaining 40% equity interest in Zhuji Private High School from Mr.&nbsp;Meng and became the sole sponsor of Zhuji Private High School. Our third private
	school, namely Tianma Experimental School, was jointly acquired by Mr.&nbsp;Feng and Mr.&nbsp;Meng in July 2009. At the same time of the acquisition, Mr.&nbsp;Feng and Mr.&nbsp;Meng beneficially owned 80% and 20% of the equity interest in the
	school, respectively. In November 2011, Mr.&nbsp;Feng acquired the 20% equity interest in the school from Mr.&nbsp;Meng and became the sole sponsor of Tianma Experimental School. Mr.&nbsp;Meng disposed of his equity interest in Zhuji Private High
	School and Tianma Experimental School in order to raise capital for and pursue other business opportunities. As a result, Mr.&nbsp;Feng owned 100% of the equity interest in each of our three schools.

	We offer our basic educational program and international program at the kindergarten, primary
	school, middle school and high school levels. Our basic educational program offers curricula with courses mandated by the PRC regulatory authorities, as well as those developed through our own research and development efforts. Our international
	program also offers curricula mandated by the PRC regulatory authorities and in addition, provides curricula with a focus on preparing students to study abroad. As most of the students in our international program plan to study abroad after they
	graduate from our middle school and high school programs, we have designed our international program to specifically address the needs of these students in terms of both language and academics. In addition, for students planning to apply to
	undergraduate programs in the U.S. and the U.K., we provide courses designed to help students become admitted to these programs, such as A-levels courses for U.K. universities and SAT courses for U.S. universities. We have steadily grown our
	international program from 1,180 students as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, to 1,371 students as of June&nbsp;30, 2015, and further to 1,913 as of June&nbsp;30, 2016 and many of our students have been accepted to top universities abroad.

	Each of our schools is located within Zhuji city and is situated on spacious campuses. As of June&nbsp;30,
	2016, our three schools in aggregate had over 854 multi-media classrooms, all with Wi-Fi-coverage, over 2,136 computers and tablet computers, 18 sports fields and approximately 2,704 student dormitory rooms.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We generally require all of our students to board at our schools, and substantially all of our students are housed in our boarding facilities.
	Each student dormitory building houses between 100 to 1,500 students per building. Students who wish to commute and not board at our schools are reviewed and admitted on a case-by-case basis and generally we only accept non-boarding applications
	from kindergarten students or students that can demonstrate a feasible commuting arrangement that would not affect their ability to attend our school programs in any material way. Boarding fees generally range from RMB2,000 to RMB6,000 per school
	year, depending on, among other factors, the grade of the students as well as the level of accommodation required. A majority of our boarding students are from areas outside of Zhuji. Our boarding facilities provide an attractive option to parents
	who want their children to experience living outside the home before attending college in China or overseas.

	Under the supervision of our
	board of directors, our school system is managed by a seven-member principals committee. The committee consists of a principal general in charge of our overall school operations, three vice principals in charge of each of our three schools, and
	another three vice principals separately in charge of our international program, security and logistics, and human resources and student affairs. The committee meets on a monthly basis and the meeting agenda consists of regulatory updates, industry
	news, curriculum development and operation adjustments. We believe effective and timely exchange among the principals of our schools and executives of our group ensures consistent quality in educational services as well as efficient resource
	allocation and school management.

	in Xiantao No.1 Middle School (the &#147;Xiantao School&#148;) in Hubei province, China, for a total consideration of approximately $33.7 million (RMB224 million). In June 2016, we entered into a framework agreement with Zhejiang Hailiang to provide

	We primarily use course materials designated by the governmental authorities for our basic educational program which we complement with materials that our teachers have designed and developed based on their research and experience. We also offer
	after-school courses based on our students&#146; special interests and needs, such as workshops for science competitions.

	In addition to our basic educational program, students can also elect to be placed into our international program which is geared towards
	students who wish to study abroad. PRC students in our international program take courses required by the PRC regulatory authority and earn a Chinese school diploma. As most of the students in our international program plan to study abroad after
	they graduate from our middle school or high school programs, we have designed our international program to specifically address the needs of these students in terms of both language and academics. In particular, in addition to mandatory advanced
	English courses, our international program also includes intensive language courses designed to prepare students for examinations required by undergraduate programs in English-speaking countries such as TOEFL and IELTS. We also provide Korean
	language courses, given the rising popularity of South Korean undergraduate programs among Chinese students. In addition, for students planning to apply to undergraduate programs in the U.S. and the U.K., we provide courses designed to help students
	become admitted to these programs, such as A-levels courses for U.K. universities and SAT courses for U.S. universities. We also provide counseling services to help students choose and apply for the colleges and universities that best fit their
	strengths and goals. Although historically we have cooperated with other educational service providers in providing education in our international program, all the coursework in our international program is currently administered by our own faculty.
	Our international program also includes a number of non-PRC students who are studying Chinese as a second language.

	and 1,913 students as of June&nbsp;30, 2016. In addition, the 2012/2013 school year was the first year we expanded the international program beyond the high school level by creating international program classes in the primary and middle school
	levels. We intend to continue to enhance our international program, especially at the primary and middle school levels.

	prepare and take the Chinese Proficiency Test administered by the Department of Education of the PRC and the Gaokao for admission to universities in China. We also offer subjects featuring Chinese culture, such as Chinese History, Chinese Geography,
	Martial Arts and Chinese Painting and Calligraphy. As of June&nbsp;30, 2016, we had 67 foreign students coming from countries including, but not limited to, South Korea, Germany, Russia, Brazil, the United States, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.
	As part of our international focus, we have organized summer camp programs in the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Australia, and South Korea in conjunction with other educational service providers. These summer camp programs are open to
	both our basic educational program students as well as our international program students. During the summer of 2016, around 140 of our students participated in these summer programs.

	learn, a passion for their areas of interest and an ability to contribute to a positive classroom dynamic. These characteristics are generally identified through personal interviews by admissions representatives.

	We routinely

	Zhongkao and the Gaokao. We require our teachers to regularly evaluate their students against academic standards and to set specific goals with their students. Our students take all standardized tests required by state and local authorities, and we
	also administer our own annual tests calibrated to our academic standards. Student academic achievement in our schools has been substantial, as measured by these external assessments. For example, over 95% of our students in the 2015 graduate
	classes passed the Joint Graduation Exam, which is an annual provincial test administered to each graduating class. In addition, we have surpassed the Gaokao standard set by the Zhuji branch of the MOE. In the 2014/2015 school year, the Zhuji branch
	of the MOE required a minimum of 127 students to pass the admission cutoff of &#147;first tier universities.&#148; We exceeded this standard, with 231 students passing this admission cutoff in the 2014/2015 school year. From the 2015/2016 school
	year, the admission cutoff of &#147;first tier universities&#148; is no longer used by the PRC Ministry of Education. We continue to monitor the academic performance of our students through our own annual tests. In the 2016 graduate class, 138
	students who graduated from our international program received admission offers from overseas universities, including the University of California, Irvine (U.S.A.), Oregon State University (U.S.A.), and University of Sydney (Australia), University

	Upon graduating from kindergarten, primary or middle school, our students may choose to apply for admission into the next level of educational
	programs in our school system. Although some of our students may also choose to apply for admission into programs of other educational service providers, such as public schools, we have historically experienced a relatively high student retention
	rate, reflecting the wide recognition of our educational quality by students and parents. For our 2016 graduate classes, 72% of our primary school graduates were admitted into our middle schools and 73% of our middle school graduates were admitted
	into our high schools.

	From time to time, students may experience declining academic performance. Our teachers counsel and assist
	students on academic and personal matters in order to maximize student retention. Remedial courses are available for students with lower grades, and additional practice materials and sessions are also available for students experiencing academic
	difficulties. Our average net annual student retention rate for all students, which measures the percentage of students enrolled at the beginning of the year who move on to the next grade level was approximately 89.8% for the 2013/2014 school year,
	87.5% for the 2014/2015 school year, and 89.0&nbsp;% for the 2015/2016 school year.

	Our teachers had an average of over nine years of educational experience as of June&nbsp;30, 2016. We have built a team of veteran teachers with extensive teaching experience. These teachers have a passion for teaching, mastery of their subject

	Our schools are staffed with three levels of teachers and educational staff: senior teachers, mid-level
	teachers and junior teachers. Senior teachers are outstanding teachers chosen by our schools for their excellent teaching and their ability to improve student performance. All of our senior teachers have obtained &#147;Advanced Teaching
	Qualifications&#148;. Starting from the beginning of the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2016, we no longer count mid-level teachers with nationally-qualified first degree teaching qualifications towards senior teachers, and instead count them
	towards Mid-level teachers. Mid-level teachers are teachers with nationally-qualified first, second, or third degree teaching qualifications. Junior teachers are teachers who have not yet received their teaching certification. Senior teachers have
	managerial responsibilities in addition to their responsibilities as classroom instructors. We believe this three-tier seniority system provides an attractive career path and allows new teachers to be mentored by more experienced teachers. As of
	June&nbsp;30, 2016, our team of teachers and educational staff consisted of 152 senior teachers, 869 mid-level teachers and 352 junior teachers.

	We follow a specific process for faculty hiring which we have developed over the years. Teachers are hired based on classroom experience,
	educational background, expertise in their specific subject areas, leadership ability, communication skills with students and parents and a commitment to students and teaching. We expect teachers to have or develop excellent technical teaching
	skills, the ability to mentor other teachers and the ability to develop innovative curriculum. They are also required to meet PRC regulatory requirements. On our website as well as in national media and publications, we post descriptions of vacant
	positions, which include educational and experience requirements, faculty duties and the knowledge and skills required. We also recruit qualified graduates from reputable teaching universities and schools in China. We review official transcripts and
	resumes to evaluate a candidate&#146;s academic achievement and work experience. Qualified candidates are interviewed, required to pass a written examination and are also required to teach a mock class in front of our assessment board who finally
	decides on whether to extend an offer.

	Newly hired teachers undergo a training program on teaching skills and techniques as well as our

	Our

	our senior teachers additional incentives such as extra bonuses, opportunities to study abroad and housing allowances. In general, the compensation levels between teachers at our schools varies more widely than in local public schools. We believe
	that this structure encourages competition, and along with career advancement opportunities and continuing training, allows us to recruit and retain talented teachers. In addition to incentivizing qualified teachers to stay, we also take an
	aggressive approach to removing approximately 5% to 10% of teachers and educational staff who do not meet our teaching standards on a yearly basis. Our teacher retention rates as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2015, and 2016 were 91.6%, 97.6% and 90.5%,
	respectively. &#147;Retention rate&#148; is calculated as 100% minus the quotient of the number of teachers who cease being employed during the period by the number of teachers at the beginning of that period (not including teachers hired during

	the total number of students in K-12 schools also increased from 8.5% to 16.5% during the same period. However, in 2012, the top six private schools in China, including our Company, only enrolled 0.3% of the total private school students in China,

	Because the market share of private K-12 schools is relatively small compared to that of public

	resources that we do not have. Some of these competitors, particularly public schools, have governmental support in forms of government subsidies and other payments or fee reductions. These competitors may devote greater resources, financial or

	(ZFGJ [2011] No.&nbsp;96), or the Notice, under the Notice, private primary schools and secondary schools of Zhuji city are approved to charge tuition, accommodation fees and the registration fees from their students. In
	addition, the charging standards of the tuition fee and the accommodation fee should consider the compensation of the education costs and the accommodation costs, and properly consider the requiring of reasonable returns of the private schools. The
	charging standard of the registration fees should be in accordance with the principle of &#147;voluntary payment, accurate calculation of expenses, timely settlement and regular disclosure.&#148; Specifically, the textbook fee cannot exceed RMB365
	for grade 10 and grade 11 and cannot exceed RMB265 for grade 12. In addition, in November 2012, the Zhuji branch of the MOE issued a notice which clarified the maximum amount of tuition we can charge our students. Specifically, the maximum amount we
	can charge for primary school, middle school and high school is RMB31,000 per student, RMB33,000 per student and RMB35,000 per student, respectively. The Zhuji branch of the MOE did not place any limit on the amount we can charge for our
	kindergarten and our international program, but did require us to report the amounts we charge for those programs. In the 2011/2012, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 school years, our tuition has been below the aforementioned ceilings

	remains unclear, we believe, based on the advice of our PRC counsel, that CSRC approval was not required in the context of our initial public offering as we are not a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of acquiring
	domestic companies that are controlled by our PRC individual shareholders, as we acquired contractual control rather than equity interests in our domestic affiliated entities. However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC government agency,

	sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the
	proceeds from our initial public offering into the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our ADSs.

	the specific provisions of the laws and regulations applicable to sponsors and owners, such as provisions regarding the right to receive returns on investment and the right to the distribution of residual properties upon termination and liquidation.
	Each of our schools has been registered as a school that requires &#147;reasonable returns.&#148; Under PRC laws and regulations, although private education is mainly treated as a public welfare undertaking, sponsors of schools may choose to require
	reasonable returns from the annual earnings of the school after deduction of certain costs, expenses, donations, subsidies and required contributions to development funds. Hailiang Investment is the sponsor of each of the three schools we currently
	operate as registered pursuant to applicable PRC laws and regulations. For more information regarding the nature of schools requiring reasonable returns under relevant laws and regulations, school sponsorship and difference between sponsorship and
	ownership under relevant laws and regulations, see &#147;&#151;B. Business Overview&#151;Regulations&#151;Regulations on Private Education&#151;The Law for Promoting Private Education (2003)&nbsp;and the Implementation Rules for the Law for
	Promoting Private Education (2004).&#148;

	We currently operate three centrally managed schools through our PRC affiliated entities, namely Zhuji Hailiang Foreign Language School, Zhuji
	Private High School and Tianma Experimental School. These schools are all located in Zhuji city, Zhejiang province in China. In September 2015, Zhuji Hailiang Foreign Language School and selected programs from Tianma Experimental School and Zhuji
	Private High School relocated to the Hailiang Educational Park. Tianma Experimental School&#146;s and Zhuji Private High School&#146;s remaining programs continue to operate on their existing respective campuses. As of June&nbsp;30, 2016, 18,673
	students were enrolled in our schools. We have experienced significant growth in our business. Our revenue increased by 11.2% from RMB462.8 million in the 2014 fiscal year to RMB514.8 million in the 2015 fiscal year and further increased by 27% to
	RMB654.1 million (approximately US$98.4 million) in the 2016 fiscal year. These increases were driven primarily by an increase in the average tuition charged per student during the same periods. Our gross profit increased by 10.5% from RMB163.1
	million in the 2014 fiscal year to RMB180.3 million in the 2015 fiscal year, and decreased by 9.7% to RMB162.7 million (approximately US$24.5 million) in the 2016 fiscal year. Our net profit increased by 0.2% from RMB140.7 million in the 2014 fiscal
	year to RMB141.0 million in the 2015 fiscal year and reduced by 29.5% to RMB99.4 million (approximately US$15.0 million) in the 2016 fiscal year . In particular, in line with our strategy to increase enrollment in our international program, we have
	increased the proportion of revenue derived from students enrolled in our international program from 15.1% of revenue in the 2014 fiscal year to 15.9% of revenue in the 2015 fiscal year and 18.7% of revenue in the 2016 fiscal year.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	including the level of student enrollment, the pricing of our educational programs and our ability to control costs and expenses.

	Demand for private K-12 education in China
</I>
	. We have benefited from increasing demand for private K-12 education in China in the last decade. This increase was driven by the overall economic growth, the rise in
	household disposable income and household spending on education, as well as an improvement in the education system and policies relating to K-12 education in China. According to the CCID Report, the total number of private K-12 schools increased
	from 89,383 in 2006 to 145,817 in 2013, and the proportion of students in private K-12 schools against the total number of students in K-12 schools also increased from 8.5% to 16.5% during the same period. We anticipate that the demand for private
	K-12 education in China will continue to grow which we expect will provide us with significant market opportunity to expand our business.

	The private K-12 school industry in the Yangtze River Delta region where our schools are located has also been growing. According to the CCID
	report, the total number of students enrolled in private K-12 schools in the Yangtze River Delta region increased from 3.4&nbsp;million in 2008 to 3.6&nbsp;million in 2012. The percentage of students in private K-12 schools against the total number
	of K-12 students in the region increased from 17.7% to 18.6% during the same period. Rising income levels have also provided greater opportunities for Chinese students to study abroad. As a result, the number of students enrolled in school programs
	with a focus on preparing students for studying abroad, or international programs, has grown significantly. According to the CCID Report, there were a total of approximately 144,400 students enrolled in international school programs in 2012 in
	China, a figure that is expected to rise in the coming years. The number of students enrolled in our international program has also increased rapidly, from 1,180 as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, to 1,371 students as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 and 1,913 students
	as of June&nbsp;30, 2016. We intend to continue to grow our international program to take advantage of the growing demand.

	. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, we had a total of 16,875, 17,506, and 18,673 students, respectively. While we expect the number of students will be relatively stable in the
	next two fiscal years, we plan to increase the proportion of students enrolled in our international program because our international program charges a tuition fee that is significantly higher than that of our basic educational program. We have
	already begun making this transition. For example, the number of students enrolled in the international program increased from 1,180 students as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 to 1,371 students as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 and 1,913 students as of June&nbsp;30,
	2016, with the proportion of our students enrolled in the international program increasing from 7.0% to 7.8% and 10.2% during the same period, respectively. We intend to continue to grow our international program to take advantage of the growing

	Pricing of educational programs.
</I>
	&nbsp;Our results of operations are affected by the pricing of our educational programs. We generally charge student tuition based on his or her grade level and whether the student
	attends our basic educational program or international program. Tuition includes boarding, school services and books. The tuition we may charge for some of our education programs is subject to regulatory restrictions. For example, the most recent
	ceiling on the amount of tuition and boarding expenses we can charge was set out by the Zhuji branch of the MOE in November 2012, which sets forth the maximum amounts of tuition and boarding expenses for primary school, middle school and high school
	as RMB31,000 per student, RMB33,000 per student and RMB35,000 per student, respectively. There is currently no maximum amount set for our kindergarten or international program. Pursuant to the registration documents filed with local authorities for
	the 2013/2014 school year, we are approved to charge RMB55,000 to RMB100,000 for our international program. For the 2015/2016 school year, tuition for our international program was still within this range. The tuition limitation is reviewed by the
	regulatory authority on a periodic basis. See &#147;Item 4. Information on the Company&#151;B. Business Overview&#151;Regulations&#151;Regulations on Private Education&#151;The Law for Promoting Private Education (2003)&nbsp;and the Implementation
	Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004).&#148; Subject to the applicable regulatory requirements, we generally determine tuition based on the demand for our educational programs, the cost of our educational services and the tuition
	and the fees charged by our competitors, and seek to increase tuition by approximately 5% to 15% each year. For example, in the 2014, 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, the average tuition for primary, middle and high school, including both our basic
	educational program and our international program, was RMB27,422, RMB29,406 and RMB35,027 (approximately US$5,270), respectively. The increase was also due to a greater proportion of students enrolled in the international program which charges
	higher tuition. In the 2014, 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, tuition charged for students in our international program was approximately twice as high as tuition charged for students in our basic educational program.

	Revenue from our basic educational program increased by RMB40.1 million or 10.2%, from the 2014
	fiscal year to 2015 fiscal year, and further increased by RMB98.6 million (approximately US$14.8 million), or 22.8% from the 2015 fiscal year to 2016 fiscal year. This was driven primarily by an increase in the average tuition charged per student
	during the same periods. In addition, revenue derived from tuition of students enrolled in our international program compared to our total revenue increased from 15.1% in the 2014 fiscal year to 15.9% in the 2015 fiscal year and further to 18.7% in
	the 2016 fiscal year. This is due primarily to an increase in the number of students enrolled in our international program and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average tuition charged in our international program.

	Our cost of revenue primarily consists of labor costs, which are compensation to our teachers and educational staff, student-related costs and,
	to a lesser extent, transportation costs, utility costs and leasing fees for our schools. Our cost of revenue increased from the 2014 fiscal year to the 2015 fiscal year and further to the 2016 fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in labor
	costs resulting from an increase in the total number of our teachers and educational staff, an increase in the total number of senior and experienced teachers and a general increase in our compensation levels, an increase in student-related costs
	resulting from the increase in the number of students enrolled and the increased cost of our student canteen service and an increase in leasing fees and depreciation for the relocation to Hailiang Education Park. We expect our cost of revenue to
	increase in line with our increase in revenue, driven in large part by a planned increase in the number of teachers to support our growing international program.

	Our selling expenses consist of advertisement expenses, recruiting expenses and amortization related to intangible assets. Our overall selling
	expenses remained relatively stable in the 2015 fiscal year compared with that of the 2014 fiscal year. Our overall selling expenses in the 2016 fiscal year increased by 7.8% and primarily due to increased student enrollment rewards on recruitment.

	overall administrative expenses increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to an increase in the expenses incurred in relation to our initial public offering, partially offset by a decrease in the maintenance cost incurred in the year ended
	June&nbsp;30, 2015. Our overall administrative expenses in the 2016 fiscal year increased 31.2% and primarily due to increased salary cost in relation to the need for new campus Hailiang Education Park as well as more board officers on board in the
	year ended June&nbsp;30, 2016. We expect that our overall administrative expenses will also remain relatively stable in the near future.

	Other income

	schools. Prior to admission, new students are required to pay a deposit. Upon the students&#146; enrollment, the deposit is applied towards the tuition fee payment. The deposit is generally not refundable if the student does not subsequently enroll
	in the school.

	Under the New EIT Law, dividends paid by an FIE to any of its foreign non-resident enterprise

	enterprise investor&#146;s jurisdiction of incorporation has signed a tax treaty or arrangement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income with China. There is such a tax arrangement
	between the PRC and Hong Kong. Thus, the dividends, if and when payable by our PRC subsidiary to the offshore parent entity located in Hong Kong, would be subject to a 5% withholding tax rather than the statutory rate of 10%, provided that the
	offshore entities located in Hong Kong meet the requirements stipulated by relevant PRC tax regulations. Furthermore, pursuant to the applicable circular and interpretations of the New EIT Law, dividends from earnings created prior to 2008 but
	distributed after 2008 are not subject to withholding income tax. We have not provided for deferred income tax liabilities on the PRC entities&#146; undistributed earnings of RMB 494.0&nbsp;million and RMB607.6 million (approximately US$91.4
	million) as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2016, respectively, because we control the timing of the undistributed earnings and it is probable that the earnings will not be distributed. We plan to reinvest those earnings in the PRC indefinitely in the
	foreseeable future.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, which requires us to make judgments, estimates
	and assumptions that affect: (i)&nbsp;the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, (ii)&nbsp;the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period, and (iii)&nbsp;the reported amounts of revenue and
	expenses during each reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives and the recoverability of the carrying amounts of property and equipment and intangible assets (including goodwill), the
	collectability of other receivables and term deposits placed with a related party finance entity, and the assessment of contingent liabilities and income tax. These estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that management
	believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment
	within the next financial year are included in Note 2 to the financial statements included in this annual report.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We continually evaluate
	these estimates based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, our expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form our basis
	for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or
	results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of comprehensive income and corresponding statement of financial condition accounts would be necessary. These adjustments
	would be made in future financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	When reading our financial statements, you should consider (i)&nbsp;our critical accounting
	policies, (ii)&nbsp;the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, and (iii)&nbsp;the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies involve
	the most significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. We have not made any material changes in the methodology used in these accounting policies during the past two years.

	The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use,

	Our revenue increased by 27% from
	RMB514.8 million in the 2015 fiscal year to RMB654.1 million (approximately US$98.4 million). This increase was primarily due to a 19% increase in average tuition from RMB29,406 to RMB35,027 (approximately US$5,270) and to a lesser extent, a 6.7%
	increase in the total number of students from 17,506 to 18,673 during the same period. Our revenue increase was also attributable to having a greater proportion of our students enrolled in our international program which charges higher tuition than
	our basic educational program. Between the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, the percentage of students enrolled in our international program increased from 7.8% to 10.2%.

	Our cost of revenue
	increased by 46.9% from RMB334.5 million in the 2015 fiscal year to RMB491.4 million (approximately US$73.9 million) in the 2016 fiscal year. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a) a 32.3% increase in labor costs due to (i)&nbsp;an
	increase in the number of senior and experienced teachers to enhance education quality, and (ii)&nbsp;a general increase in our employees&#146; compensation levels; b) a 31.5% increase in student-related costs, primarily due to the increase in the
	number of students enrolled and the increased cost of our student canteen service, and c) the increase of depreciation by 165.9% due to the relocation to Hailiang Education Park.

	RMB0.32 million (approximately US$0.05 million) in the 2016 fiscal year. Our other miscellaneous income primarily relates to forfeits of deposits for students who did not enroll in our schools.

	Our revenue increased by 11.2%
	from RMB462.8 million in the 2014 fiscal year to RMB514.8 million in the 2015 fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to a 7.2% increase in average tuition from RMB27,422 to RMB29,406 and to a lesser extent, a 3.7% increase in the total number
	of students from 16,875 to 17,506 during the same period. Our revenue increase was also attributable to having a greater proportion of our students enrolled in our international program which charges higher tuition than our basic educational
	program. Between the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years, the percentage of students enrolled in our international program increased from 7.0% to 7.8%.

	year. This increase was generally in line with the increase in our revenue during the same period. In particular, the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a) a 14.8% increase in labor costs due to (i)&nbsp;an increase in the number of
	senior and experienced teachers to enhance education quality, and (ii)&nbsp;a general increase in our employees&#146; compensation levels and b) a 12.3% increase in student-related costs, primarily due to the increase in the number of students

	We historically had recorded significant related party transactions involving advances and loans made to, and

	private education business with a related party finance company owned by Hailiang Group. To reduce our credit exposure with Hailiang Finance, based upon our current policy effective September 2016, we have set an upper deposit budget maintained by
	Hailiang Finance at any given time in fiscal 2017 to be approximately RMB 650&nbsp;million (approximately US$ 97.80 million), and any amount above the upper deposit budget must be transferred to a commercial bank within 7 business days. As of
	June&nbsp;30, 2016, we had demand deposits of RMB171.7 million (approximately US$25.8 million) at Hailiang Finance. Hailiang Finance is a non-bank financial institution licensed by the China Bank Regulatory Commission. It was incorporated in
	February 2013. It currently has a registered capital of RMB1.0 billion and has been approved by the relevant authorities to conduct business with other entities within Hailiang Group, including, among other things, receiving deposits, borrowing,
	lending and providing guarantees, providing accounting and financing consultancy, and providing trade settlement and insurance brokerage services. We believe that Hailiang Finance provides interest at market rates with flexible withdrawal terms on
	our deposits. Based on our review of relevant documents provided by Hailiang Finance, we believe that Hailiang Finance has satisfactory asset quality, liquidity position and internal control environment. In addition, in September 2014, Hailiang
	Group and Mr.&nbsp;Feng entered into a guarantee agreement with us to irrevocably and jointly guarantee the timely return of such deposits on behalf of the finance company in the event that the finance company defaults on the return of such deposits
	or payment of the interest. After considering the terms provided by Hailiang Finance, coupled with its financial condition as well as the guarantee provided by Hailiang Group and Mr.&nbsp;Feng, our board approved the arrangement in December 2015 and
	our audit committee reviews our related party transactions, including the deposit arrangement from time to time. We, however, recognize that there are risks involved in the cash deposit arrangement. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk
	Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry&#151;We deposit a certain amount of cash with a related party and are subject to credit risks of such related party.&#148;

	We have
	strong research and development capabilities and have devoted significant resources developing our courses and innovative teaching methods and materials. For each senior teacher, we have a senior teacher workshop, which consists of that teacher and
	five to ten mid-level or junior teachers who teach the same grade and subject. The workshop regularly organizes meetings to discuss and exchange ideas on instruction methods. Teachers in the senior teacher workshop are given opportunities to publish
	articles on pedagogical methods and teaching techniques with guidance from the senior teachers.

	In addition, we encourage our teachers to
	develop, update and improve our curricula and course materials based upon the latest official government curricula for each of our subjects as well as on students&#146; needs and preferences. The development process for our curricula and course
	materials typically starts with a review of the latest examination requirements to analyze new educational needs and trends. As our students&#146; academic ability levels vary widely, our curricula are designed with the flexibility to address a
	particular class or a particular student&#146;s strengths and weaknesses. Our senior teachers in charge of the curriculum for a particular subject also work with other teachers to prepare or update course curricula. Our teachers also implement and
	revise the curricula based on feedback from the classroom.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Leveraging our research and development capabilities, we have developed
	teaching methods and courses for certain subjects that are not generally offered by other similar private education providers. For example, one of our vice principals, Ms.&nbsp;Jihong Zheng, has designed the &#147;Jihong English Innovation
	Class&#148; based on a widely recognized English teaching method in China that she created. Her course supplements the standard English curriculum with various added features, such as field trips and community service. These allow students to
	practice speaking English in real-world situations while enjoying field trips or performing community service that provides a sense of social responsibility and teamwork. We have also supplemented various government-mandated coursework with our
	self-developed courses. For example, we expanded the traditional chemistry coursework with a supplementary course called &#147;Chemistry in Our Lives,&#148; which demonstrates how chemistry principles and theories are applied in people&#146;s daily
	lives. We believe students&#146; exposure to such real-world examples helps them to learn. We have also developed a supplemental mathematics course called &#147;History of Mathematics,&#148; which exposes our students to the cross-disciplinary
	approach of learning about the history of how certain mathematical principles were discovered or formulated, which, we believe, generates greater interest in the subject matter. We also offer a local geography course called &#147;Hometown
	Geography&#151;Zhuji and Shaoxing &#145;Tantou&#146;&#148; for purposes of getting students to apply the geographical approaches and principles they learn to local cities, towns and rural areas.

	deposits, respectively. During the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2016, our deposits with the finance company are generally made in the form of demand deposits or term deposits with terms ranging from three months to one year. The demand deposits are held
	for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, such as to pay for our operating expenses at any time. The term deposits are held for investment purposes and can be withdrawn prior to their maturity without incurring significant penalties.
	We are subject to credit risks associated with the term deposit arrangement. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry&#151;We deposit a certain amount of cash with related parties and

	from RMB4.6 million in the 2012 fiscal year to RMB9.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year. For the 2014 fiscal year, our total rental expenses remained at RMB9.6 million. For the 2015 fiscal year, our total rental expenses also remained at RMB9.6
	million. On November&nbsp;18, 2015, the Company entered into the lease agreement with Zhejiang Hailiang regarding Hailiang Educational Park. The term of the lease is for twenty years and the rental fee in the first year is RMB20.0 million
	(approximately $ 3.0 million) and is subject to a 5% increase in the next three years. The rental fee commencing from the fifth year is subject to further negotiation between the Company and Zhejiang Hailiang. The lease covers the properties and
	facilities of Hailiang Educational Park with a total gross floor area and site area of approximately 550,000 square meters and 850,000 square meters, respectively. As a result, for the 2016 fiscal year, our total rental expenses increased to RMB25.4
	million (approximately US$3.8 million). The terms of our leases are for twenty years. All of our current leases contain priority renewal provisions which provide that we have the right of first refusal to renew the lease upon the expiration of the
	lease. Under the leasing agreements, we can terminate the lease at any time without cause, provided we notify the lessor in writing three months in advance. The lessor may only terminate the agreements upon a written notice to us one year in advance
	for any unapproved sublease by the lessee, unapproved modification to the premises, failure to pay rent for more than 60 days or use of the properties for illegal activities. To terminate the leases for other causes, the lessor would have to give us
	written notice one year in advance and obtain our consent to such termination. However, there is no assurance that the lessor will observe its obligations under these leasing agreements. As a result, at the end of each year or the term of the lease,
	we may fail to reach an agreement for a rental price or otherwise fail to continue to lease the properties. We may be forced to relocate the affected operations to a new location, which could involve substantial rent increases and material business
	interruption.

	Hailiang Inc. is a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and its income depends primarily on dividends from our PRC subsidiary.
	The
<I>
	New EIT Law
</I>
	and its implementation rules provide that an income tax rate of 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprise shareholders unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to
	treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions. Under the
<I>
	Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement
</I>
	, dividends paid by a foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC to its direct holding company,
	which is considered a Hong Kong tax resident and is determined by the PRC tax authority to have satisfied relevant requirements under the
<I>
	Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement
</I>
	between China and Hong Kong and other applicable PRC laws, will be
	subject to withholding tax at the rate of 5%. Entitlement to a lower tax rate on dividends according to tax treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions is subject to approval of the
	relevant tax authority. Furthermore, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated Circular 601 in October 2009, which provides guidance for determining whether a resident of a contracting state is the &#147;beneficial owner&#148; of an item of
	income under China&#146;s tax treaties and tax arrangements. Under Circular 601, a beneficial owner generally must be engaged in substantive business activities. An agent or conduit company will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and, therefore,
	will not qualify for tax benefits under the treaties or arrangements. The conduit company normally refers to a company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits. See &#147;Item 3. Key
	Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Doing Business in China&#151;Our subsidiaries and affiliated entities in China are subject to restrictions on making dividends and other payments to us.&#148;

	Under the
<I>
	New EIT Law
</I>
	, enterprises established under the laws of jurisdictions outside China with their &#147;de facto management
	body&#148; located within China may be considered to be PRC tax resident enterprises for tax purposes and therefore subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on their worldwide income. The New EIT Law Implementation Regulations define
	the term &#147;de facto management body&#148; as a management body that exercises full or substantial control and management authority over the production, operation, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. The State Administration of
	Taxation issued the
<I>
	Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82
</I>
	, on April&nbsp;22, 2009. Circular 82
	provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &#147;de facto management body&#148; of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise is located in China, which include all of the following conditions: (i)&nbsp;the senior
	management and core management departments in charge of daily operations are located mainly within the PRC, (ii)&nbsp;financial and human resources decision are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC, (iii)&nbsp;major
	assets, accounting books, company seals and minutes and files of board and shareholders&#146; meeting are located or kept within the PRC, and (iv)&nbsp;at least half of the enterprise&#146;s directors with voting rights or senior management reside
	within the PRC. Although Circular 82 explicitly provides that the above standards apply to enterprises which are registered outside the PRC and funded by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups as controlling investors, the determining criteria set
	forth in Circular 82 may reflect the general position of the State Administration of Taxation on how the &#147;de facto management body&#148; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of
	whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups or by PRC or foreign individuals. We currently do not believe that we or our Hong Kong subsidiary meet all of the conditions above thus we do not believe that we are, or our
	Hong Kong subsidiary is, a PRC resident enterprise but there can be no assurance in this regard. If we and/or our Hong Kong subsidiary were considered to be a PRC tax resident enterprise, we and/or our Hong Kong subsidiary would be subject to a PRC
	enterprise income tax on our and/or its worldwide income at a tax rate of 25% and to certain reporting obligations. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Doing Business in China&#151;Under the
<I>
	New EIT
	Law
</I>

	The implementation rules of the
<I>
	New EIT Law
</I>
	provide that, (i)&nbsp;if the enterprise that distributes dividends is domiciled in the
	PRC, or (ii)&nbsp;if gains are realized from transferring equity interests of enterprises domiciled in the PRC, then such dividends or capital gains are treated as China-sourced income. It is not clear how &#147;domicile&#148; may be interpreted
	under the
<I>
	New EIT Law
</I>
	, and it may be interpreted as the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a tax resident. Any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders or ADS holders as well as gains realized by such shareholders or ADS holders from
	the transfer of our shares or ADSs may be regarded as China-sourced income, if we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, and as a result, such dividends and capital gains paid to overseas shareholders or ADS holders that are
	non-PRC resident enterprises may become subject to PRC income tax at a rate of up to 10.0%, unless otherwise exempted or reduced under relevant tax treaties or arrangements between the PRC and relevant foreign jurisdictions. Under the
<I>
	PRC
	Individual Income Tax Law
</I>
	promulgated on September&nbsp;10, 1980, as amended in 1993, 1999, 2005, 2007 and 2011 and its implementation rules, dividends from sources within the PRC paid to foreign individual investors who are not residents of the
	PRC are ordinarily subject to a PRC withholding tax at a rate of 20% and PRC source gains realized by such investors on the transfer of ADSs or shares would be subject to 20% PRC income tax, in each case, subject to any reduction or exemption set
	forth in applicable tax treaties and PRC laws. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Doing Business in China&#151;Under the
<I>
	New EIT Law

	Under a published IRS Notice, common or ordinary shares, or ADSs
	representing such shares, are considered to be readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States if they are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, as are our ADSs (but not our ordinary shares). Based on existing guidance, it is
	unclear whether the ordinary shares are considered to be readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, because only the ADSs, and not the underlying ordinary shares, are listed on a securities market in the United
	States. We believe, but we cannot assure you, that dividends we pay on the ordinary shares that are represented by ADSs, but not on the ordinary shares that are not so represented, are, subject to applicable limitations, eligible for the reduced
	rates of taxation if we are not a PFIC. In addition, if we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC tax law (see &#147;&#151;People&#146;s Republic of China Taxation&#148;), then we may be eligible for the benefits of the income tax

	date or if such United States Holders elect to treat the dividend income as &#147;investment income&#148; pursuant to Section&nbsp;163(d)(4) of the Code. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends of a qualified foreign corporation

	Our financial statements are expressed in Renminbi, and substantially all of our revenue, costs and expenses are denominated in Renminbi.
	Additionally, our cash and cash equivalents are held in both Renminbi and U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Renminbi may affect our results of operations and financial condition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Renminbi&#146;s exchange rate with the U.S. dollar is affected by, among other things, changes in China&#146;s political and economic
	conditions and China&#146;s foreign exchange policies. On July&nbsp;21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under such policy, the Renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within
	a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Later on, the People&#146;s Bank of China has decided to further implement the reform of the RMB exchange regime and to enhance the flexibility of RMB exchange rates. Such
	changes in policy have resulted in a significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar since 2005 though there have been periods when the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the Renminbi as well. There remains significant
	international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant adjustment of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from financing activities into the Renminbi for our operations or other uses
	within the PRC, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. On the other hand, a decline in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar could
	reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results, the value of your investment in our company and the dividends we may pay in the future, if any, all of which may have a material adverse effect on the prices of ADSs. As of
	June&nbsp;30, 2016, we had U.S. dollar-denominated cash balances of US$17.9 million. Assuming we had converted the US$17.9 million into the Renminbi at the exchange rate of US$1.00 for RMB 6.6459 as of June&nbsp;30, 2016, this cash balance would
	have been RMB118.7 million. Assuming a 1% appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, this cash balance would have decreased by RMB1.2 million (approximately US$178.5 thousand).

	The depositary fees payable upon the issuance and
	cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the depositary bank by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) receiving the newly issued ADSs from the depositary bank and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the depositary
	bank for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these fees to their clients. Depositary fees payable in connection with distributions of cash or securities to ADS holders and the depositary services fee are charged by the depositary bank to the
	holders of record of ADSs as of the applicable ADS record date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally deducted
	from the cash being distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. In the case of distributions other than cash (i.e.,&nbsp;share dividends, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the ADS record
	date holders concurrent with the distribution. In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated or uncertificated in direct registration), the depositary bank sends invoices to the applicable record date
	ADS&nbsp;holders. In the case of ADSs held in brokerage and custodian accounts (via the Depository Trust Company, or the DTC), the depositary bank generally collects its fees through the systems provided by DTC (whose nominee is the registered
	holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians holding ADSs in their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who hold their clients&#146; ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients&#146; accounts the amount of the fees paid
	to the depositary banks.

	In the event of refusal to pay the depositary fees, the depositary bank may, under the terms of the deposit

	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
	Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
	purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
	future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
	management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October&nbsp;20. 2016. The assessment was based on criteria established in the framework Internal
	Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of
	June&nbsp;30, 2016 due to a material weakness set forth below.

	an ongoing basis to our accounting personnel that cover a broad range of accounting and financial reporting topics, (iii)&nbsp;began developing a comprehensive manual with detailed guidance on accounting policies and procedures as well as procedures

	Because we are in the process of implementing such remediation measures, management concluded

	continue to implement additional measures to remediate the existing material weakness as discussed above. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to remediate the material weakness as discussed above, or that we will not identify
	additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future. In addition, the process of designing and implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in
	our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to employ significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that satisfies our reporting obligations. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks

	in connection with their opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement, or (2)&nbsp;reportable events as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, except that KPMG advised the Company of the material weaknesses relating to (i)
	lack of sufficient control as to the board or management approval on related party transactions and (ii) insufficient resources for financial information processing and reporting and lack of appropriate IFRS knowledge.

	2015 and 2014 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except that an explanatory paragraph was added to emphasize that the Company
	entered into significant transactions with related parties.

	As a Cayman Islands company listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we

	our home country, the Cayman Islands, does not require a majority of our board to consist of independent directors. Currently, a majority of our board members are independent. Other than those described above, there are no significant differences

	Risks and uncertainties of the Contractual Arrangements:
</B>
	The Company relies on the Contractual Agreements to control the Affiliated Entities. However, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct equity ownership in providing the Company with control over the Affiliated Entities.
	Any failure by Hailiang Investment or Mr.&nbsp;Feng, the nominee shareholder of Hailiang Investment, to perform the obligations under the Contractual Agreements would have a material adverse effect on the financial position and financial performance
	of the Company. Therefore, the enforceability of the Contractual Agreements represents a significant judgment and assumption. All the Contractual Agreements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in
	the PRC. Accordingly, these agreements would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as some other jurisdictions, such as
	the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit the Company&#146;s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In addition, if the legal structure and the Contractual Agreements were found to be in violation
	of any existing or future PRC laws and regulations, the Company may be subject to fines or other legal or administrative sanctions.

	The Group considers evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortized cost (other receivables) at both a specific asset and

	According to the Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education in 2004, or the 2004 Implementing Rules,
	private schools, whether requiring reasonable returns or not, may enjoy preferential tax treatment. The 2004 Implementing Rules provide that the relevant authorities under the State Council may introduce preferential tax treatments and related

	Based on a confirmation from the local tax authorities, the local tax authorities
	have agreed to apply the corporate income tax exemption treatment to each of the Three Schools for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2015 and 2016. As a result, no income tax expense was recognized for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2015 and

	The PRC tax system is subject

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the current EIT Law, dividends paid by an FIE to any of its foreign non-resident enterprise investors are subject to a 10% withholding
	tax. Thus, the dividends, if and when payable by the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries to their offshore parent entities, would be subject to 10% withholding tax. A lower tax rate will be applied if such foreign non-resident enterprise investor&#146;s
	jurisdiction of incorporation has signed a tax treaty or arrangement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income with China. There is such a tax arrangement between PRC and Hong Kong.
	Thus, the dividends, if and when payable by the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries to the offshore parent entities located in Hong Kong, would be subject to 5% withholding tax rather than statutory rate of 10% provided that the offshore entities
	located in Hong Kong meet the requirements stipulated by relevant PRC tax regulations. Furthermore, pursuant to the applicable circular and interpretations of the current EIT Law, dividends from earnings created prior to 2008 but distributed after
	2008 are not subject to withholding income tax. The Company has not provided for deferred income tax liabilities on the PRC entities&#146; undistributed earnings of RMB 494,044 and RMB 607,633 as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2016, respectively, because
	the Company controls the timing of the undistributed earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be distributed. The Company plans to reinvest those earnings in the PRC indefinitely in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, the current EIT Law treats enterprises established outside of China with &#147;effective management and control&#148; located in
	China as PRC resident enterprises for tax purposes. The term &#147;effective management and control&#148; is generally defined as exercising overall management and control over the business, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise.
	The Company, if considered a PRC resident enterprise for tax purposes, would be subject to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax at the rate of 25% on its worldwide income for the period after January&nbsp;1, 2008. During the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2014,
	2015 and 2016, the Company did not carry out any substantial business operations and therefore was not subject to PRC taxes.

	In September 2015, Foreign Language and selected programs from Tianma Experimental and Private High relocated
	to the newly constructed Hailiang Education Park. Tianma Experimental&#146;s and Private High&#146;s remaining programs continue to operate on their existing respective campuses. As of June&nbsp;30, 2016, the Group has ceased the lease of original
	campus site of Foreign Language, therefore, the leasehold improvement of the original campus of Foreign Language was written off, and the net book value of RMB 10,286 was recognized as disposal loss of leasehold improvement in the statement of
	profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
