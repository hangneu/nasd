	or acquiring, then developing and commercializing molecularly targeted therapies that, sequentially or in combination, are foundational for eradicating residual disease. Our Dx efforts aim to pair these product candidates with biomarker-based
	companion diagnostics that are designed to precisely identify, at the molecular level, the patients who are most likely to benefit from the therapies we develop.

	A kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific other molecules, called

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cancer is a
	heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division and growth. Cancerous cells that arise in the lymphatic system and bone marrow are referred to as hematological tumors. Cancer cells that arise in other tissues or organs
	are referred to as solid tumors. Researchers believe that exposure to chemical agents, viruses and various forms of radiation can cause genetic alterations that lead to cancer. Genetic predisposition also can increase the risk of cancer in some
	people. Epigenetic factors are also increasingly believed to contribute to development of cancer.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the
	United States, exceeded only by heart disease. The American Cancer Society, or ACS, estimates that, in 2016, there will be approximately 1.65&nbsp;million new cases of cancer and approximately 595,000 deaths from cancer in the United States. The
	World Health Organization estimated that 8.2&nbsp;million people worldwide died of cancer in 2012. According to ACS data, breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer are the most prevalent cancers in the United States.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination
	of these methods. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective when the disease is localized. Physicians generally use drug therapy when the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The
	goal of drug therapy is to damage and kill cancer cells or to interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the development, growth and survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several
	different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has been evolving from non-specific drugs that kill both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular pathways or activating alterations involved in
	cancer and drugs that activate the body&#146;s immune system to destroy cancer cells.

	Cytotoxic Chemotherapies
</I>
	. The earliest approach to
	pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs referred to as cytotoxic drugs that kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells through non-specific mechanisms, such as deterring cell metabolism or causing damage to cellular components required
	for survival and rapid growth. While these drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, many unmet medical needs for the treatment of cancer remain. Also, cytotoxic drug therapies act in an indiscriminate manner, killing healthy, as
	well as cancerous, cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow dose range above which the toxicity causes unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage to healthy cells and below which the drugs are not effective in
	eradicating cancer cells.

	Targeted Therapies.
</I>
	The next approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs, referred to as targeted
	therapeutics, that target specific biological molecules in the human body that play a role in rapid cell growth and the spread of cancer. Targeted therapeutics are designed to preferentially kill cancer cells and spare normal cells, to improve
	efficacy and minimize side effects. The drugs are designed to attack either a target that causes uncontrolled growth of cancer cells or a target on which cancer cells are more dependent for their growth than normal cells. These drugs focus on
	eradicating processes that help the cancer cell survive, but not on the oncogenes, which are the drivers or cause of the cancer itself.

<I>
	Molecularly-Targeted Therapies
</I>
	. A third approach to pharmacological cancer treatment is to develop drugs that affect oncogenes, the drivers that cause
	uncontrolled growth of cancer cells because of a specific activating molecular alteration. In some cases, these agents may be initially identified as molecular targeted therapeutics without knowledge, at the time of development, of the underlying
	genetic change causing the disease.

<I>
	About Trk
</I>
	. The Trk (tropomyosin receptor kinase) family of tyrosine kinase receptors, which include TrkA, TrkB and TrkC, are activated by neurotrophins,
	a family of nerve growth factors. The Trk family members play a key role in normal embryonic central neuronal cell development and differentiation and normal adult peripheral neuronal cell development and differentiation. Deregulated kinase
	activities of Trk family members occur due to gene rearrangements and translocations, mutations, overexpression and alternative splicing and are associated with a number of human neuronal and non-neuronal cancers.

<I>
	About ROS1
</I>
	. ROS1 belongs to the insulin-receptor superfamily. Like other tyrosine kinase receptor molecules, it plays a role in relaying growth signals
	from the environment outside the cell into the cell&#146;s nucleus. ROS1 is one of two orphan receptor tyrosine kinase family members with no known binding ligand. Molecular rearrangements of ROS1 create fusion proteins with constitutively active
	kinase domains that activate downstream signaling pathways, which lead to oncogenic properties in cells, including uncontrolled proliferation and resistance to cell death with increased tumor cell survival.

<I>
	About ALK (Anaplastic lymphoma kinase).
</I>
	ALK also belongs to the insulin-receptor superfamily and is related to ROS1. Aberrant ALK fusion proteins
	spontaneously form molecular structures that lead to self-activation and constitutive activity within cancer cells, via activation of signal transduction pathways and intracellular kinases that drive uncontrolled tumor cell growth, metabolism and
	survival.

</I>
	.&nbsp;The TAM receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases that function as homeostatic regulators that are prominent in the mature immune, reproductive, hematopoietic, vascular, and nervous systems.&nbsp;TAM has also been identified as playing a
	key role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, or EMT, and cancer stem cell expansion.&nbsp;Aberrantly elevated TAM signaling is associated with cancer progression, metastasis, and resistance to targeted therapies.&nbsp;In addition, because
	deficiencies in TAM signaling are thought to contribute to autoimmune disease, there could be a role for modulation of TAM in immunotherapy approaches to cancer.

	commercialize entrectinib, as well as a second product candidate, RXDX-102. As a result of the clinical results relating to entrectinib that we have seen to date, we designated RXDX-102 as a back-up compound to entrectinib. Accordingly, we will not
	devote further development resources to RXDX-102.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of the license agreement, on November&nbsp;6, 2013, we issued to NMS a warrant to acquire up to 16,667 shares of our common stock, which has
	an exercise price of $6.00 per share and is exercisable at any time at the option of the holder until November&nbsp;6, 2018. The terms of the license agreement also provided for an up-front payment to NMS of $7.0 million. When and if commercial
	sales of a product based on either or both of entrectinib or RXDX-102 begin, we will be obligated to pay NMS tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single digit percentage to a low double digit percentage (between 10% and 15%) of our net sales,
	depending on the amount of our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize the product. The license agreement also requires that we make development and regulatory
	milestone payments to NMS of up to $105.0 million in the aggregate if specified clinical study initiations and regulatory approvals are achieved across multiple products or indications. Pursuant to the December&nbsp;2014 amendment to the agreement,
	we paid the initial milestone payment of $10.0 million to NMS in December&nbsp;2014.

	After the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter.
	An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional
	testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may then issue an approval letter. The FDA has
	committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory

	Fast Track
	Designation
</I>
	. The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and that demonstrate the
	potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after
	the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request.

	approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s review time goal for a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In
	addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

	Accelerated Approval
</I>
	. Under the FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug
	for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be
	measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and
	the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not
	itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or sooner than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the
	completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during
	post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

	improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval.

	Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. The FDA has granted us orphan drug designation for entrectinib for the treatment of neuroblastoma and for the treatment of TrkA-positive, TrkB-positive, TrkC-positive, ROS1-positive
	or ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey
	any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

	The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a
	particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product and for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period,
	the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity, such that it is shown to
	be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among

	The Hatch-Waxman Act:
	Abbreviated New Drug Applications
</I>
	. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#146;s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a
	drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#146;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. A drug listed in the Orange Book may, in turn,
	function as a reference listed drug, or RLD, and be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active
	ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the RLD and has been shown to be bioequivalent through
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	or
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	testing or otherwise to the RLD. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or
	submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their proposed ANDA drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#147;generic
	equivalents&#148; to the RLD, and can be and are often substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the RLD.

	A certification that the proposed ANDA product will not infringe the patents listed for the RLD or that such
	patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant does not challenge the Orange Book-listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking FDA approval of a method of use covered by a patent listed in the
	Orange Book for the RLD, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the Orange Book-listed patents for the RLD have expired.

	If the ANDA
	applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA with respect to one or more patents listed in the Orange Book for the RLD, the ANDA applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder for the RLD and
	the owner(s) of the Orange Book-listed patents for the RLD after the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent owners may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit against the ANDA applicant in response to the notice of the
	Paragraph IV certification. The filing of such a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent,
	settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The ANDA also will not be approved until any
	applicable non-patent exclusivity periods, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, applicable to the RLD have expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following FDA approval of a RLD containing a new active
	moiety, during which time an ANDA for a generic version of the RLD cannot be filed with the FDA, unless the ANDA contains a Paragraph IV certification to an Orange Book-listed patent for the RLD, in which case the ANDA may be filed with the FDA four
	years following the RLD. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA if the RLD contains a previously approved active moiety and the application contained data from
	new clinical studies (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects new drug products that contain a previously
	approved active moiety, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, federal law also provides that periods of patent and non-patent marketing exclusivities listed in
	the Orange Book for a RLD may be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor conducts pediatric studies identified by the FDA in a written request. If such a written request is issued by the FDA, the FDA must grant pediatric exclusivity no later than
	six months prior to the date of expiration of patent or non-patent exclusivities in order for the six-month pediatric extension to apply to those exclusivity periods.

	. Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or

	the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA&#146;s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to
	conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate

	Medical Device Approval Pathways
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A medical device,
	including an
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	diagnostic, or IVD, to be commercially distributed in the United States must receive either 510(k) clearance, de novo approval, or PMA approval from the FDA prior to marketing. There are three classes of medical devices
	recognized by the FDA, Class I (low risk), Class II (moderate risk), and Class III (high risk).&nbsp;Class III devices are those deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices, or devices
	deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device or a pre-amendment Class III device for which PMAs have not been called.&nbsp;Class III devices generally require PMA approval prior to marketing. The PMA approval pathway
	requires that the applicable device demonstrates a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A PMA for an IVD typically
	includes data from preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials. Preclinical data for an IVD includes many different tests, including how reproducible the results are when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at
	multiple laboratories. The clinical data need to establish that the test is safe and effective for the proposed intended use in the indicated population. In addition, the PMA must include information regarding the test&#146;s clinical utility,
	meaning that an IVD provides information that is clinically meaningful. A biomarker&#146;s clinical significance may be obvious, or the applicant may be able to rely upon published literature or submit data to the FDA to show clinical utility.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A PMA also must provide information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. The sponsor
	must pay an application fee to the FDA upon submission of a PMA, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically
	inspect the manufacturer&#146;s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon submission, the FDA determines if the PMA is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and, if so, the FDA accepts the application for
	filing. The FDA then commences an in-depth review of the PMA. The entire process typically takes multiple years from submission of the PMA, but may take longer. The review time is often significantly extended as a result of the FDA asking for more
	information or clarification of information already provided. The FDA also may respond with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that are often expensive and
	time-consuming to generate and can substantially delay approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the review period, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians,
	may be convened to review the PMA application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel&#146;s recommendation is important to the
	FDA&#146;s overall decision-making process.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the PMA is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring
	the applicant&#146;s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable
	criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA approval for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA approval can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to
	ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in an enforcement action, including the loss
	or withdrawal of the approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device,
	its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to the information needed to support the
	proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA. For significant risk devices, the FDA regulations require that human clinical investigations
	conducted in the U.S. be approved via an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence.&nbsp;In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to
	demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IDE is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans.&nbsp;If the FDA disapproves the IDE within this 30-day
	period, the clinical trial proposed in the IDE may not begin.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	IVD trials usually do not require an IDE approval, so long as, among other things, the
	results of the IVD test are not used diagnostically without confirmation of the test results by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. For a trial where the IVD result directs the therapeutic care of patients with cancer, we
	believe that the FDA would consider the investigation to require an IDE application.

<I>
	We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect
	on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its
	entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business,

	We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;We are a
	development-stage company with no approved products, and have generated no material revenue to date and may never generate material revenue or achieve profitability.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a development-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have not generated any material revenue to date and are not
	profitable, and have incurred losses in each year since our inception. Our net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $92.5 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $148.0 million. We expect to continue to
	incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are currently focused
	on the development of our clinical and preclinical development programs, which we believe will result in our continued incurrence of significant research and development and other expenses related to those programs. If the non-clinical or clinical
	trials for any of our product candidates fail or produce unsuccessful results and those product candidates do not gain regulatory approval, or if any of our product candidates, if approved, fails to achieve market acceptance, we may never become
	profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our
	stockholders&#146; equity and working capital.

	We expect to need additional funding to continue our operations, which could result in dilution or
	restrictions on our business activities. We may not be able to raise capital when needed, if at all, which would force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts and could cause our business
	to fail.
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to need substantial additional funding to pursue our
	development programs and launch and commercialize any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, which may include building internal sales and marketing forces to address certain markets.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Even after giving effect to the proceeds received from our common stock offerings and our loan arrangement with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, we expect to
	require substantial additional capital for the further development and commercialization of our product candidates. Further, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to expand our
	ongoing entrectinib and other development programs, including the taladegib development program we acquired from Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, in November&nbsp;2015 and the RXDX-105 and RXDX-106 development programs we acquired from Cephalon,
	Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, or Teva, in March&nbsp;2015, and if we acquire rights to additional product candidates. For example, in September&nbsp;2015 we initiated a new, global Phase 2
	clinical trial of oral entrectinib in adult patients with advanced or metastatic cancer detected to be positive for relevant molecular alterations. We are conducting and plan to initiate additional clinical trials to study our other product
	candidates in the future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant
	commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with our growth, as well as operating as a public company. For example, in October&nbsp;2015
	we signed a new lease for approximately 95,000 square feet of office and laboratory space, and we expect this lease to become effective in the second half of 2016. We may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and
	other unknown factors that may increase our capital needs and/or cause us to spend our cash resources faster than we expect. Accordingly, we expect to need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to continue our operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To date, we have financed our operations entirely through equity investments and the incurrence of debt, and we expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable
	future. We may also seek funding through collaborative arrangements. Additional funding from those or other sources may not be available when or in the amounts needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise capital through the sale of equity,
	or securities convertible into equity, it would result in dilution to our then existing stockholders, which could be significant depending on the price at which we may be able to sell our securities. If we raise additional capital through the
	incurrence of further indebtedness, as we have done under our loan agreement with SVB and under which our ability to incur additional indebtedness is limited, we would likely become subject to additional covenants restricting our business
	activities, and holders of debt instruments may have rights and privileges senior to those of our equity investors. In addition, servicing the interest and principal repayment obligations under debt facilities could divert funds that would otherwise
	be available to support research and development, clinical or commercialization activities. If we obtain capital through collaborative arrangements, these arrangements could require us to relinquish rights to our technology or product candidates and
	could result in our receipt of only a portion of the revenues associated with the partnered products.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On September&nbsp;30, 2014, we entered into an amended and restated loan agreement with SVB, which was
	subsequently amended on June&nbsp;5, 2015, under which we incurred $21.0 million of indebtedness, approximately $11.0 million of which was used to repay our then-existing loan with SVB. In September&nbsp;2015, we borrowed an additional $10.0 million
	under this agreement. We are required to pay interest on the borrowings under the amended and restated loan agreement at a fixed, per-annum rate of 8.6% on a monthly basis through April&nbsp;30, 2016. Thereafter, we will be required to repay the
	principal plus interest in 36 equal monthly installments. The number of months of interest-only payments and the number of months over which the principal will be amortized was each increased by six months upon the consummation of our public
	offering of common stock in June&nbsp;2015. Further, the terms of the amended and restated loan agreement require that we make a final lump-sum payment of 3% of the principal amount of the loans thereunder. We may elect to prepay all amounts owed
	under either or both of the loan tranches prior to the maturity date therefor, provided that a prepayment fee of 1% of the amount prepaid is also paid.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and ability to raise additional sources of cash,
	which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring
	our debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. If we desire to refinance our indebtedness, our ability to do so will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt
	obligations. Additionally, the amended and restated loan agreement contains various covenants, including an obligation to deliver to SVB certain financial and insurance information and comply with certain notice requirements, and covenants that
	restrict our ability, without SVB&#146;s prior consent, to: incur certain additional indebtedness, enter into certain mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions, or incur any non-permitted lien or other encumbrance on our
	assets. Any failure by us to comply with any of those covenants, subject to certain cure periods, or to make all payments under the amended and restated loan agreement when due, would cause us to be in default. In the event of any such default, SVB
	may be able to declare all borrowed funds, together with accrued and unpaid interest, immediately due and payable, thereby potentially causing all or substantial amounts of our available cash to be used to repay our indebtedness or forcing us into
	bankruptcy or liquidation if we do not then have sufficient cash available. Any such event or occurrence could severely and negatively impact our operations and prospects.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified
	personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel, especially Jonathan E. Lim, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, whose services are critical to the successful implementation of our
	business strategies. Further, as our approach is built in part upon the drug discovery and development experience of our scientific &#147;drug hunter&#148; team, which we believe is a significant contributor to our competitive advantage, we are
	dependent on the maintenance and growth of that team with qualified members containing high levels of expertise in specific scientific fields.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are not
	aware of any present intention of any of our executive officers or other members of management to leave our company. However, our industry tends to experience a high rate of turnover of management personnel, and our personnel are generally able to
	terminate their relationships with us on short notice. All of our employment arrangements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. The loss of the services
	of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, financial condition and prospects. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain
	and motivate highly skilled junior and mid-level managers as well as junior and mid-level scientific and medical personnel.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, there is intense
	competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies against which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial
	and other resources, different risk profiles, longer histories in the industry and greater ability to provide valuable cash or stock incentives to potential recruits than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for
	career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we are able to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can
	develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June&nbsp;2013, we received a letter from legal

	technology and certain related claims. We investigated each of those claims and we believe them to be wholly without merit. In August&nbsp;2013, we responded to the letter from Ruga Corporation&#146;s legal counsel, describing the results of our
	investigation and denying each claim made. We subsequently provided certain information to Ruga Corporation&#146;s legal counsel, who has not responded to us. We have received no communication from Ruga Corporation or its counsel since
	September&nbsp;2013. We would vigorously defend any claims that may be pursued relating to this matter.

	In addition, while it is our policy to require
	our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact
	contributes to the development of intellectual property that we regard as our own. Further, the terms of such assignment agreements may be breached and we may not be able to successfully enforce their terms, which may force us to bring claims

	We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional

	international healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the

	A key element of our strategy is to use and expand our product platform to build a pipeline of inhibitors of specific molecular targets, and progress those
	product candidates through clinical development for the treatment of a variety of different types of cancer. Although our research efforts to date have resulted in identification of a series of cancer drug targets, we may not be able to develop
	product candidates that are safe and effective inhibitors of any of these targets. Even if we are successful in building a product pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development for a number
	of reasons, including causing harmful side effects or demonstrating other characteristics that indicate a low likelihood of receiving marketing approval or achieving market acceptance. If our methods of identifying potential product candidates fail
	to produce a pipeline of potentially viable product candidates, then our success as a business will be dependent on the success of fewer potential product candidates, which introduces risks to our business model and potential limitations to any

	Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years
	to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Additionally, any positive results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of a product candidate may not be predictive
	of the results of later-stage clinical trials, such that product candidates may reach later stages of clinical trials and fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having shown indications of those traits in earlier studies. For
	example, although the preclinical and early clinical results for our lead product candidate entrectinib have been promising, those results do not imply that later clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. A number of companies in the
	biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. The results of any future clinical trials we conduct

	We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being
	conducted, by the Data Monitoring Committee for the trial, if applicable, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the
	clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen
	safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we were to
	experience delays in the completion of, or suspension or termination of, any clinical trial for our product candidates, the commercial prospects of the product candidate would be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from the product
	candidate would be delayed or eliminated. In addition, any delays in completing clinical trials would increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize regulatory approval of the product candidate.
	The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.

	Regulatory authorities in
	some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat
	a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for
	the indication for which it receives the designation, then the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity that precludes the applicable regulatory authority from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the
	exclusivity period for the same indication, except in limited situations.

	The FDA and the EMA have granted us orphan drug designation for entrectinib for

	cancer.&nbsp;We expect that we may in the future pursue orphan drug designations for entrectinib in other jurisdictions and/or indications, and for at least some of our other product candidates. Obtaining orphan drug designations can be difficult
	and we may not be successful in doing so. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity may not effectively protect a product from the competition of different drugs for the same indication, which could be approved during the exclusivity period. Further,
	after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA could subsequently approve another application for the same drug for the same indication if the FDA concludes that the later drug is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient
	care. The failure to obtain an orphan drug designation for any product candidates for rare cancer indications for which we seek or receive regulatory approval, and/or the inability to maintain that designation for the duration of the applicable

	the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the sponsor may apply to the FDA for a fast track designation for the product candidate. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before
	the application is complete. This &#147;rolling review&#148; is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. In addition, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval, as
	described below. The FDA has broad discretion over whether to grant a fast track designation and, as a result, even our product candidates that may be eligible for such a designation may not receive it. Even if we were to receive fast track
	designation for any of our product candidates, the designation may not result in a materially faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Additionally, the FDA could withdraw a fast track designation if it

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, we may in the future seek a

	treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and that, as indicated by preliminary clinical evidence, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial

	As with fast track designation, designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we

	measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or sooner than clinical endpoints.
	As with fast track designation and breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA has broad discretion over whether to grant approval based on a surrogate endpoint. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for

	are required to comply with good clinical practices, or GCPs, for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If
	we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in the applicable trial may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials
	before approving a product candidate for marketing, which we may not have sufficient cash or other resources to support and which would delay our ability to generate revenue from any sales of such product candidate. In addition, our clinical trials
	are required to be conducted with product produced in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMPs. Our or our CROs&#146; failure to comply with those regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would

	Agreements governing relationships with CROs generally provide

	substitute CRO, which we may not be able to do on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and the applicable trial would experience delays or may not be completed and would likely increase in cost. In addition, our CROs are
	not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under any agreements we enter with them, we are unable to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical and preclinical programs. If CROs do not
	successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to a failure to adhere to our clinical
	protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, the affected product candidates. As a

	In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain
	healthcare costs. For example, in March&nbsp;2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was passed, which substantially changes the way health
	care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug
	Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount
	program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#146;s outpatient drugs
	to be covered under Medicare Part D.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care
	Act was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction triggered the legislation&#146;s automatic aggregate
	reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional
	Congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.

	Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Middle Class Tax Relief and
	Job Creation Act of 2012 required that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, or CMS, reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule, or CLFS, by 2% in 2013, which
	served as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. In addition, effective January&nbsp;1, 2014, CMS also began bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, on April&nbsp;1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, was signed into law, which, among other things, will
	significantly alter the current payment methodology under the CLFS. Under the new law, starting January&nbsp;1, 2016 and every three years thereafter (or annually in the case of advanced diagnostic lab tests), clinical laboratories must report
	laboratory test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test that it furnishes during a time period to be defined by future regulations. The reported data must include the payment rate (reflecting all discounts, rebates,
	coupons and other price concessions) and the volume of each test that was paid by each private payer (including health insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations). Beginning in 2017, the
	Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test, with some exceptions, will be equal to the weighted median private payer payment for the test, as calculated using data collected by applicable laboratories during the data collection
	period and reported to CMS during a specified data reporting period.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the third quarter of 2015, CMS released the proposed rule governing the Medicare
	Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Test Payment System under PAMA. This proposed rule clarified the methodology by which future reimbursement rates on the CLFS would be calculated. If the proposed rule is implemented as proposed, any significant
	reductions in reimbursement would be phased-in, as CMS would limit the maximum reimbursement reduction for a test up to an annual reduction of 10% for each year beginning January&nbsp;1, 2017, 2018, 2019, and up to an annual reduction of 15% for
	each year beginning January&nbsp;1, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Under the proposed rule, CMS is required to adopt temporary billing codes to identify new clinical diagnostic laboratory tests and advanced diagnostic laboratory tests that do not already have
	unique diagnostic codes, and that have been cleared or approved by the FDA. In addition to assigning the code, CMS must publicly report and explain the payment rate for the tests no later than January&nbsp;1, 2017.

	patents of which we are currently unaware with claims that cover the composition of matter, use or manufacture of our product candidates or the practice of our related methods. Because patent

	parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our product candidates, their use, and manufacture or our related methods infringe one or more claims of these patents. If our activities or product candidates are determined to infringe the
	patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, the holders of such intellectual property rights may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize such product candidates or practice our methods unless we obtain a license

	Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our current or potential licensors. We cannot
	predict if, when or where a third party may infringe one or more of our issued patents. To attempt to stop infringement or unauthorized use, we may need to enforce one or more of our patents, which can be expensive and time-consuming, a significant
	diversion of employee resources, and distract our management. There is no assurance such action will ultimately be successful in halting third party infringing activities, for example, through a permanent injunction, or that we would be fully or
	even partially financially compensated for any harm to our business caused by such third party infringement. Even if such action were initially successful, it could be overturned upon appeal. Even if we are successful in proving in a court of law
	that a third party is infringing one or more of our issued patents we may be forced to enter into a license or other agreement with the infringing third party on terms less commercially acceptable to us than if the license or agreement were
	negotiated under conditions between those of a willing licensee and a willing licensor. We may not become aware of a third party infringer within legal timeframes that would enable us to seek adequate compensation, or at all, thereby possibly losing
	the ability to be compensated for any harm to our business. Such a third-party may be operating in a foreign country where the infringer is difficult to locate, where we do not have issued patents and/or the patent laws may be more difficult to
	enforce. If we pursue any litigation, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensor&#146;s is not of sufficient breath, is invalid, or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the relevant technology on the
	grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. Further, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, which could reduce the likelihood of success of
	any infringement proceeding we pursue in any such jurisdiction. An adverse result in any patent litigation could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our pending
	patent applications at risk of not issuing, which could limit our ability to exclude competitors from directly competing with us in the applicable jurisdictions.

	Certain administrative proceedings may be provoked by third parties before the USPTO and certain foreign patent offices, such as interference proceedings,
	opposition proceedings, re-examination proceedings, inter partes review, post-grant review, derivation proceedings and pre-grant submissions, in which third parties may challenge the validity or breadth of claims contained in our patents or those of
	our licensors. An adverse result in any such administrative proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being canceled or invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our pending patent applications at risk of not issuing, which
	could limit our ability to exclude competitors from directly competing with us in the applicable jurisdictions.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Interference proceedings provoked by
	third parties or brought by us or the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. Derivation proceedings may be brought by us or a third party to
	determine whether a patent or application was filed by the true inventor. An unfavorable outcome in an interference or derivation proceeding could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to use it from the
	prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Litigation, interference, or derivation proceedings may have undesirable outcomes and, even if
	successful, may result in substantial costs, be a significant diversion of employee resources, and distract our management.

	We have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability.
	To the extent we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation
	undergoes an &#147;ownership change&#148; (generally defined as a cumulative change in equity ownership by &#147;5% shareholders&#148; that exceeds 50&nbsp;percentage points over a rolling three-year period), the corporation&#146;s ability to use
	its pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change tax attributes to offset its post-ownership change income and taxes may be limited. We may have experienced an ownership change as a result of our
	October&nbsp;31, 2013 merger transaction, our November&nbsp;2013, March&nbsp;2014, March&nbsp;2015 and June&nbsp;2015 common stock offerings, our March&nbsp;2015 transaction with Teva and our November&nbsp;2015 transaction with Lilly, and we may
	experience one or more ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock. As a result we may be limited in our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income
	that we earn. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $95.5 million and $95.0 million, respectively, that could be limited if the merger, the common stock offerings or the Teva and
	Lilly transactions resulted in an ownership change, or if we experience any other ownership change, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.

	shares of our common stock issued and sold to Lilly in November&nbsp;2015. The registration statement covering the Teva shares has been declared effective by the SEC.&nbsp;Once effective, the resale registration statements permit the resale of these
	shares at any time without restriction, once the contractual lock-up relating to such shares expires in March&nbsp;2016 with respect to the shares held by Teva, or May&nbsp;2016 with respect to the shares held by Lilly. The resale of a substantial
	number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock at times and prices that you feel are appropriate.
	Furthermore, because there are a large number of shares registered pursuant to the resale registration statements, the selling stockholders named in such registration statements may continue to offer shares covered by the resale registration
	statements for a significant period of time, the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to the resale registration statements may continue for an
	extended period of time, and continued negative pressure on the market price of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional equity capital.

	We lease approximately 44,000 rentable square feet of office and laboratory space in San Diego, California with monthly rent payments of
	approximately $114,500. In October&nbsp;2015, we entered into a new lease agreement that provides for us to lease approximately 95,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in two separate buildings in San Diego, California. The lease has a
	ten-year term, which is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2016 once all landlord and tenant-requested improvements to the new facilities are completed. The base rent is initially set at approximately $351,000 per month, although the
	first eight months of base rent will be abated. When we move into this new office and laboratory space, we will move out of our current office and laboratory space, and our current lease will terminate.&nbsp;We believe that our facilities are
	sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.

	On October&nbsp;31, 2013, Ignyta, then known as Ignyta Operating, Inc., merged with and into IGAS Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ignyta,
	Inc., or Parent, a Nevada corporation previously named Infinity Oil&nbsp;&amp; Gas Company and formerly a &#147;shell company&#148; under applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We survived the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary
	of Parent. In the merger, Parent acquired our business and continued our business operations. The merger is accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization, with Ignyta as the acquirer and Parent as the acquired company for financial
	reporting purposes. As a result, the assets and liabilities and the operations that are reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the merger are those of Ignyta and are recorded at the historical cost basis of Ignyta, and the
	financial statements after completion of the merger will include the assets and liabilities of Ignyta and Parent, the historical operations of Ignyta and the operations of the combined enterprise of Ignyta and Parent from and after the closing date
	of the merger. As a result of the accounting treatment of the merger and the change in Ignyta&#146;s business and operations from a shell company to a precision oncology biotechnology company, a discussion of the past financial results of the shell
	company is not pertinent or material, and the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on Ignyta&#146;s financial statements. On June&nbsp;12, 2014, Parent merged with and into Ignyta, with
	Ignyta surviving the merger and changing its name to Ignyta, Inc.

	We are a leading precision
	oncology biotechnology company. Our goal is not just to shrink tumors, but to eradicate residual disease &#150; the source of cancer relapse and recurrence &#150; in precisely defined patient populations. We are pursuing an integrated therapeutic,
	or Rx, and companion diagnostic, or Dx, strategy for treating cancer patients. Our Rx efforts are focused on discovering, in-licensing or acquiring, then developing and commercializing molecularly targeted therapies that, sequentially or in
	combination, are foundational for eradicating residual disease. Our Dx efforts aim to pair these product candidates with biomarker-based companion diagnostics that are designed to precisely identify, at the molecular level, the patients who are most
	likely to benefit from the therapies we develop.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning,
	raising capital, assembling our core capabilities in genetic and epigenetic based biomarker and drug target discovery, identifying potential product candidates and developing such candidates. Our product candidate development operations include
	preparing, managing and conducting preclinical and clinical studies and trials, preparing regulatory submissions relating to those product candidates and establishing and managing relationships with third parties in connection with all of those
	activities. We expect that in the future our operations may also, if regulatory approval is obtained, include pursuing the commercialization of our product candidates.

	We do not track our employee and facility related research and development costs by

	external development costs by program as the majority of our development spend was focused on the development and clinical trials of entrectinib. We have contracted with CROs to manage our clinical trials under agreed upon budgets, with oversight by
	our clinical program managers. Any deviations from the budgets must be approved by us in writing. Our internal research and development costs are controlled through our internal budget and forecast process and subject to quarterly review and

	Research and development activities are central to our business model. Our research and development

	estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development for our programs, or whether any of our product candidates will reach successful commercialization. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, any
	net cash inflows will commence from any of the product candidates we currently or may in the future pursue. This lack of predictability is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing medicines, many of which, such as our
	ability to obtain approvals to market and sell those medicines from the FDA, and other applicable regulatory authorities, are beyond our control, including the uncertainty of:

	This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have

	the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and
	assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time the estimates are made, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the book value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
	sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below, in light of changes in circumstances, facts
	and experience.

	generally cancellable upon reasonable notice and payment of costs incurred. Costs are considered incurred based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks under each contract using information and data provided to us by our
	clinical sites and vendors and other information. These costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects, as well as fees paid to various entities that perform certain research on our behalf.

	We make
	estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Accrued expenses for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are based on estimates of costs
	incurred and fees that may be associated with services provided by CROs, clinical trial investigational sites, and other related vendors. Payments under certain contracts with such parties depend on factors such as successful enrollment of patients,
	site initiation and the completion of milestones. In accruing service fees, management estimates the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If possible, we obtain information
	regarding unbilled services directly from these service providers. However, we may be required to estimate these services based on other information available to us. If we underestimate or overestimate the activity or fees associated with a study or
	service at a given point in time, adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods. Historically, estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred. Subsequent changes in estimates may result

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In January&nbsp;2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, or ASU, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and
	disclosure of certain assets and liabilities in financial statements. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance
	will have on its financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November&nbsp;2015, the FASB issued an ASU which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be
	classified as noncurrent rather than being separated into current and noncurrent components. This new guidance will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
	statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April&nbsp;2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires presentation of debt issuance costs as a direct deduction
	from the carrying amount of a recognized debt liability on the balance sheet, consistent with the treatment of debt discounts. The update does not change the guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. The Company intends to
	adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2016. At the time of adoption, the Company will reclassify debt issuance costs to a liability as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt, consistent with the
	presentation of a debt discount. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	August&nbsp;2014, the FASB issued an ASU that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when
	it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company intends to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of
	fiscal year 2016. Since this guidance is primarily around certain disclosures in the financial statements, the Company anticipates no impact on its financial position or results of operations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May&nbsp;2014, the FASB issued an ASU that supersedes or replaces nearly all revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance establishes a new control-based
	revenue recognition model, changes the basis for deciding when revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time and will expand disclosures about revenue. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to
	adopt this guidance. The Company is evaluating which transition approach to use and its impact, if any, on its financial statements. This ASU is effective for the fiscal year beginning January&nbsp;1, 2019, and early adoption is not permitted.

	We recorded revenue of $150,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. We did not record any revenue for

	Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that
	takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial
	revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of medicines that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will likely need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.

	acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of existing equity holders will be diluted. Also, the terms of any additional equity

	Some of the
	securities that we invest in have market risk in that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the marketable securities to fluctuate. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of
	credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We invest our excess cash primarily in commercial paper and debt instruments of financial institutions, corporations, US government-sponsored agencies and the
	US&nbsp;Treasury. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to ensure liquidity and to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our marketable securities without significantly increasing risk.
	Additionally, we established guidelines regarding approved investments and maturities of investments, which are designed to maintain safety and liquidity.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of the short-term maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable investment securities, we do not believe that an increase in market rates would
	have any significant impact on the realized value of our marketable investment securities. If a 10% change in interest rates were to have occurred on December&nbsp;31, 2015, this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our
	investment portfolio as of that date.

	We have a loan arrangement with SVB under which we have borrowed $31.0 million, and which accrues interest at
	approximately 8.6%. The interest rate is fixed during the loan term and therefore does not subject us to interest rate fluctuation risk.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
	processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
	appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only
	provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
	procedures.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
	management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing,
	our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 at the reasonable assurance level.

	Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
	Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
	generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
	and dispositions of our assets; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and
	expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company&#146;s
	assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of
	achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from
	human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely
	basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this
	risk.

	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
	internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
	we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled &#147;Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework&#148; published by the Committee of
	Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the end of our most recent fiscal year.

	The board believes that Dr.&nbsp;Lim&#146;s service as both chairman of the board and Chief Executive Officer is in the best interest of the company and its
	stockholders. Dr.&nbsp;Lim possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges facing the company and its businesses and is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the board&#146;s time and
	attention are focused on the most critical matters.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although we believe that the combination of the chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles is
	appropriate at this time based upon the current circumstances, our Corporate Governance Guidelines do not establish this approach as a policy. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the board determines the best board leadership structure
	for our company from time to time. As part of our annual board self-evaluation process, we evaluate our leadership structure to ensure that the board continues to believe that it provides the optimal structure for our company and stockholders. We
	recognize that different board leadership structures may be appropriate for companies in different situations. We believe our current leadership structure is the optimal structure for our company at this time.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Dr.&nbsp;Lim&#146;s combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and enhances our ability to communicate our message and strategy
	clearly and consistently to our stockholders, partners and suppliers, particularly during times of turbulent economic and industry conditions. This is expected to be particularly beneficial in driving a unified approach to core operating processes
	as we experience significant growth.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Each of the directors other than Dr.&nbsp;Lim is independent, and the board believes that the independent directors
	provide effective oversight of management. Moreover, in addition to feedback provided during the course of board meetings, the independent directors have regular executive sessions. Following an executive session of independent directors, the
	independent directors communicate with Dr.&nbsp;Lim directly regarding any specific feedback or issues, provide Dr.&nbsp;Lim with input regarding agenda items for board and board committee meetings, and coordinate with Dr.&nbsp;Lim regarding
	information to be provided to the independent directors in performing their duties. The board believes that this approach appropriately and effectively complements the combined Chief Executive Officer/chairman structure.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The responsibility for day-to-day risk management lies with our management; however, our board of directors is responsible for risk oversight as part of its
	fiduciary duty of care to effectively monitor our business operations. Our audit committee, pursuant to its charter, is primarily responsible for overseeing the company&#146;s risk management processes on behalf of the full board. The audit
	committee receives reports from management at least quarterly regarding the company&#146;s assessment of risks. In addition, the audit committee reports regularly to the full board of directors, which also considers the company&#146;s risk profile.
	The audit committee and the full board of directors focus on the most significant risks facing the company&#146;s business and the company&#146;s general risk management strategy, and also ensure that risks undertaken by the company are consistent
	with the board&#146;s appetite for risk. We believe this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing our company and that our board leadership structure supports this approach.

	recommendations. The nominating and corporate governance committee may also review the composition and qualification of the boards of directors of our competitors, and may seek input from industry experts or analysts. The nominating and corporate
	governance committee reviews the qualifications, experience and background of the candidates. In making its determinations, the nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates each individual in the context of our board of directors as a

	nominating and corporate governance committee makes its recommendation to our board of directors. Historically, the nominating and corporate governance committee has not relied on third-party search firms to identify director candidates. The

	Each named executive officer is eligible for a performance bonus that is based 100% upon the achievement of certain corporate performance goals and objectives. Bonuses are set based on the executive officer&#146;s base
	salary as of the end of the bonus year and are expected to be paid out in the first quarter of the following year. The target levels for executive bonuses are currently 50% of base salary for our chief executive officer and 35% of base salary for
	our other named executive officers. Each year our board of directors sets corporate goals and milestones for the year, which generally relate to factors such as clinical and non-clinical development, business development and finance and operations.
	The compensation committee determines the level of achievement of the corporate goals following each year. This achievement level is then applied to each named executive officer&#146;s target bonus to determine that year&#146;s total bonus
	opportunity, with the potential for the compensation committee to exercise discretion in setting final bonus numbers to account for superior or substandard performance of any individual. For 2015, the bonus amounts were based on 120% of corporate
	goals achievement and resulted in bonus percentages of 72%, 42% and 42%, respectively, of Dr.&nbsp;Lim&#146;s, Dr.&nbsp;Bilinsky&#146;s and Dr.&nbsp;Harding Start&#146;s respective annual base salaries in effect during that fiscal year, with
	Dr.&nbsp;Bilinsky&#146;s and Dr. Harding Start&#146;s bonuses pro-rated based on the terms of their service as employees of Ignyta during 2015. For 2014, Dr. Lim&#146;s bonus amount was based on 100% corporate goals achievement and resulted in a
	bonus percentage equal to 50% of Dr.&nbsp;Lim&#146;s annual base salary in effect during that fiscal year.

	Policies Regarding Tax Deductibility of Compensation
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code restricts the ability of publicly held companies to take a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid to certain of
	their executive officers to the extent that compensation exceeds $1.0&nbsp;million per covered officer in any fiscal year. However, this limitation does not apply to compensation that is &#147;qualified performance-based compensation&#148; under
	Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-performance based compensation paid in cash to our executive officers for the 2013, 2014 and 2015 fiscal years did not exceed the $1.0&nbsp;million limit per officer.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While we consider the tax deductibility of each element of executive compensation as a factor in our overall compensation program, the compensation committee
	retains the discretion to approve compensation that may not qualify for the compensation deduction if, in light of all applicable circumstances, it would be in our best interest for such compensation to be paid without regard to whether it may be
	tax deductible.

	In December&nbsp;2013, our board of directors approved a director compensation program applicable to our non-employee directors. That program provided for
	annual cash compensation of $35,000 for each non-employee member of our board of directors. On March&nbsp;10, 2016, our board of directors amended the director compensation program so that this annual compensation amount will be $40,000 beginning
	with the 2016 fiscal year. In addition, our lead independent director, if any, will receive an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000, the chair of our audit committee will receive an additional annual cash retainer of $15,000, the chair of our
	compensation committee will receive an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000 and the chair of our nominating and corporate governance committee will receive an additional annual cash retainer of $7,500. Audit committee members will receive an
	additional annual cash retainer of $7,500, compensation committee members will receive an additional annual cash retainer of $5,000 and nominating and corporate governance committee members will receive an additional annual cash retainer of $3,500.

	shares of common stock as to which a person has sole or shared voting power or investment power and any shares of common stock which the person has the right to acquire within 60&nbsp;days after February&nbsp;29, 2016 through the exercise of any

	person that are currently exercisable or will be exercisable within 60 days after February&nbsp;28, 2016. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our audit committee has established a policy that all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm
	will be pre-approved by the audit committee. Prior to February&nbsp;28, 2014, when our audit committee was formed, our full board of directors had responsibility for the activities that were delegated to the audit committee. All audit and
	permissible non-audit services were pre-approved by our audit committee or board of directors in accordance with this policy during the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. These services may include audit services, audit-related
	services, tax services and other services. The audit committee considers whether the provision of each non-audit service is compatible with maintaining the independence of our auditors. Pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or
	category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget. Our independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the audit committee regarding the extent of services provided by the
	independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
	the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ignyta, Inc.

	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of

	Ignyta, Inc. (&#147;Ignyta&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is incorporated in the state of Delaware and was founded in 2011 (with the name &#147;NexDx,
	Inc.&#148;). The Company changed its name to &#147;Ignyta, Inc.&#148; on October&nbsp;8, 2012. The Company is a precision oncology biotechnology company. Its goal is not just to shrinking tumors, but to eradicate residual disease &#150; the source
	of cancer relapse and recurrence &#150; in precisely defined patient populations. The Company is pursuing an integrated therapeutic (Rx) and companion diagnostic (Dx) strategy for treating cancer patients. Its Rx efforts are focused on discovering,
	in-licensing or acquiring, then developing and commercializing molecularly targeted therapies that, sequentially or in combination, are foundational for eradicating residual disease. Its Dx efforts aim to pair these product candidates with
	biomarker-based companion diagnostics that are designed to precisely identify, at the molecular level, the patients who are most likely to benefit from the therapies it develops.

	On October&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company merged with and into IGAS Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ignyta, Inc., a Nevada corporation previously
	named &#147;Infinity Oil&nbsp;&amp; Gas Company&#148; (&#147;Parent&#148;), formerly a &#147;shell company&#148; under applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;). The Company changed its name to Ignyta
	Operating, Inc. in connection with this merger, and it survived the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. In the merger, Parent acquired the business of the Company and continued the business operations of the Company. The merger was
	accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization, with the Company as the acquirer and Parent as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. As a result, the assets and liabilities and the operations that are reflected in the
	historical financial statements prior to the merger are those of the Company and are recorded at the historical cost basis of the Company, and the financial statements after completion of the merger will include the assets and liabilities of Parent
	and the Company, the historical operations of the Company and the operations of the combined enterprise of Parent and the Company from and after the closing date of the merger. On June&nbsp;12, 2014, Parent merged with and into the Company, with the
	Company surviving the merger and changing its name to &#147;Ignyta, Inc.&#148; (the &#147;Reincorporation Merger&#148;). This Reincorporation Merger had no material impact on the accounting of the Company.

	The Company had negative cash flow from
	operations of approximately $50.8 million during 2015 and, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $148.0 million. The Company is focused primarily on its development programs, and management believes such
	activities will result in the continued incurrence of significant research and development and other expenses related to those programs. The Company expects that it will need additional capital to further fund development of, and seek regulatory
	approvals for, its product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. If the clinical trials for any of the Company&#146;s products fail or produce unsuccessful results and those product candidates do not gain regulatory approval,
	or if any of its product candidates, if approved, fails to achieve market acceptance, the Company may never become profitable. Even if the Company achieves profitability in the future, it may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent
	periods. The Company intends to cover its future operating expenses through cash on hand and through additional financing from existing and prospective investors. The Company cannot be sure that additional financing will be available when needed or
	that, if available, financing will be obtained on terms favorable to the Company or to its stockholders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had
	cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaling $172.1 million. While the Company expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities will enable it to fund its operations and capital expenditure
	requirements for at least the next twelve months, having insufficient funds may require the Company to delay, reduce, limit or terminate some or all of its development programs or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and
	market product candidates that it would otherwise prefer to develop and market on its own. Failure to obtain adequate financing could eventually adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to operate as a going concern. If the Company raises
	additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial dilution to its existing stockholders would likely result. If the Company raises additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash
	payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict its ability to operate its business.

	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and
	related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant estimates used in preparing the financial statements include those assumed in estimating expenses for the Company&#146;s pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, computing the
	valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, calculating stock-based compensation expense and for determining the value of leased property during the construction period for which the Company has been deemed the accounting owner. Actual results could

	Investment securities consist of government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds and commercial paper. The Company classifies its

	The Company evaluates its investment securities as of each balance sheet date to

	securities before the recovery of its cost basis. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are determined based on the specific identification method. No

	determination is based on discussions with the Company&#146;s treasury managers and a review of the Company&#146;s holdings. While the Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities are well diversified

	interest rate risk is minimal. To minimize interest rate risk going forward, the Company intends to continue to maintain its portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities in a variety of securities consisting of
	money market funds and debt securities, all with various maturities. In general, money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. The Company also attempts to

	The Company makes estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in its financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to it at
	that time. Accrued expenses for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are based on estimates of costs incurred and fees that may be associated with services provided by contract research organizations, clinical trial investigational sites, and
	other related vendors. Payments under certain contracts with such parties depend on factors such as successful enrollment of patients, site initiation and the completion of milestones. In accruing service fees, management estimates the time period
	over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If possible, the Company obtains information regarding unbilled services directly from these service providers. However, the Company may be required to
	estimate these services based on other information available to it. If the Company underestimates or overestimates the activity or fees associated with a study or service at a given point in time, adjustments to research and development expenses may
	be necessary in future periods. Historically, estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred. Subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in the Company&#146;s accruals.

	In
	January&nbsp;2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, or ASU, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities in financial statements. This guidance will be
	effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November&nbsp;2015, the FASB issued an ASU which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent rather than being separated
	into current and noncurrent components. This new guidance will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April&nbsp;2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires presentation of debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying
	amount of a recognized debt liability on the balance sheet, consistent with the treatment of debt discounts. The update does not change the guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. The Company intends to adopt this
	guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2016. At the time of adoption, the Company will reclassify debt issuance costs to a liability as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt, consistent with the presentation
	of a debt discount. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	August&nbsp;2014, the FASB issued an ASU that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when
	it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company intends to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of
	fiscal year 2016. Since this guidance is primarily around certain disclosures in the financial statements, the Company anticipates no impact on its financial position or results of operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May&nbsp;2014, the FASB issued an ASU that supersedes or replaces nearly all revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance establishes a new control-based
	revenue recognition model, changes the basis for deciding when revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time and will expand disclosures about revenue. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to
	adopt this guidance. The Company is evaluating which transition approach to use and its impact, if any, on its financial statements. This ASU is effective for the fiscal year beginning January&nbsp;1, 2019, and early adoption is not permitted.

	The Company holds available-for-sale securities that consist of highly liquid, investment grade debt securities. The Company determines the
	fair value of its available-for-sale securities based upon one or more valuations reported by its investment accounting and reporting service provider. The investment service provider values the securities using a hierarchical security pricing model
	that relies primarily on valuations provided by an industry-recognized valuation service. Such valuations may be based on trade prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level&nbsp;1 inputs) or valuation models using inputs that
	are observable either directly or indirectly (Level&nbsp;2 inputs), such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, yield curves, volatility factors, credit spreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for
	the underlying instruments or debt, and broker and dealer quotes, as well as other relevant economic measures.

	Based on the terms of the lease agreement and applicable accounting rules, the Company was determined to bear substantially all of the construction-related

	process) and a corresponding leased facility financing obligation reflecting the estimated fair value of this facility at lease inception (of $10.9 million) and the accumulated build out costs incurred subsequent to the inception of the lease. The
	fair value measurement of the building is categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Upon completion of construction, the Company will occupy the buildings and finalize an assessment of the sale-leaseback criteria to determine whether

	The Company also licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to the topical formulation of taladegib, which is a late preclinical development program for the potential treatment of patients with superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma. In
	February&nbsp;2016, the Company ceased all development activities relating to the topical taladegib program. The Company&#146;s rights under the agreement are exclusive for the term of the agreement. Both parties&#146; rights under the agreement
	include the right to grant sublicenses. The Company is obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize Licensed Products, at its expense. Both parties have a right to terminate the agreement if the
	other party enters bankruptcy, upon an uncured breach by the other party or if the other party challenges its patents relating to the licensed technology.

	shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. The Company recorded a charge of approximately $13.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2015 based on the value of the shares issued for the license from Lilly. The license agreement also requires that
	the Company makes development and sales milestone payments to Lilly of up to $38.0 million. The Company may elect to pay a portion of such amounts by issuing to Lilly shares of its common stock in a private placement, subject to certain conditions.
	In addition, a portion of the $30 million in gross proceeds provided to the Company by Lilly in a concurrent private placement of the Company&#146;s common stock to Lilly (see Note 10) has been earmarked for payment of milestone obligations under
	the license agreement. When and if commercial sales of Licensed Products begin, the Company will be obligated to pay Lilly a mid-single digit royalty of net sales of Licensed Products. When and if commercial sales of Combination Products begin,
	Lilly will be obligated to pay the Company a mid-single digit royalty of net sales of Combination Products. Both parties&#146; royalty obligations are subject to standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent a party is required to obtain any
	rights from third parties to commercialize the applicable products, or in the event of loss of exclusivity or generic competition.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had unused federal and state net operating losses of approximately $92.3 million and
	$91.7 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031. Approximately $1.0 million of the net operating loss carryforwards relate to excess tax deductions for stock compensation, the income
	tax benefit of which will be recorded as additional paid-in capital if and when realized. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company also had federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.8 million and $2.1 million,
	respectively. The federal carryforwards begin to expire in 2031, while the state carryforwards have no expiration. The utilization of the Company&#146;s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject
	to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that have occurred previously or may occur in the future. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the &#147;Act&#148;) limits a company&#146;s ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit
	carryforwards in the event of a cumulative change in ownership in excess of 50% as defined in the Act. These financial statements do not contain any adjustment relating to such potential limitations.
