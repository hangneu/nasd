	This Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report, contains &#147;forward-looking statements&#148;&#151; that is, statements related to
	future, not past, events&#151;as defined in Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that reflect our current expectations regarding our future development activities, results of operations, financial
	condition, cash flows, performance and business prospects, and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Forward-looking statements include any statement that does not directly relate to a

	We are a specialty
	pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, local therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with osteoarthritis, or OA, a type of degenerative arthritis. Our portfolio of
	product candidates addresses the OA pain treatment spectrum, from moderate to severe pain, and provides us with multiple opportunities to achieve our goal of commercializing novel, targeted, locally administered therapies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead product candidate, Zilretta, is a late-stage, injectable, sustained-release, intra-articular, or IA, meaning &#147;in the
	joint,&#148; steroid that we are developing as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe OA pain. We specifically designed Zilretta to combine a commonly administered steroid, triamcinolone acetonide, or TCA, with poly lactic-co-glycolic
	acid, referred to as PLGA, with the goal of providing sustained therapeutic concentrations in the joint and persistent analgesic effect. Zilretta is intended to address the limitations of current IA therapies by providing long-lasting, local
	analgesia while avoiding systemic side effects, which are effects that occur throughout the body as a result of drug that is released from the site of injection into circulating blood. To date, we have completed five clinical trials in which a total
	of approximately 600 patients with OA of the knee were treated with Zilretta. The overall frequency of treatment-related adverse events in these trials has been similar to those observed with placebo and no drug-related serious adverse events have
	been reported. Both the magnitude and duration of pain relief provided by Zilretta in clinical trials have been shown to be clinically meaningful with the magnitude of pain relief amongst the largest seen to date in OA clinical trials.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on the strength of our pivotal and other clinical trials, we believe that Zilretta has the potential to address a significant unmet
	medical need for OA pain management by providing safe, more effective and sustained pain relief. We believe the following attributes uniquely distinguish Zilretta:

	OA is a type of degenerative arthritis that is caused by
	the progressive breakdown and eventual loss of cartilage in one or more joints. Arthritis is the most common cause of disability in the United States and OA is the most common joint disease, affecting 27&nbsp;million Americans, with numbers expected
	to grow as a result of aging, obesity and sports injuries. Recent data suggest that OA accounts for over $185 billion of annual healthcare expenditures in the United States, which does not include loss of productivity costs. We estimate that by
	2030, 45&nbsp;million people will have OA. OA commonly affects large weight-bearing joints like the knees and hips, but also occurs in the shoulders, hands, feet and spine. Patients with OA suffer from joint pain, tenderness, stiffness and limited
	movement. As the disease progresses, it becomes increasingly painful and debilitating, culminating, in many cases, in the need for TJA.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Current therapies for OA are suboptimal, and, because there is no cure for the disease, controlling pain and delaying surgery are the primary
	goals for treatment regimens. Oral drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, including COX II inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, as well as topical NSAIDs, are used to treat early-stage
	OA pain but have limited effect on pain and, given the amount and frequency of use in OA patients, are associated with serious side effects. For example, NSAIDs have shown increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial
	infarction, and stroke. Furthermore, this class of drugs can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines. These serious side effects are particularly worrisome
	because OA patients often have co-existing medical conditions, including diabetes and hypertension. For patients with moderate to severe OA pain, IA medicines, such as immediate-release steroids and hyaluronic acid, or HA, injected into the joint,
	are generally considered well-tolerated, but leave the joint rapidly and fail to produce or maintain clinically meaningful pain relief. For patients who progress to end-stage OA, physicians prescribe opioids, which in addition to the risk of
	addiction and abuse, have numerous serious side effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, constipation, cardiac events and, increasingly, deaths from unintentional overdose. As a result of these suboptimal therapies, many OA patients
	experience persistent and worsening pain, which often culminates in the decision for TJA, a painful and expensive procedure. Further, because the initial joint replacement wears out over time, the younger the patient is at the time of the joint
	replacement, the more likely it is that he or she will require repeat surgery in their lifetime.

	Our projections indicate that by 2030 approximately 23.5&nbsp;million of the 45&nbsp;million OA
	patients will have knee OA. According to IMS Health, each year over seven million OA patients in the United States receive IA steroid injection treatments in the knee, hip, shoulder, hand and foot, with over 3.5&nbsp;million of these being knee
	injections. In 2014, the number of patients that received knee injections of IA steroids increased approximately 7%. We estimate that an additional 1.4&nbsp;million patients received knee injections of IA HA, which the FDA has approved for use only
	in the knee. Despite recent negative guidance related to HA as a treatment for knee OA from specialty societies (e.g. the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI)) and given that
	select payer groups have limited reimbursement for the entire class of HA products, which collectively may begin to put downward pressure on HA sales, HA sales in the United States were approximately $750 million in 2014, with a cost per treatment
	ranging from $500 to $1000. We believe the vast majority of these sales were related to knee therapy. Our clinical trials to date have treated patients with knee OA, which represents the most common joint treated with IA therapies.

	the joint and durable efficacy, and an attractive safety profile with limited systemic exposures and the potential for fewer serious side effects compared to oral OA treatment options.

</I>
	We intend to develop anti-inflammatory and analgesic therapies for the
	treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with OA and post-operative pain. Many OA patients will eventually require IA injection therapies to control their pain as the disease progresses. Currently available IA steroids, none
	of which are formulated for sustained-release, leave the joint rapidly and typically fail to confer pain relief of sufficient magnitude or duration. Since, by medical practice, steroids are not injected more frequently than every three months,
	patients can experience months of pain during that time. While the benefits of HA injections generally last for a longer period of time than steroid injections, they are only marginally more effective than placebo. As a result, we believe there is a
	significant unmet medical need for persistent, effective and safe OA pain relief that can be addressed by sustained-release injection therapies. We have therefore formulated our IA product candidate, Zilretta, with the goal of achieving effective
	drug concentrations in the joint for months, while avoiding significant plasma concentrations of drug that have been linked to systemic side effects. FX007 is being developed to treat post-operative pain and is being formulated to remain in the
	tissues for a sufficient period of time to provide adequate duration of pain relief.

	We seek to mitigate development risk by selecting product candidates with validated mechanisms of action. Each of our
	product candidates also utilizes a unique mechanism of action for achieving analgesia and/or anti-inflammatory effects, which diversifies development risk across multiple targets. In addition, for Zilretta, our sustained-release technology employs
	PLGA delivery systems, which are already used in approved sustained-release drug products outside of OA and in approved surgical devices. Because Zilretta incorporates an already approved steroid in PLGA, it qualifies for the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2)
	NDA pathway under the FDCA, which can be an expeditious, cost-effective means to seek product approval, as well as to potentially expand indications for this product candidate. Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the FDCA enables the applicant to rely, in

	There is no cure for OA. As a result, current treatments are intended to address symptoms of OA,
	in particular, relief of pain and improvement in functional status. The therapeutic regimen for OA becomes increasingly invasive with progression of the disease, culminating, in many cases, in TJA. In addition, because patients are being diagnosed
	with OA earlier in their lives, many patients will require repeat TJAs. Because the decision to have TJA is based in large part on intractable pain and functional impairment, we believe that a new therapy which meaningfully and durably relieves pain

	In early disease, treatment begins with non-pharmacologic therapy including exercise, weight
	control and physical therapy. As the disease progresses, physicians prescribe pharmacologic therapy, beginning with acetaminophen and progressing to oral NSAIDs, including COX II inhibitors, topical NSAIDs or SNRIs. Available oral therapies have
	serious side effects. For example, Cymbalta, a SNRI, may have a role in worsening depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients. In addition to their serious side effects, oral drugs provide limited pain relief and eventually
	become insufficient to control OA pain for many patients as the disease progresses.

	progress to IA HA, a significantly more expensive, but currently reimbursable, therapy with only marginally greater effect than placebo. Triamcinolone acetonide, or TCA, the corticosteroid used in Zilretta, is amongst the most commonly prescribed IA

	Due to severe pain that can no longer be controlled therapeutically, many patients opt to have TJA, which is costly and painful. One of the most prevalent TJA procedures in the United States is total knee arthroplasty.
	Compared to existing drug therapy, total knee arthroplasty is very expensive, with average costs ranging between $25,000 and $50,000, and as many as 30.0% of patients are dissatisfied with the outcome of this procedure. The earlier a patient
	receives TJA, the more likely the patient may need repeat replacement surgery in following years. In 2010, inpatient costs exceeded $13 billion

	Current therapies for OA are suboptimal. Oral drugs, such as NSAIDs, while they may offer adequate analgesia for early-stage OA pain, are
	associated with serious side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular events, and, importantly, are eventually ineffective at managing OA pain as the disease progresses.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	IA therapies, including steroids and HA preparations, are generally well-tolerated but provide pain relief that is insufficient or inadequate
	in duration. All IA steroid therapies approved for OA are immediate-release suspensions or solutions that leave the joint within hours to days and are rapidly absorbed systemically, which may result in undesirable side effects. For example, IA
	immediate-release steroid injections are associated with elevation of blood glucose in diabetics, which can be of clinical concern. While IA steroids demonstrate large initial analgesic effects relative to other therapies, as a result of leaving the
	joint quickly, IA steroids typically fail to confer pain relief of sufficient magnitude or duration. In addition, current standards of care dictate that IA steroid suspensions not be administered more frequently than once every three months. Based
	on internal analysis, we believe approximately 44.0% of patients receiving IA immediate-release steroids are unsatisfied with the duration of benefit.

	Despite U.S. sales of over $750 million in 2014, IA HA therapies, which are approved only for treatment in the knee, produce only marginally
	more effective pain relief than placebo and may have no discernible effect on a patient&#146;s ability to carry out their daily activities. In treatment guidelines for knee OA published in May 2013, the AAOS concluded that current published studies
	do not show any clinically effective response for HA injections. As a result, the guidelines do not recommend HA treatment for symptomatic knee OA for reasons of &#147;&#133;lack of efficacy&#133;&#148; and, most recently, certain insurance carriers
	are no longer providing policy coverage of HA and this may begin to put downward pressure on HA sales.

	For patients with advanced
	disease, opioids are the medicine of last resort. Opioids, however, are associated with significant side effects, particularly when administered chronically. These side effects include serious dependency and abuse potential, respiratory depression,
	hypotension, constipation, cardiac events and, increasingly, deaths from unintentional overdose.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For patients undergoing surgery, control
	of post-operative pain is an important priority. Numerous post-operative pain treatments exist, including local injection of existing drugs at the time of surgical wound closure, opioids, intravenous acetaminophen and NSAIDs and regional nerve
	blocks, but these all have limitations in terms of inadequate magnitude and duration of pain relief, troublesome side-effects, such as increased risk of CV and GI events, or functional impairment.

	In sum, current therapies, for OA pain are inadequate and do not address the desire among physicians and healthcare payors to manage pain for
	longer periods of time, which can delay TJA. In addition, existing pain therapies provide suboptimal post-operative pain relief. As such, we believe there is a significant commercial opportunity for (i)&nbsp;an IA therapy that is well-tolerated and
	can deliver significant and durable analgesia to patients with moderate to severe OA pain, and (ii)&nbsp;a novel therapy that safely provides persistent post-operative pain relief.

	Our
	sustained-release technology allows us to incorporate pharmaceuticals in PLGA microspheres for administration of Zilretta and potentially other product candidates. PLGA is a proven sustained-release delivery vehicle that is metabolized to carbon
	dioxide and water as it releases drug in the IA space and is used in approved drug products and surgical devices. The technology is designed to enable novel formulations of pharmaceuticals by providing controlled, sustained-release of drugs over
	time and the physical properties of the polymer-drug matrix can be varied to achieve specified drug loads and release rates. Key to the success of our IA therapies is the ability to maintain persistent therapeutic concentrations of drug in the
	joint, while minimizing systemic exposure. We believe we are the first company to administer PLGA microspheres into a human joint, and preclinical and clinical data suggest that Zilretta may provide local therapeutic concentrations that could last
	for at least three months and result in very low systemic concentrations of drug. The pharmacokinetic, or PK, clinical trials of Zilretta provide direct evidence that following a single injection, therapeutic concentrations of TCA are maintained
	locally (in the joint) for at least 12 weeks, while very low concentrations of TCA enter systemic circulation. Furthermore, clinical data from our pivotal efficacy trials of Zilretta suggest that following a single injection, Zilretta can provide
	durable local pain relief and functional improvement, while producing very low systemic concentrations and attractive systemic safety profiles. Together these data suggest that the persistent local delivery of Zilretta&#146;s active pharmaceutical
	ingredient from PLGA microspheres has the potential to provide prolonged, local therapeutic effects while reducing the potential for systemic side effects.

	during the duration of the trial. WOMAC is a validated, widely used questionnaire used by healthcare professionals to specifically evaluate the condition of patients with OA of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical function of
	the joints and the KOOS QOL subscale is a validated questionnaire used by healthcare professionals to evaluate the extent to which knee symptoms compromise a patient&#146;s quality of life. The frequency of treatment-related side effects in this
	study was comparable across all treatment arms in the trial. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed and no patients treated with Zilretta were discontinued from the study due to a treatment-related side effect. We intend to present
	detailed results from the trial at a future scientific conference and to submit the results for publication in a journal.

	In September 2015, we reported top-line results from our first pivotal Zilretta study, a Phase 2b
	clinical trial that enrolled 310 patients with moderate to severe OA knee pain. In this trial, 40 mg of Zilretta, compared to placebo (saline), demonstrated statistical significance in average pain relief over weeks 1 through 12 (p = 0.0012;
	2-sided) and over weeks 1 through 24 (p = 0.0209; 2-sided) (see Figure 1). At weekly time points, 40 mg of Zilretta also demonstrated superiority to placebo in pain relief beginning at week 1, continuing to week 11 and also at week 13 (p &lt; 0.05
	at each time point; 2-sided) (see Figure 2). The primary endpoint of the trial, pain relief against placebo at week 12, did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0821; 2-sided) (see Figure 2). However, a pre-specified, commonly applied
	sensitivity analysis, Baseline Observation Carried Forward/Last Observation Carried Forward (BOCF/LOCF), that addresses missing data due to patient dropouts demonstrated statistical significance for the primary endpoint at week 12 (p = 0.042), while
	also demonstrating significance at all time points between weeks 1 and 11 and at week 13 (p&lt;0.05 at each time point; 2-sided) (see Figure 3). Overall, the 40 mg dose of Zilretta performed better than the 20 mg Zilretta dose (see Figure 2). In
	particular, the 40 mg dose conferred more durable pain relief (see Figure 2). The frequency of treatment-related adverse events across the three groups (Zilretta 40 mg, Zilretta 20 mg and placebo) was comparable, and no drug-related serious adverse

	In June 2013, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2b dose-ranging clinical trial of Zilretta,
	which enrolled 229 patients with moderate to severe knee OA pain. In this trial, Zilretta demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in pain relief and functional status relative to commercially available
	immediate-release TCA. Data from this 12-week dose-ranging clinical trial showed that Zilretta had a safety profile that was comparable to the standard of care immediate-release steroid. Patients were injected with 40 mg of immediate-release TCA or
	10, 40 or 60 mg of Zilretta. At the 8-week endpoint, the 40 mg dose of Zilretta demonstrated a statistically (p= 0.01) and clinically significant improvement relative to immediate-release TCA, and analyses of pre-specified secondary measures

	global impression of change and clinician global impression of change also demonstrated statistical superiority. Additionally, the 40 mg dose of Zilretta produced pain relief that was improved at
	weeks 2-12 and statistically superior to immediate-release TCA at weeks 5-10 (p &lt; 0.05 at each time point), and the time-weighted average of pain relief was statistically superior to immediate-release TCA over weeks 1-12 (p=0.04). In summary, the
	extended residency of drug in the joint with 40 mg of Zilretta not only prolonged but also amplified analgesic effect relative to the standard of care. In June 2015, the final study results from this trial were published in the

	We previously completed two PK clinical studies of Zilretta that
	compared the duration of TCA residency in the joint, systemic TCA exposure, and effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, or HPA, axis, which determines the body&#146;s ability to make its own naturally occurring steroids, following a 3 mL
	injection of Zilretta or an injection of the marketed formulation of immediate-release TCA in patients with OA. The data from these clinical trials showed that at 6, 12 and 16 weeks, the Zilretta 40 mg dose groups had measurable concentrations of
	drug in synovial fluid. In contrast, the 40 mg immediate-release TCA dose group at 6 and 12 weeks had concentrations of drug that were below the lower limit of quantitation, which means below the measurement capability of the assay. Data from one of
	these studies also demonstrated that Zilretta reduced systemic TCA exposure and avoided the marked suppression of the HPA axis seen with commercially available steroid suspensions. In sum, these data suggest that IA administration of Zilretta
	prolongs exposure to TCA in the joint and reduces systemic exposure relative to immediate-release TCA in patients with OA.

	earlier PK clinical studies we utilized an injection volume of 3 mL, while in our pivotal Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials we used a 5 mL injection volume. The rationale for the increase in injection volume size was to provide adequate

	double-blind, randomized, parallel group, PoC study, in which, we, as the sponsor of the clinical trial, plan to enroll a total of 124 male and female patients between the ages of 20 and 50 and with moderately symptomatic post-traumatic OA of the
	knee. The primary objective of this study is to assess the analgesic effect of a single IA injection of 40 mg of Zilretta relative to commercially available immediate-release TCA in this population. The primary endpoint is the average change from
	baseline in the weekly mean of the average daily (24-hour) pain intensity scores over weeks 5 to 10. The study is also designed to assess the effect of Zilretta on function, responder status, global impressions of change, stiffness and consumption
	of analgesic medications and to assess the safety and tolerability of a single IA injection of 40 mg Zilretta relative to commercially available immediate-release TCA.

	We expect to initiate a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, single dose design Phase 2 clinical trial of Zilretta in patients with OA of
	the knee who also have type 2 (adult) diabetes during 2016. A total of approximately 36 patients will be randomized, and blood glucose levels will be monitored for a total of three weeks (one week prior to injection and two weeks post injection)
	using a continuous glucose monitoring device. Approximately 20% of patients with knee OA have diabetes and clinical trial data demonstrate that these patients, when treated with IA injections of immediate-release TCA (as well as other
	corticosteroids) can experience substantial elevations in blood glucose levels in the days post injection. These increases in blood sugar coincide with peak plasma concentrations of the injected steroid and are thought to reflect the anti-insulin
	effects of such drugs. Since Zilretta has demonstrated minimized systemic exposures in clinical trials and much lower plasma concentrations than those seen with immediate-release TCA, we believe that administration of Zilretta may avoid elevated
	blood glucose levels. The primary endpoint of this trial is the average blood glucose levels over time from baseline through 72 hours post injection for patients receiving Zilretta compared to patients receiving immediate-release TCA.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	FX007 is
	a small molecule TrkA receptor antagonist that is in development for the persistent relief of post-operative pain. TrkA is the receptor for nerve growth factor, commonly known as NGF, a small peptide that is released following tissue injury. NGF
	binds to TrkA on the surface of pain sensing neurons and renders these cells more responsive to external stimuli. In recent clinical trials of Pfizer&#146;s monoclonal antibody, tanezumab, systemic blockade of NGF demonstrated marked analgesia in a
	variety of painful conditions. Additionally, human genetic studies demonstrated that patients with a mutation in the TrkA gene have congenital insensitivity to pain. These data indicate that interruption of the NGF-TrkA pathway produces a profound
	analgesic effect, and in preclinical pharmacology experiments, FX007 has demonstrated both high affinity for the TrkA receptor and analgesic effects in OA and post-operative pain. Because systemic and persistent blockade of NGF with monoclonal
	antibodies has been associated with rapidly progressive OA requiring TJA, FX007 is being developed for acute, local administration, which has the potential to avoid side effects associated with chronic systemic use.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Post-operative pain is usually most severe in the first few days following the completion of a surgical procedure and is a response to tissue
	damage during surgery which stimulates peripheral nerves that signal the brain to produce a sensory and physiological response. Numerous studies reveal that the incidence and severity of post-operative pain is primarily determined by the type of
	surgery, duration of surgery and the pain treatment choice following surgery.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Unrelieved acute pain causes patient suffering and can lead
	to other complications, which delays recovery from surgery and may result in higher healthcare costs. This is particularly true with respect to post-operative TJA pain, which can compromise rehabilitation and result in poor outcomes. According to
	the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, aggressive prevention of the onset of pain is better than treatment of pain because, once established, pain is more difficult to suppress. Current multimodal therapy for post-operative pain includes
	administration of local anesthetics to the wound combined with the systemic administration of opioid and NSAID analgesics. Opioids are associated with a variety of unwanted and potentially severe side effects, such as respiratory depression,
	hypotension and constipation, and many physicians seek alternatives to opioids for their patients. These side effects may require additional medications or treatments and prolong a patient&#146;s stay in the post-anesthesia care unit and the
	hospital or ambulatory surgery center, thereby increasing costs significantly. The use of injectable NSAIDs, such as ketorolac and ibuprofen, is severely limited in the post-operative period because they increase the risk of bleeding and
	gastrointestinal and renal complications.

	In advance of potential drug approval of Zilretta, we intend to build a commercial infrastructure in the United States to effectively support
	the commercialization of Zilretta. We believe that we can effectively promote Zilretta to the approximately 9,000 orthopedists and rheumatologists who perform more than 75% of OA treatment injections in the United States with a targeted, sales force
	of approximately 60 to 100 representatives. Support for this team will include sales management, internal sales support, distribution support, and an internal marketing group. Additional requisite capabilities will include focused management of key
	accounts such as managed care organizations, pharmacy benefits managers, specialty pharmacies, group purchasing organizations, and government accounts.

	being general practitioners. We believe we can effectively cover all specialties and successfully execute our future commercial plans using a cost-efficient strategy, particularly given that orthopedists and rheumatologists are familiar with IA

	Immediate-release steroids and HA are currently the two marketed classes of IA products that would compete with Zilretta, if approved.
	Immediate-release steroids are generic and widely used as a first line injectable therapy, but leave the joint rapidly after injection and typically fail to confer pain relief of sufficient magnitude or duration. Zilretta has demonstrated in
	clinical trials that it persists in the joint at therapeutic concentrations for at least 12 weeks following injection, whereas there was no measurable immediate-release TCA in the joint by that time. In clinical trials, Zilretta also demonstrated
	clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements compared to with immediate-release TCA in validated OA specific measures. In addition to immediate-release steroids, Zilretta would compete with HA in patients considering something
	beyond an immediate-release steroid injection. The magnitude of pain relief demonstrated by Zilretta in clinical trials to date is much greater than that seen in historic HA clinical trials, in which HA demonstrated only marginal pain relief over
	placebo in knee OA patients, although to date Zilretta has not been evaluated in head-to-head clinical trials against HA. Also on the market are platelet rich plasma injections, but these require on site preparation from blood drawn from the
	patient, have generated questionable efficacy in controlled clinical trials and we believe they are unlikely to be a broadly embraced therapeutic option for OA patients. Because platelet rich plasma is a therapy derived from the individual
	patient&#146;s blood, it does not require and has not received FDA review or approval. For that reason, it is generally not reimbursed by payers and patients must pay out of pocket to receive this therapy.

	The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies for claimed indications as well as descriptions of the
	manufacturing process and controls, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Additionally, the
	results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and the support for dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe
	and effective, are contained in an NDA. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers after the initial submission of a pediatric study plan following an end of Phase 2 meeting unless otherwise agreed upon
	by the FDA and the sponsor. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.

	An NDA may also be submitted under the Fast Track program if the related product candidate has received Fast Track Designation from the FDA
	for the intended indication. The FDA&#146;s Fast Track program was designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to
	address unmet medical needs. Drugs with the Fast Track Designation generally qualify for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of NDA filing, thereby expediting the FDA review process.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for
	filing. Applications submitted under the FDA&#146;s Fast Track program allow companies to submit completed sections of a related NDA on a rolling basis and are subject to the same review and acceptance procedures. Once the submission is complete and
	accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 12 months after submission of an NDA for a new molecular entity in
	which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority review NDA. In addition, the FDA has 10 months after submission of an NDA for a non-new molecular entity in which to complete its
	initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of standard and priority review NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date
	may be extended by additional three month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review
	cycle.

	The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use,
	and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult
	questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA
	is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or
	REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.

	before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations regarding conduct of clinical trials for the product&#146;s trials. If the FDA determines that the application,
	manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.

	The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria
	are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from
	clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA will issue a &#147;complete response&#148; letter if the agency
	decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for
	example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued,
	the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

	If a
	product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may
	require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or REMS to assure safe use of the product through distribution or other controls. In addition, the FDA may require post approval studies, referred to
	as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product&#146;s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In
	the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state government payor programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care
	providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the
	third-party payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication.
	Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic
	studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. In addition, our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or
	cost-effective.

	A third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement
	rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not ensure that other payors also will provide coverage or an adequate reimbursement rate for the drug product. Adequate third party
	reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

	The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical
	industry will continue experiencing pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices
	charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be
	cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S.
	government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and
	requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for
	pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.

	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare
	Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The Medicare Modernization Act expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly by establishing Medicare Part D and introduced a new reimbursement
	methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs under Medicare Part B. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class under the new Medicare
	Part D program. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we receive for any of our approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug
	benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act

	Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our
	business practices with healthcare practitioners, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. Although it is too early to determine the effect of PPACA, the new law appears likely to continue the

	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. For example, on August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget
	Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted
	deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to
	2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, starting in 2013. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for
	the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly,

	We expect that PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be
	adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, as well as additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement
	interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices, including several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, increase drug pricing transparency, review relationships
	between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program drug reimbursement methodologies. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in
	payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.

	In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA,
	including CMS, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of
	Justice, and state and local governments. For example, various activities, including but not limited to sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the
	federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, each as amended. Failure to comply with such requirements could potentially result in substantial penalties to us. Even if we structure our programs with the intent
	of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend against enforcement or litigation, in light of the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in pharmaceutical companies in the United States, and
	some of the applicable laws are quite broad in scope.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity, including a
	prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of business, or the furnishing,
	recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of a good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid program. This statute has been interpreted broadly
	to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others, on the other. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and
	has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at
	less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and strict compliance is
	required. Other practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the
	criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by PPACA, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that
	a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services
	resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person
	who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states
	have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in
	at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors.

	Federal false claims and false statements laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit,
	among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for items or services, including drugs, for payment to, or approval by, a federal healthcare program, including Medicare or
	Medicaid. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any
	monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a
	claim is submitted to any third-party payor and are not limited to claims submitted to a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly
	submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. For example, the False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly
	reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a
	drug&#146;s label), and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third party
	reimbursement of our future products, and the sale and marketing of our future products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be
	subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, the Health
	Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully
	executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any
	materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

	In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal
	government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain &#147;covered entities&#148; (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare
	clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Additionally, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act,
	referred to as HITECH, and its implementing regulations make HIPAA&#146;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#147;business associates&#148;&#151;independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive,
	maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates
	and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#146;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal
	civil actions.

	We may also be subject to various federal and state marketing expenditure tracking and reporting laws, which generally
	require certain types of payments and other transfers of value, among other things, provided to physicians, other healthcare professionals, and healthcare entities in the United States to be tracked and reported. Compliance with such requirements
	may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking and reporting is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of the reported information and relationships. Several states have enacted legislation
	requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or
	register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and prohibiting certain other sales

	seek to have a product covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, various obligations, including government price reporting, are required under the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the
	Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended, which generally require products to be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to such programs and certain purchasers. In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws
	that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors
	have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to
	adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Many of our current as well as possible future activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair

	The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal

	new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. The National MA is for products not falling
	within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If
	the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is
	submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member state, or RMS. If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States

	revenue from product sales. We have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $46.3 million, $27.3 million, and $18.2 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. As of

	rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenue. To date, none of our product candidates have been commercialized, and if our product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized, or if revenue is insufficient
	following marketing approval, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates in the United States, our revenue is also dependent upon the size of the

	Developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products,
	including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, and building and maintaining sales and marketing capabilities, is expensive. We expect our expenses to substantially increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $118.6 million and working capital of $104.0 million.
	Based upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months, including through the
	submission of an NDA for Zilretta, assuming no additional pivotal trials are required. Regardless of our expectations as to how long our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will fund our operations, changing circumstances beyond our
	control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. For example, our clinical trials may encounter technical, enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs more than we expect or the FDA
	could impose additional or different clinical development requirements on us prior to our submission of an NDA for Zilretta. In any event, we may require additional capital prior to commercializing Zilretta or any of our other product candidates.

	Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits
	despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. In addition to the safety and efficacy traits of any product candidate, clinical trial failures may result from a multitude of factors including flaws in trial
	design, dose selection, placebo effect and patient enrollment criteria. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles,
	notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Based upon negative or inconclusive results, we or our collaborators may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or preclinical studies. For example, although
	our Zilretta pivotal Phase 2b clinical trial showed statistical significant pain relief with the 40 mg dose compared to placebo at weeks 1-11 and week 13, the result was not statistically significant at week 12 and therefore the primary efficacy
	endpoint of the trial was not achieved. We believe after consultations with external regulatory advisors that, based on our positive Phase 3 efficacy data, our Phase 2b clinical trial could be considered a pivotal trial by the FDA. However, we
	cannot guarantee that the FDA will accept the Phase 2b trial as pivotal or that we won&#146;t be required to conduct an additional pivotal trial which would delay our NDA submission or approval timeline and result in additional development costs. In
	addition, data obtained from trials and studies are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In any event, our future clinical
	trials may not be successful.

	If Zilretta or any other product candidate is found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we will not be able to
	obtain regulatory approval for it and our business would be materially harmed. If the results of any of our on-going or future clinical trials for Zilretta demonstrate unexpected safety findings or do not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint, the
	prospects for approval of Zilretta, or the commercial potential for Zilretta, if approved, as well our stock price and our ability to create stockholder value would be materially and adversely affected.

	If the FDA does not conclude that Zilretta satisfies the requirements for the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if
	the requirements for Zilretta under Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for Zilretta will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than

	We intend to seek FDA approval through the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2)
	regulatory pathway for Zilretta. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, added Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) to the FDCA. Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at

	likely substantially increase. We may also need to obtain additional funding, which could result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We
	cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the

	been observed in any of our completed clinical trials of Zilretta to date, there have been some AEs assessed as at least possibly related to the study drug. Excluding our recently completed Phase 3 clinical trial, the most common AEs that were

	label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates. For example, we
	believe that, to the extent our clinical development of Zilretta continues to focus on knee OA, any initial indication of Zilretta would be limited to the treatment of knee OA, as opposed to the treatment of OA generally. If an initial indication is
	limited to knee OA, we would likely need to conduct additional clinical trials in order to market Zilretta for other indications and expand its market potential. In addition, we are choosing to pursue an initial approval of Zilretta for single-dose

	We rely upon and plan to continue to rely upon third party CROs to monitor and manage data for our preclinical and clinical programs. We rely
	on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable
	protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with FDA laws and regulations regarding current good clinical practice,
	or GCP, which are also required by the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in the form of International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for all of our products
	in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our
	clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given
	regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. While we have agreements
	governing activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over their actual performance. In addition, portions of the clinical trials for our product candidates are being conducted outside of the United States, which will make it more difficult
	for us to monitor CROs and perform visits of our clinical trial sites and will force us to rely heavily on CROs to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and compliance with applicable regulations, including GCP. Failure to
	comply with applicable regulations in the conduct of the clinical trials for our product candidates may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.

	suppliers may involve substantial cost and could result in a delay in our desired clinical, regulatory and commercial timelines. For Zilretta, we expect that for the foreseeable future we will only seek to qualify Patheon as a commercial supplier
	with the FDA. As a result, if supply from Patheon is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. Any alternative vendor would need to be qualified through an NDA supplement which could result in further delay. The FDA
	or other regulatory agencies outside of the United States may also require additional studies if a new Zilretta supplier is relied upon for commercial production.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of Zilretta or any of
	our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing them successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient on a timely basis and
	at commercially reasonable prices and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue in the event of a product
	stockout if Zilretta or any other product candidate is approved and launched.

	Because developing pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials,
	obtaining regulatory approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products are expensive, we are exploring collaborations with third parties outside of the United States that have more resources and experience. For
	example, we are exploring selective partnerships with third parties for Zilretta development and commercialization outside of the United States. If we are unable to obtain a partner for Zilretta, we may be unable to advance the development of
	Zilretta in territories outside of the United States, which may limit the market potential for this product candidate. In situations where we enter into a development and commercial collaboration arrangement for a product candidate, we may also seek
	to establish additional collaborations for development and commercialization in territories outside of those addressed by the first collaboration arrangement for such product candidate. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval,
	we may enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties with respect to otherwise unlicensed or unaddressed territories outside of the United States. There are a limited number of potential partners, and we expect to face competition
	in seeking appropriate partners. If we are unable to enter into any development and commercial collaborations and/or sales and marketing arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to successfully develop and seek regulatory
	approval for our product candidates and/or effectively market and sell future approved products, if any, in all of the territories outside of the United States where it may otherwise be valuable to do so. For example, although we plan to seek
	partners for the development of FX005, if we are unable to secure a partner, FX005 may not be developed further.

	If we are unable to differentiate our lead product candidate, Zilretta, from existing generic therapies for the treatment of OA, or if

	Immediate-release TCA and other injectable immediate-release steroids, which are the current IA standard of care for OA pain, are available in
	generic form and are therefore relatively inexpensive compared to the price we would expect to receive for Zilretta. These generic steroids also have well-established market positions and familiarity with physicians, healthcare payors and patients.
	Although we believe Zilretta has the potential for clinically meaningful differentiation as compared to immediate-release TCA based on our clinical trial data, it is possible that as we receive data from additional clinical trials, the data will not
	continue to support such differentiation. It is also possible that the FDA, physicians and healthcare payors will not agree with our interpretation of our existing and future clinical trial data for Zilretta. If we are unable to demonstrate
	significant differentiation for Zilretta from immediate-release TCA and other injectable immediate-release steroids, our opportunity for Zilretta to achieve premium pricing and be commercialized successfully, if approved, would be adversely
	affected. For example, although Zilretta, compared to immediate-release TCA, achieved statistical significance through 12 weeks in validated, OA specific pain, stiffness, function and quality of life secondary measures in our recently completed
	Phase 3 trial and was numerically superior at weeks 2 through 12 on the daily pain rating scale, it did not achieve statistical significance in the daily pain rating scale during the course of the trial. As a result, it is possible that healthcare
	payors will not agree with our assessment that Zilretta is sufficiently differentiated from immediate-release TCA to support premium pricing for Zilretta.

	In addition to existing generic steroids, such as immediate-release TCA, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may approve
	generic products that could compete with our product candidates. Once an NDA, including a Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) application, is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a &#147;listed drug&#148; which can, in turn, be cited by potential
	competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. The FDCA, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to
	facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form,
	strength, route of administration, conditions of use, or labeling as our product candidate and that the generic product is bioequivalent to ours, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as our product candidate.
	These generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market and companies that produce generic equivalents

	such as Zilretta will continue to be used primarily after oral medications no longer provide adequate pain relief. To the extent that new or improved oral pain medications are introduced that demonstrate better long-term efficacy and safety,
	patients and physicians may further delay the introduction of injectable therapies such as Zilretta in the OA treatment continuum. Zilretta could also face competition from other formulations or devices that deliver pain medication on a sustained

	Successful sales
	of any approved product candidates depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to
	reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance.
	Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming we obtain coverage for a
	given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high.

	Payors may require documented proof that patients meet certain eligibility criteria in order to be reimbursed for Zilretta, requiring that a

	In

	foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among
	third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide
	scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.

	Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in
	international markets. Third party coverage and reimbursement for Zilretta or any of our other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, or
	may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a
	rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or only available at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product

	We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and
	proprietary know how, and intend to seek marketing exclusivity for any approved product, in order to protect the intellectual property related to product candidates, and to date we have only one issued patent covering Zilretta. The strength of
	patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product
	candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. If this were to occur, early generic competition could be expected against Zilretta and potentially our other product candidates in development. Even if patents do successfully issue,
	third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. Also, a third party may challenge our ownership of patents and patent applications assigned to us, or may challenge
	our exclusive rights to patents and patent applications that we license from third parties. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from
	designing around our claims. If the additional patent applications we hold with respect to Zilretta or our other product candidates fail to issue or if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, it could dissuade companies from
	collaborating with us to develop them and threaten our ability to commercialize any resulting products. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue or whether any issued patents will not be found invalid and unenforceable
	or will go unthreatened by third parties. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market Zilretta or any other product candidate under patent protection could be reduced. Furthermore, patent
	applications by third parties can result in an interference proceeding in the United States being provoked by a third party or instituted by us to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our
	applications. See &#147;Business&#151;Patents and Patent Applications&#148; for additional information regarding our material patents and patent applications.

	In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and
	confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug development process that involve proprietary know-how, information or
	technology that is not covered by patents. For example, we maintain trade secrets with respect to certain of the formulation and manufacturing techniques related to the TCA-formulated PLGA microspheres in Zilretta, including those that relate to
	precise pharmaceutical release. Although we generally require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or
	technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors
	will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner
	as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented
	intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which

	We completed our initial public offering on February&nbsp;18, 2014. As a
	new public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are now subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which
	require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. We have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with the preparation and filing of these
	reports. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, and the Nasdaq Global Market have imposed various other requirements on public companies. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
	Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas
	such as &#147;say on pay&#148; and proxy access. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations,
	which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact (in ways we cannot currently anticipate) the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.
	Moreover, these rules and regulations have and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations have made it more difficult and
	more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage.

	owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company. During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, we completed a Section&nbsp;382 study through

	difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally
	prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder of such corporation for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested
	stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, local therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with osteoarthritis, a type of degenerative arthritis,
	referred to as OA. Our portfolio of product candidates addresses the OA pain treatment spectrum, from moderate to severe pain, and provides us with multiple unique opportunities to achieve our goal of commercializing novel, patient-focused
	therapies. Our pipeline consists of two proprietary product candidates: Zilretta, a late-stage sustained-release, intra-articular steroid, and FX007, a pre-clinical TrkA receptor antagonist for post-operative pain. We retain the exclusive worldwide
	rights to our product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We were incorporated in Delaware in November 2007, and to date we have devoted substantially all of our
	resources to our development efforts relating to our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials with our product candidates, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. We
	do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. From our inception through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of our common stock and convertible
	preferred stock and, to a lesser extent, debt financing. From our inception through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have raised $259.4 million from such transactions, including from our initial and follow-on public offerings. Until such time, if ever, as
	we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt or other financings, government or third-party funding, and licensing or collaboration arrangements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in 2007. Our net losses were $46.3 million, $27.3 million, and $18.2 million for
	the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $139.8 million. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our development
	programs and from general and administrative expenses associated with our operations.

	for Zilretta or one of our other product candidates, which is subject to significant uncertainty. We anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital after FDA approval of Zilretta and completing clinical development of any of our other
	product candidates. Until such time that we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt or other financings, including convertible debt
	financings, government or other third-party funding and collaborations, and licensing arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all, which would have a
	negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our development programs or commercialization efforts or grant to others, rights to develop or market product candidates that we would otherwise
	prefer to develop and market ourselves. Failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations, in part or in full.

	technology transfer from Evonik to Patheon but are currently unable to estimate those costs. In addition, we are currently conducting a future use and impairment analysis of approximately $2.4 million in manufacturing equipment located at the Evonik
	facility. We cannot determine with certainty the duration of and completion costs associated with future clinical trials of Zilretta. The duration, costs and timing associated with the development and commercialization of Zilretta and our other
	product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including uncertainties associated with the results of our clinical trials and our ability to obtain regulatory approval. As it relates to FX007, we will decide how much funding to direct to
	the program on an ongoing basis in response to its preclinical and clinical success, as well as ongoing assessments of the commercial potential of the product candidate. As a result of these uncertainties, we are currently unable to estimate with
	any precision our future research and development expenses for any product candidate, when or if we will achieve regulatory approval, generate revenue from sales of any product candidate or achieve a positive cash flow position.

	Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which
	we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported revenue and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described
	below, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
	making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued and third-party prepaid research and
	development expenses. We base our accrued expenses related to clinical trials on estimates of patient enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites, as well as estimates for services received and efforts expended pursuant to
	contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. We review new and open contracts and communicate with applicable internal and vendor personnel to identify services that have been
	performed on our behalf and estimate the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost for accrued expenses. The majority of our service
	providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed; however, some require advanced payments. For any services that require such advanced payments, we perform a review, with applicable internal and vendor personnel, to estimate the level
	of services that have been performed and the associated costs that have been incurred at each reporting period. We accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contractual amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity
	according to the protocol. We make estimates of our accrued and prepaid expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the
	clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur, or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of
	services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not adjusted our estimates at any particular balance sheet date in any material amount.

	with the expected term (in years) of our stock-based awards, and we expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. The expected term of our stock options has been
	determined utilizing the &#147;simplified&#148; method for awards that qualify as &#147;plain vanilla&#148; options. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free
	interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have
	never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:

	2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses year over year of $14.8 million was primarily due to $10.4 million in Zilretta program expenses related to the previously completed pivotal Phase 2b clinical trial, the
	conduct of the recently completed Phase 3 clinical trial, and manufacturing expenses related to clinical trial and potential commercial supplies. In addition, $4.4 million in personnel and other employee-related costs for additional headcount, stock

	Research and development expenses were $17.9 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
	2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses of $6.9 million was primarily due to year over year increases of $6.0 million in development expenses related to our Zilretta program, $0.4 million related to our FX007
	program, and $1.9 million in personnel and other costs, offset by a year over year decrease $1.4 million in development expenses related to our FX005 program. The increase of $6.0 million in the Zilretta program expenses related to costs associated
	with our pivotal Phase 2b clinical trial and material costs related to this trial and start-up costs for the Phase 3 clinical trial. The increase year over year of $1.9 million in personnel and other costs, including stock compensation and
	consulting expenses, primarily related to an increase in headcount. The decrease year over year of $1.4 million in FX005 program expenses was due to the completion of toxicology and pharmacology studies in 2013. The increase of $0.4 million in FX007
	program expenses was due to an increase in preclinical studies.

	Operating activities used $38.9 million of cash in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The cash used in operating activities in the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 resulted primarily from our 2015 net loss of $46.3 million offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.5 million and non-cash charges of $5.9 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities
	consisted primarily of a $1.6 million increase in our accounts payable, and an increase of $0.4 million in accrued expenses. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily attributable to increased
	expenses related to clinical research and contract manufacturing services. These changes were partially offset by an increase in other assets of $0.5 million. Non-cash charges consisted primarily of $4.6 million of stock-based compensation expense
	and $0.4 million in depreciation expense and loss on disposal of property and equipment and $0.9 amortization and accretion related to our investments.

	Operating activities used $23.1 million of cash in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The cash used in operating activities in the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 resulted primarily from our net loss of $27.3 million for the period, offset by non-cash charges of $3.0 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.2 million. Non-cash charges consisted of $0.5
	million related to depreciation expense and amortization of premiums on marketable securities and $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a $0.5 million increase in our
	accounts payable and a $1.0 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by a $0.3 million increase in our prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of
	our payments to manufacturers, CROs and legal counsel. The $1.0 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily attributable to higher clinical research and contract manufacturing expenses. The increase in prepaid
	expenses and other current assets was primarily due to higher prepaid insurance costs due to becoming a publicly-traded company.

	ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 resulted primarily from our net loss of $18.2 million for the period, offset by non-cash charges of $1.3 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.7 million. Non-cash charges consisted of $0.2
	million related to depreciation expense and amortization of premiums on marketable securities and $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a $0.5 million increase in our
	accounts payable and a $0.3 million decrease in our prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the
	timing of our payments to manufacturers, CROs and legal counsel. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to a $0.1 million decrease in prepaid patent application fees for Zilretta, which were expensed in 2013 when
	the applications were filed, a $0.1 million reduction in interest receivable on our marketable securities, which decreased during the period, a decrease in prepaid expenses related to the conclusion of the Phase 2b dose-ranging clinical trial of
	Zilretta and the refund of a security deposit resulting from our office relocation. The $0.1 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities was primarily attributable to a decrease of expenses related to clinical research and
	contract manufacturing expenses.

	, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
	the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in
	accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously filed. The Company elected to early adopt this standard in the
	year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, accordingly debt issuance costs of $136,446 were deducted from the carrying amount of the debt liabilities at December&nbsp;31, 2015. In accordance with ASU 2015-03, during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we

	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance which supersedes all existing revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific
	guidance. The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive for those goods or services. This guidance will be
	effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this
	guidance and the related transition guidance may have on the Company&#146;s financial statements.

	to continue as a going concern and provides specific disclosure guidance. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company

	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive

	and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
	statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	Flexion Therapeutics, Inc. (&#147;Flexion&#148; or the
	&#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on November&nbsp;5, 2007. Flexion is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, local therapies for the treatment of
	patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with osteoarthritis, a type of degenerative arthritis (&#147;OA&#148;) and post-operative pain. Flexion&#146;s portfolio of product candidates addresses the OA pain treatment spectrum, from
	moderate to severe pain, and provides the Company with multiple opportunities to achieve its goal of commercializing novel, patient-focused therapies.

	The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including, but not
	limited to, new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, and ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Product candidates currently under
	development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional
	capital, adequate personnel infrastructure and extensive compliance reporting capabilities. The Company&#146;s product candidates are all in the development stage. There can be no assurance that development efforts, including clinical trials, will
	be successful. Even if the Company&#146;s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the Company will continue as a going
	concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of December&nbsp;31,
	2015 and 2014, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and long-term investments of $118,603,974 and $151,624,678, respectively. Management believes that current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 should be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. The future viability of the Company is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to finance its operations and to fund increased research
	and development costs in order to seek approval for commercialization of its product candidates. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company&#146;s failure to raise capital as and when needed would
	have a negative impact on its financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategies. This capital is necessary for the Company to perform the research and development activities required to develop the Company&#146;s product
	candidates in order to generate future revenue streams.

	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the
	amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be
	sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
	upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company&#146;s cash equivalents that are invested in
	money market funds are valued based on Level 2 inputs. The Company measures the fair value of marketable securities using Level 2 inputs and primarily relies on quoted prices in active markets for similar marketable securities. During the years
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Amortization and accretion of discounts and premiums are recorded in other income.

	Trust (&#147;2015 term loan&#148;), outstanding under the Company&#146;s credit and security agreements, are reported at their carrying value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company determined the fair value of the term loans
	using an income approach which utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for debt issuances with similar remaining years to maturity, adjusted for credit risk. The term loans were valued using Level 2 inputs as
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014. The result of the calculation yielded a fair value that approximates carrying value.

	term of 45 months. As the term loan had a 15-month interest-only period, the term loan principal balance, along with any accrued interest, was to be paid in 30 equal monthly installments beginning April&nbsp;1, 2014 and ending September&nbsp;1,
	2016. In addition to these principal payments, the Company was required to make a payment of $175,000 to the lender on September&nbsp;1, 2016, which was being accreted to the carrying value of the debt using the effective interest rate method. On
	March&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company paid MidCap $3,236,019, representing the outstanding principal of the debt along with accrued interest as of that date, the $175,000 final payment, a prepayment fee of $30,000 and associated legal expenses to satisfy

	Prior to the debt repayment, the term loan outstanding under the Company&#146;s credit and security agreement with MidCap was reported at its
	carrying value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company determined the fair value of the term loan using an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for debt issuances with
	similar remaining years to maturity, adjusted for credit risk. The term loan was valued using Level 2 inputs as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. The result of the calculation yielded a fair value that approximated carrying value.

	On August&nbsp;4, 2015, the Company entered into a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial Trust, as agent, MidCap Financial
	Funding XIII Trust and Silicon Valley Bank, as lenders, (the &#147;Lenders&#148;), to borrow up to $30,000,000 in term loans, (&#147;2015 term loan&#148;). The Company concurrently borrowed $15,000,000 under an initial term loan. The remaining
	$15,000,000 under the facility may be drawn down in the form of a second term loan at the Company&#146;s option through September 2016, subject to the Company&#146;s receipt of positive Phase 3 Zilretta clinical trial data meeting the trial&#146;s
	primary endpoint which is sufficient to file a New Drug Application (NDA) for Zilretta, as well as other customary conditions for funding. The Company granted the Lenders a security interest in substantially all of its personal property, rights and
	assets, other than intellectual property, to secure the payment of all amounts owed under the credit facility. The Company also agreed not to encumber any of its intellectual property without the Lenders&#146; prior written consent. The Company must
	maintain a balance in cash or cash equivalents at Silicon Valley Bank equal to the principal balance of the loan plus 5 percent for so long as the Company maintains any cash or cash equivalents in non-secured bank accounts. The credit and security
	agreement also contains certain representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company, as well as a material adverse event clause. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company was compliant with all covenants and there were no material adverse
	events.

	final payment equal to 9% of the total principal amounts borrowed under the facility. The final payment amount is being accreted to the carrying value of the debt using the effective interest rate method. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the carrying

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company&#146;s
	Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorized the Company to issue 73,780,250 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. The Company issued Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (collectively, the
	&#147;Convertible Preferred Stock&#148;). Of the 73,780,250 authorized shares, 72,780,250 shares were issued; 55,043,464 of the issued shares were designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;Series A Preferred Stock&#148;) and
	18,736,786 were designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;Series B Preferred Stock&#148;).

	In December 2012, the Company
	issued 17,736,786 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $1.1276 per share (&#147;Series B Original Issue Price&#148;). The Series B Preferred Stock issuance resulted in net proceeds of $19,888,478. Included in the Series B
	Preferred Stock issuance were contingently issuable warrants for the purchase of 218,160 shares of common stock at $0.01 per share. These warrants were contingently issuable if the Company did not initiate and enroll the first patient in a
	multi-dose Phase 2b clinical trial with planned enrollment of at least 100 patients for the Company&#146;s product candidate identified as FX005 by February&nbsp;15, 2014. Additionally, the obligation to issue the warrants would terminate on the
	earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;the consummation of a registered initial public offering, which is defined as a firmly underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering
	the offer and sale of common stock for the account of the Company and (ii)&nbsp;the occurrence of a liquidation event or the consummation of a deemed liquidation event. The Company determined that the contingently issuable common stock warrants were
	equity in nature. As such, the Company allocated the Series B Preferred Stock proceeds to both the Series B Preferred Stock and the contingently issuable common stock warrants based on relative fair values at the issuance date. Given the low
	probability assessed by the Company of not satisfying the contingency and having to issue the warrants, the amount ascribed to the warrants was immaterial and the full amount of the proceeds was allocated to the Series B Preferred Stock.

	On February&nbsp;18, 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) of its common stock. In preparation for the IPO,
	the Company&#146;s Board of Directors and stockholders approved a 1-for-8.13 reverse stock split of the Company&#146;s common stock and a proportional adjustment to the existing conversion ratios for each series of Convertible Preferred Stock. On
	January&nbsp;27, 2014, the Company and holders of a majority of the Company&#146;s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock entered into a Conversion, Amendment and Waiver Agreement. This agreement amended the
	milestone date associated with the contingently issuable common stock warrants from February&nbsp;15, 2014 to February&nbsp;21, 2014. In connection with the closing of the IPO, all of the Company&#146;s outstanding redeemable convertible preferred

	stock-based awards pursuant to the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;2009 Plan), which had similar features to the 2013 Plan. The 2013 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options (&#147;ISOs&#148;), non-statutory stock options, stock

	stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by the board of directors. The maximum number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of ISOs under the 2013 Plan is 4,684,989

	for annual option grants to non-employee directors of the Company whose initial grants vest 25% after one year and monthly thereafter for the next 24 months and whose annual grants vest in equal monthly installments during the 12-month period

	Stock options for the purchase of 403,382 shares of common stock were granted in 2012; of these, 264,944 were granted with performance-based
	vesting conditions to certain executives. The options were to vest in the event of a corporate transaction with the amount to vest contingent upon the transaction. The grant date fair value of these options was $236,940. In September 2012,
	performance-based options for the purchase of 18,450 shares of common stock were forfeited. No expense was recognized related to these options for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 as the performance conditions were not considered probable of
	achievement at December&nbsp;31, 2012. On July&nbsp;16, 2013, in connection with the Company&#146;s proposed initial public offering, the board of directors exercised its election to change the vesting conditions of these stock options from
	performance-based vesting to time-based vesting. As a result, these stock options now vest over a four-year period commencing effective August&nbsp;29, 2012. The change in the vesting conditions was accounted for as a modification of these stock
	options. The modification resulted in an aggregate increase in the fair value of the options of $2,185,729, of which $481,729 was recorded as stock-based compensation expense on the modification date, July&nbsp;16, 2013, and $1,704,000 was
	unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting terms of the options through August 2016.

	The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company
	historically has been a private company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of its publicly-traded peer companies and
	expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. The expected term of the Company&#146;s stock options has been determined utilizing the &#147;simplified&#148;
	method for awards that qualify as &#147;plain vanilla&#148; options. The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S.
	Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect
	to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The relevant data used to determine the value of the stock option grants for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
	approximately $62,423,730 and $56,872,736, respectively, which begin to expire in 2029 for federal purposes and in 2030 for state purposes. In addition, the Company had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of
	approximately $3,593,673 and $2,689,168, respectively, available to reduce future tax liabilities, which begin to expire in 2029 for federal purposes and 2025 for state purposes. Management of the Company has evaluated the positive and negative
	evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards and capitalized research and development expenses. Management has considered the Company&#146;s history of
	cumulative net losses incurred since inception, as well as its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales since inception, and determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not
	realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. As a result, a full valuation allowance has been established at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014.

	Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (&#147;Section 382&#148;), contains rules that limit the ability of a
	company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating losses (&#147;NOLs&#148;) and tax credits existing as of the date of such ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of
	more than 50% of a company&#146;s stock within a rolling three-year period. The rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a
	company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company. During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, the Company completed a Section&nbsp;382 study through February&nbsp;11, 2014. The results of this study showed that
	as of February&nbsp;11, 2014, one historical ownership change within the meaning of Section&nbsp;382 had occurred in 2009. As a result of this Section&nbsp;382 limitation, approximately $0.3 million of NOLs will expire unutilized. In addition, the
	Company completed another Section&nbsp;382 study through December&nbsp;31, 2014. The results of this study showed that the Company experienced an ownership change in 2014 as part of the follow-on offering, however, none of the NOLs will expire due
	to the Section&nbsp;382 limitation associated with the ownership change, assuming sufficient future taxable income and no future limitations. Subsequent ownership changes as defined by Section&nbsp;382 may potentially limit the amount of net
	operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. The Company has generated losses since inception and therefore has recorded no income tax benefits for those losses due to its uncertainty of realizing a
	benefit from those losses.

	In each reporting period, the Company considers whether a tax position of the Company is more
	likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals of litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the tax amount
	recognized in the financial statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. No liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits
	were recorded as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014.

	Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
	within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we

	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control

	officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
	financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
	effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
