	commercialize our product candidate filgotinib, which has completed the DARWIN 1 and 2 trials and still is in the DARWIN 3 trial for RA and reported 10-week data from a Phase 2 trial for CD. Our business and future success also depend on our ability
	to develop successfully, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize our other product candidates, such as GLPG1837, GLPG2222, GLPG1690 and GLPG1972. We initiated Phase 2 trials with potentiator GLPG1837 in Class III mutation

	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. Our product candidates will require additional clinical development, management of clinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions (if regulatory approval can be obtained at
	all), securing sources of commercial manufacturing supply, building of, or partnering with, a commercial organization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before any revenues can be generated from product sales. We are not
	permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or any other comparable regulatory authority, and we may
	never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We cannot assure you that our clinical trials for filgotinib, GLPG1837, GLPG2222, GLPG1690 or GLPG1972 will be completed in a timely manner, or at all, or

	Because we have limited resources and access to

	GLPG1972. Our decisions concerning the allocation of research, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular compounds, product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and
	may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, our potential decisions to delay, terminate or collaborate with third parties in respect of certain product development programs may also prove not to be optimal and could cause us to

	The time required to obtain approval by the FDA, the EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many
	years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary
	to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate&#146;s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing
	product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.

	safety measures that differ from the positions taken in other jurisdictions. For example, in our DARWIN Phase 2 clinical trials for filgotinib in subjects with RA, we agreed with the FDA to exclude the 200 mg filgotinib daily dose for male subjects
	enrolled in the United States pending further data to demonstrate a wider exposure margin in patients versus the safe exposure in animal studies, while there is no such restriction by health authorities outside the United States. We cannot assure
	you that this view will not be adopted by other regulatory authorities in later stage trials or at the marketing authorization stage, if filgotinib successfully completes the registrational trials. Even if filgotinib does receive regulatory approval

	Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time
	during the clinical trial process. Although product candidates may demonstrate promising results in early clinical (human) trials and pre-clinical (animal) studies, they may not prove to be effective in subsequent clinical trials. For example,
	testing on animals may occur under different conditions than testing in humans and therefore the results of animal studies may not accurately predict human experience. Likewise, early clinical studies may not be predictive of eventual safety or
	effectiveness results in larger-scale pivotal clinical trials. The results of pre-clinical studies and previous clinical trials as well as data from any interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates, as well as studies and
	trials of other products with similar mechanisms of action to our product candidates, may not be predictive of the results of ongoing or future clinical trials. For example, the positive results generated to date in pre-clinical studies and Phase 1,
	Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials for filgotinib in RA or Phase 2b clinical trials for CD do not ensure that later clinical trials will continue to demonstrate similar results or observations. Product candidates in later stages of clinical
	trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and earlier clinical trials. In addition to the safety and efficacy traits of any product candidate, clinical trial failures may
	result from a multitude of factors including flaws in trial design, dose selection, placebo effect and patient enrollment criteria. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials
	due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials, and it is possible that we will as well. Based upon negative or inconclusive results, we or our collaboration partners may decide, or regulators
	may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or pre-clinical studies. In addition, data obtained from trials and studies are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may
	delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.

	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and
	pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in
	any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. Any negotiated prices for any of our product candidates, if approved, covered by a Part D prescription
	drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain outside of the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Moreover, while Medicare Part D applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow

	The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of

	In the field of RA, therapeutic approaches have traditionally relied on disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARDS, such as MTX and
	sulphasalazine as first-line therapy. These oral drugs work primarily to suppress the immune system and, while effective in this regard, the suppression of the immune system leads to an increased risk of infections and other side effects.
	Accordingly, in addition to DMARDS, monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, like AbbVie&#146;s Humira, or IL-6 like Roche&#146;s Actemra, have been developed. These biologics, which must be delivered via injection, are
	currently the standard of care as first- and second-line therapies for RA patients who have an inadequate response to DMARDS. In November 2012, Xeljanz (tofacitinib citrate), marketed by Pfizer, was approved by the FDA as an oral treatment for the

	inhibitor called ASP015k which is being developed in Japan by Astellas, and a JAK inhibitor called ABT-494 which is being developed by AbbVie. Filgotinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, was developed in collaboration with AbbVie until AbbVie terminated

	In the field of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, first line therapies are oral (or local) treatments with
	several low-cost generic compounds like mesalazine, more effective in ulcerative colitis, or UC, and azathioprine, more effective in CD. Steroids like budesonide are used in both UC and CD. Companies like Santarus have developed controlled-release
	oral formulation with the aim to have local intestinal delivery of budesonide thereby limiting systemic side effects. For more advanced therapy, monoclonal antibodies with various targets such as TNF and more recently, integrins by vedoluzimab
	(Entyvio) are approved. We are also aware of other biologics in clinical development for these indications, such as: ustekinumab, developed by Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, which is in Phase 3 clinical trials and RPC1063, which is being developed by

	We have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon CROs to monitor and manage data for our pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on
	these parties for execution of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. We and our CROs also rely upon clinical sites and investigators for the performance of our clinical trials in
	accordance with the applicable protocols and applicable legal, regulatory and scientific standards. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and
	applicable legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, and our reliance on CROs as well as clinical sites and investigators does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We, our CROs, as well as the clinical sites and
	investigators are required to comply with current GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable regulatory authorities for all of
	our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, investigators and clinical sites. If we, any of our CROs or any of the clinical sites or investigators fail to comply
	with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.
	We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. We also cannot assure you that our CROs, as well as the clinical sites
	and investigators, will perform our clinical trials in accordance with the applicable protocols as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, or report the results obtained in a timely and accurate manner. In
	addition to GCPs, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. While we have agreements governing activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over the actual performance of our CROs as well as the
	performance of clinical sites and investigators. In addition, significant portions of the clinical trials for our product candidates are and will continue to be conducted outside of Belgium, which will make it more difficult for us to monitor CROs
	as well as clinical sites and investigators and perform visits of our clinical sites, and will force us to rely heavily on CROs to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials in accordance with the applicable protocols and compliance
	with applicable regulations, including GCPs. Failure to comply with applicable protocols and regulations in the conduct of the clinical trials for our product candidates may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory

	Obtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance

	provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain
	requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent

	the patents, covering technology subject to our collaboration or license agreements with third parties. For example, under our collaboration agreement with AbbVie for CF, AbbVie has the right to control prosecution and maintenance of any patent
	rights covering inventions that are jointly discovered or developed by us and AbbVie and patent rights that we control which relate to the compounds or products subject to the collaboration. In addition, in some circumstances, our counterparty has

	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain
	and involve complex legal and factual questions. The interpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering pharmaceutical compositions may be uncertain and difficult to determine, and are often affected materially by the facts and
	circumstances that pertain to the patented compositions and the related patent claims. The standards of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, the European Patent Office, and other foreign counterparts are sometimes uncertain and
	could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Certain U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to
	interference proceedings, and U.S. patents may be subject to reexamination proceedings, post-grant review and/or

	In addition to patent protection, because we operate in the highly technical field of development of therapies,

	with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information
	developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party&#146;s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our

	not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that
	a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets, with
	protection varying across Europe and in other countries. Trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets,

	countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to pharmaceuticals or biotechnologies. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if obtained,

	If we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering
	our product candidate, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace.
	Grounds for a validity challenge include alleged failures to meet any of several statutory requirements in most jurisdictions, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. In the United States, grounds for unenforceability assertions
	include allegations that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in
	the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, e.g., opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in

	We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the
	future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel
	have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be
	more appealing to high quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.

	We expect that if our drug discovery efforts continue to generate drug candidates, our clinical drug candidates continue to progress in

	In particular, our business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar

	directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect
	the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of
	non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these
	prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of our
	employees, agents, contractors, or collaboration partners, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations
	could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance
	programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international

	The rules governing the standards that must
	be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. These stringent standards
	require that our audit committee be advised and regularly updated on management&#146;s review of internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of designing, implementing, and testing the internal control over financial reporting
	required to comply with this obligation. This process is time-consuming, costly, and complicated. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
	reporting beginning with our annual report following the date on which we are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; which may be up to five fiscal years following the date of the completion of our May 2015 global offering. Our management

	Under Belgian
	corporate law, other than certain limited information that we must make public and except in certain limited circumstances, our shareholders may not ask for an inspection of our corporate records, while under Delaware corporate law any shareholder,
	irrespective of the size of its shareholdings, may do so. Shareholders of a Belgian corporation are also unable to initiate a derivative action, a remedy typically available to shareholders of U.S. companies, in order to enforce a right of our
	Company, in case we fail to enforce such right ourselves, other than in certain cases of director liability under limited circumstances. In addition, a majority of our shareholders present or represented at our meeting of shareholders may release a
	director from any claim of liability we may have, including if he or she has acted in bad faith or has breached his or her duty of loyalty, provided, in some cases, that the relevant acts were specifically mentioned in the convening notice to the
	meeting of shareholders deliberating on the discharge. In contrast, most U.S. federal and state laws prohibit a company or its shareholders from releasing a director from liability altogether if he or she has acted in bad faith or has breached his
	or her duty of loyalty to the company. Finally, Belgian corporate law does not provide any form of appraisal rights in the case of a business combination. Please see the section of this Annual Report titled &#147;Item 10.B.&#151;Memorandum and

	Due to its high selectivity for Janus kinase 1, or JAK1, we believe that filgotinib has the potential to offer an improved side effect profile
	and improved efficacy in RA patients as compared to other JAK inhibitors which are less selective for JAK1. Filgotinib has been evaluated for RA in two Phase 2b trials and is currently being evaluated in an ongoing, follow-up trial, which trials we
	refer to collectively as DARWIN. These studies recruited patients with moderate to severe RA who have an inadequate response to methotrexate, or MTX, a common first line treatment for RA. Final results from 24 weeks of treatment in our Phase 2b
	trial for DARWIN&nbsp;1 were disclosed on July&nbsp;29, 2015. Final results from 24 weeks of treatment in our Phase 2b DARWIN 2 trial were disclosed on August&nbsp;10, 2015. In addition, we are conducting DARWIN 3, an ongoing, long-term follow-up

	RA is a chronic autoimmune disease, characterized by inflammation and degeneration of the joints. It affects almost 1% of the adult population
	worldwide, with onset typically between the ages of 30 and 50 years, and with a high prevalence in women. Patients suffer from pain, stiffness, and restricted mobility due to a persistent inflammation of multiple joints, which ultimately results in
	irreversible damage of the joint cartilage and bone. As RA develops, the body&#146;s immune cells perceive the body&#146;s own protein as foreign and cells called lymphocytes react to this protein. The reaction then causes the release of cytokines,

	messengers that trigger more inflammation and joint damage. The inflammation may spread to other areas in the body, ultimately causing not only joint damage but also chronic pain, fatigue, and
	loss of function. Inflammation has also been linked to heart disease and the risk of having a heart attack. RA nearly doubles the risk of having a heart attack within the first 10 years of being diagnosed, according to the American College of
	Rheumatology, or ACR.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The primary goals in the treatment of RA are to control inflammation and slow or stop disease progression. Initial
	therapeutic approaches relied on disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARDS, such as MTX and sulphasalazine. These oral drugs work primarily to suppress the immune system and, while effective in this regard, the suppression of the immune
	system leads to an increased risk of infections. These drugs are also associated with side effects including nausea, abdominal pain, and serious lung and liver toxicities. Further, because these drugs often take an average of 6&#150;12 weeks to take
	effect, rheumatologists may also couple them with over-the-counter pain medications or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to treat the pain and inflammation. Despite these shortcomings, DMARDS are still considered first-line therapies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The development of biologics represented a significant advance in RA treatment. Biologic therapies involve the use of antibodies or other
	proteins produced by living organisms to treat disease. In some people with arthritis, the tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, protein is present in the blood and joints in excessive amounts, thereby increasing inflammation, along with pain and swelling.
	Biologic therapies have been developed to address this overproduction of TNF by disrupting communication between the body&#146;s immune cells. Thus, they block the production of TNF or are designed to attach to and destroy the body&#146;s immune
	B-cells, which play a part in the pain and swelling caused by arthritis. Anti-TNFs are currently the standard of care for first- and second-line biologic therapies for RA patients who have an inadequate response to DMARDS. Since anti-TNF drugs
	function through a suppression of the immune system, they also lead to a significant increase in the risk of infections. In addition, all approved anti-TNFs need to be delivered by injection or intravenously, which is inconvenient and painful for
	some patients, and in some cases self-injection can be particularly difficult for patients who suffer joint pain and damage from RA.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Not
	all patients achieve sufficient clinical response or maintain clinical response to anti-TNFs over time, resulting in a need to switch or cycle to a new therapy to control their disease. Approximately one-third of RA patients do not adequately
	respond to anti-TNFs. In addition, anti-TNFs are associated with low rates of disease remission and the response to these agents is not typically durable. In more than 30% of this population, alternative treatment approaches are needed. A
	significant number of patients treated with an anti-TNF will be cycled to their second and third anti-TNF within 24 months of anti-TNF therapy initiation. Therapeutic cycling is a serious issue for patients because the efficacy of each successive
	drug is not known typically for several months, which contributes to progression of disease and continued irreversible structural joint damage. For RA patients who fail or for whom anti-TNFs are contra-indicated, biologics with distinct mechanism
	and the oral agent JAK inhibitors provide alternative treatment opportunities.

	A growing body of clinical data suggests that the level of
	selectivity of a JAK therapeutic is highly correlated to its efficacy and safety profile. For example, JAK1 is known to interact with the other JAKs to transduce cytokine-driven pro-inflammatory signaling, which leads to inflammation in human
	tissues. Therefore, inhibition of JAK1 is believed to be of therapeutic benefit for a range of inflammatory conditions as well as for other diseases driven by JAK-mediated signal transduction. In contrast, inhibition of the other three kinases
	(JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) may not be required for the anti-inflammatory effect, whereas their inhibition may contribute to side effects. For example, inhibition of JAK2 has been linked to anemia, and inhibition of JAK3 to immunosuppression.
	Non-selective JAK inhibitors have been shown to increase low-density lipoprotein, or LDL. Therefore, we believe the desired efficacy and safety profile of any JAK inhibitor is directly linked to the selectivity of the product.

</SUP>
	(tofacitinib citrate), marketed by Pfizer, was approved by
	the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as the first and only JAK inhibitor for RA approved for commercial sale in the United States. Xeljanz is intended for the treatment of adult patients with RA who have had an inadequate response to, or
	who are intolerant of, MTX. Xeljanz is a small molecule suitable for oral administration and has strong binding affinity for JAK3 and JAK1, and weaker affinity for JAK2. The safety and effectiveness of Xeljanz were evaluated in seven clinical trials
	in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA. In all of the trials, patients treated with Xeljanz experienced improvement in clinical response and physical functioning compared to patients treated with placebo. However, the use of Xeljanz
	has been associated with a range of side effects, including anemia (reduced hemoglobin levels) and elevations in both liver enzyme and lipid levels. For example, in controlled clinical trials for Xeljanz, dose-related elevations in lipid parameters
	(total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, cholesterol, triglycerides) were observed at one month of exposure, including a 15% increase in LDL cholesterol in the Xeljanz 5 mg twice daily arm, the approved dosage in the
	United States. Accordingly, we believe there continues to be a significant unmet medical need in RA and other inflammatory diseases for an orally administered approach with a more favorable side effect profile.

	Moreover, we believe that filgotinib has the potential to be used as a once-daily therapy,

	Filgotinib was evaluated in DARWIN 1 and 2 dose finding trials, Phase 2b trials in patients with moderate to severe RA and who have
	demonstrated an inadequate response to MTX. Patients completing a Phase 2b study had the opportunity to roll-over to DARWIN 3, a long-term follow-up trial that allows patients to remain on treatment. The primary objective of the DARWIN 1 and 2
	trials is efficacy in terms of percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response after 12 weeks of treatment. Final results after 24 weeks of treatment in both of the DARWIN trials were announced in July and August 2015, providing further insight
	as to the safety profile due to the fact the patients are treated for a longer period. Secondary trial objectives include efficacy in terms of the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response at 24 weeks of treatment, ACR50 and ACR70 response
	and other disease activity measures as well as safety and tolerability and effects on subjects&#146; disability, fatigue and quality of life. Filgotinib is being investigated in the United States under our investigational new drug application, or
	IND, that became effective on November&nbsp;30, 2012 for the RA indication.

	The severity of RA can be assessed using several indices as recommended by the ACR. The ACR criteria measure improvement in tender joint

	percentages of clinical response that are known as ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70. An ACR20 score represents a 20% improvement in these criteria and is considered a modest improvement in a patient&#146;s disease. An ACR50 score and ACR70 score represent a
	50% and 70% improvement in the clinical response criteria, respectively, and each is considered evidence of a meaningful improvement in a patient&#146;s disease.

	In
	November 2011, we announced topline data from our Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial (GLPG0634-CL-201), a four-week trial performed in RA patients with insufficient response to MTX alone. This trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
	trial that was conducted in a single center. A total of 36 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to receive filgotinib 100 mg (twice-daily), 200 mg (daily) or placebo, respectively. All randomized patients completed the trial.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the trial, ACR20 at week 4 was achieved by approximately 92% (p-value versus placebo = 0.0094), 75% (p-value versus placebo = 0.0995), and
	33% in the 100 mg (twice-daily), 200 mg (daily) and placebo groups, respectively, and up to 40% of the filgotinib-treated patients went into either disease remission or low disease activity. The difference in number of ACR20 responders at week 4 was
	statistically significant for the pooled filgotinib group versus the placebo group (p-value versus placebo = 0.0067).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	No serious adverse
	events, or SAEs, were reported on patients who received active treatment with various doses and dose regimens of filgotinib and there were also no permanent discontinuations among patients treated with filgotinib. Median laboratory values and
	p-values were visually inspected for trends over time, however, no statistical analysis on trends over time was performed. No clinically relevant trends or changes were apparent from these analyses, except for a decrease in platelet count in both
	filgotinib treatment groups. Vital signs and electrocardiogram, or ECG, parameters were not influenced by filgotinib. Overall, the results of this proof-of- concept trial in patients with RA demonstrated that a daily dose of 200 mg of filgotinib on
	top of MTX shows promising activity and was generally well-tolerated over four weeks of treatment.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November 2012, we announced topline data from our follow-up Phase 2a dose-ranging trial (GLP0634- CL-202) to confirm the safety profile
	observed in the Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial. This trial was a four-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial performed in patients with active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX and was conducted in four
	countries and involved 19 centers. A total of 91 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 allocation ratio to receive once-daily regimens of 30 mg filgotinib, 75 mg filgotinib, 150 mg filgotinib, 300 mg filgotinib or placebo during four weeks,
	respectively.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In this trial, ACR20 by week 4 was achieved by 35% (p-value versus placebo = 0.736), 55% (p-value versus placebo = 0.456),
	40% (p-value versus placebo = 0.834), 65% (p-value versus placebo = 0.111), and 41% for doses 30 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and placebo, respectively. Overall activity of filgotinib was confirmed across a wide panel of parameters. Some imbalances
	among treatment groups in demographic and disease characteristics, as well as the limited size of each treatment group, may explain the relatively high placebo ACR20 response rate and the apparently low ACR20 response rate of the 150 mg/day
	filgotinib dose group. Overall, more consistent and dose-related results across treatment groups were observed for objective measures of disease activity, such as serum C-reactive protein and for physician&#146;s assessment of disease such as SJCs;
	TJCs; and physician&#146;s global assessment, compared with subjects&#146; subjective assessments, i.e., global and pain assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CD is an IBD causing chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract with a relapsing and remitting course. The prevalence estimates
	for CD in North America range from 44 cases to 201 cases per 100,000 persons. In Europe, prevalence varies from 37.5 cases to 238 cases per 100,000 persons, according to a January 2014 GlobalData PharmaPoint report. The disease is slightly more
	common in women, with a peak incidence at the age of 20 to 40 years. The cause of CD is unknown; however, it is believed that the disease may result from an abnormal response by the body&#146;s immune system to normal intestinal bacteria.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The disease is characterized by inflammation that may affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, but most commonly the distal small
	intestine and proximal colon, causing a wide variety of symptoms including anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss. The characteristic inflammatory response of CD is focal transmural inflammation, frequently associated with
	granuloma formation, which may evolve to progressive damage over time.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Treatment of CD will depend on severity of the disease. The main
	goal of treatment is to stop the inflammation in the intestine, prevent flare-ups and keep patients&#146; disease in remission. While mild to moderate symptoms may respond to an antidiarrheal medicine, antibiotics, and other medicines to control
	inflammation, severe symptoms are often treated with anti-TNF agents. Anti-TNF agents, however, do not work for all patients, and, in patients who do find therapeutic benefit, they can lose their effect over time resulting in relapse. Anti-TNF
	agents have also demonstrated side effects arising from long term suppression of the immune system including increased rate of infections. Unlike in RA, few biologics have been approved in CD and, as such, caregivers have a more limited number of
	available treatments.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The market for CD therapies, across the 10 main healthcare markets, was approximately $3.2 billion in 2012 and is
	estimated to exceed $4.1 billion in 2022, according to a January 2014 GlobalData PharmaPoint report, driven primarily by use of anti-TNF agents. The primary existing brands are shown in the table below.

	As with RA, dysregulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway has been associated with CD. Accordingly, we believe that drugs with high
	selectivity for JAK1 and less selectivity for JAK2 and JAK3 are likely to be attractive candidates for development in CD. By inhibition of JAK1 but not JAK2, unwanted effects such as anemia may be prevented. Complications surrounding anemia are of
	particular importance to IBD patients, who frequently experience fecal blood loss. We therefore believe there continues to be a significant unmet medical need in CD treatment for an oral, highly selective JAK1 inhibitor that allows for the efficacy
	benefits of a highly selective JAK1 inhibitor with a more favorable side effect profile driven by less selectivity to JAK2 and JAK3.

	lipid profile with an increase in HDL and no change in LDL, resulting in an improved atherogenic index. An increase in hemoglobin was also observed in FITZROY, without difference between filgotinib and placebo. No clinically significant changes from

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	UC is an IBD-causing chronic inflammation of the lining of the colon and rectum. Unlike CD, UC involves damaging inflammation of only the colon
	and rectum. The disease often presents in young adulthood. In patients with moderate to severe UC the symptoms include frequent loose bloody stools, anemia, abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. UC affected nearly 625,000 people in the United
	States in 2012, according to a December 2013 GlobalData EpiCast report.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The ultimate aim in the treatment of UC is to change the natural
	course of the disease by slowing down or halting its progression, thus avoiding surgery or hospitalization. The current standard treatment for mild-to- moderate UC is 5-aminosalicylates, or 5-ASA. Given either orally or rectally, these drugs work to
	decrease inflammation in the lining of the intestines. For patients who do not respond to 5-ASA, other treatment options include corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biological therapies, such as anti-TNF agents, and cyclosporin. Surgery may be
	necessary for patients with refractory UC. The global market for UC therapies was approximately $4.2 billion in 2012, and is estimated to grow to $6.7 billion in 2022, driven primarily by use of biological therapies, according to a September 2014
	GlobalData PharmaPoint report.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Changes in UC treatment strategies, accompanied by advances in drug development and the addition of
	targeted biological therapies, have greatly improved the outcomes for patients. Although the introduction of anti- TNF agents has changed the treatment of refractory patients dramatically, only one-third or fewer patients will achieve long-term
	remission with such treatment, and many of those patients will eventually lose their response. In addition, anti-TNF agents have known side effects including increased risk of infections. As such, the medical need in this patient segment is still
	considered to be significant.
</P>

	We believe that filgotinib may have potential application in UC. Xeljanz was shown to have a favorable
	efficacy profile in patient trials in UC. Given the higher selectivity for JAK1 of filgotinib, and the hemoglobin improvement shown with filgotinib in multiple Phase 2 patients studies including in CD, filgotinib&#146;s risk/benefit profile may
	prove to be even more attractive than that of Xeljanz in UC patients.

	CF is a rare, life-threatening, genetic disease that affects approximately 80,000 patients
	worldwide and approximately 30,000 patients in the United States. CF is a chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. CF patients, with significantly impaired quality of life, have an average lifespan approximately 50% shorter than
	the population average. There currently is no cure for CF. CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, frequent hospitalizations and ultimately lung transplant, which is life-extending but not curative. In the United
	States, a CF patient on average incurs approximately $50,000 per year, in outpatient expenses alone and substantial additional costs for frequent hospitalizations. Kalydeco, the only approved therapy for the underlying cause of Class III mutation
	CF, adds approximately $300,000 of additional costs per year. Orkambi, the only approved therapy for the underlying cause of Class II mutation CF, adds approximately $259,000 of additional costs per year.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CF is caused by a mutation in the gene for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, protein, which results in abnormal transport
	of chloride across cell membranes. Transport of chloride is required for effective hydration of epithelial surfaces in many organs of the body. Normal CFTR channel moves chloride ions to outside of the cell. Mutant CFTR channel does not move
	chloride ions, causing sticky mucous to build up on the outside of the cell. CFTR dysfunction results in dehydration of dependent epithelial surfaces, leading to damage of the affected tissues and subsequent disease, such as lung disease,
	malabsorption in the intestinal tract and pancreatic insufficiency.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Individuals who carry two copies of a defective CFTR gene, referred
	to as homozygous, are typically affected by CF and show symptoms of the disease. Individuals who carry one copy of a defective CFTR gene are called carriers. Carriers are typically unaffected by CF and show no symptoms of the disease. Individuals
	who carry one copy each of two different defective CFTR genes, referred to as heterozygous, are typically affected by CF and show symptoms of the disease. Today, the majority of CF patients are diagnosed at birth through newborn screening and the
	majority of diagnosed patients have been genotyped, up to 97% in the United States. There are more than 1,900 known mutations in the CFTR gene, some of which result in CF. Mutations in the CFTR gene can be classified into five classes according the
	mode by which they disrupt the synthesis, traffic and function of CFTR, as described in the table below.

	Two of the most prevalent mutations in the CFTR gene are Class II and Class III, including the F508del
	mutation and the G551D mutation, respectively. In Class II patients having insufficient CFTR reaching the membrane, about half of the patient population have the F508del mutation on both alleles, the so-called homozygotes. For clinical trials, these
	patients form a homogenous group. About the other half of the Class II patient population have the F508del mutation on one allele only and carry another mutation on the second allele; they are called the heterozygotes. Also this other mutation
	impairs the correct processing of CFTR. As the group is less homogenous, clinical trials have proven to be more difficult. The F508del mutation is sometimes called a &#147;processing&#148; mutation because it results in a defect in the CFTR protein
	in which the CFTR protein does not reach the surface of cells in sufficient quantities. The G551D mutation, a Class III mutation, is sometimes called a &#147;gating&#148; mutation because it results in a defect in the CFTR protein in which the
	defective CFTR protein reaches the surface of a cell but does not efficiently transport chloride ions across the cell membrane. Most therapeutic approaches under development for CF target the defects caused by one or both of these mutations. Given
	the prevalence of the F508del mutation, a compound that corrects the effect of the F508del mutation can, beside for patients with Class II mutations only, also be used for combination therapy approaches in heterozygous patients with Class I and
	Class III mutations.

	There is no cure for CF, and to date, all but one of the therapies approved to treat CF patients have been designed to treat the symptoms
	rather than address the underlying cause of the disease. The market for CF therapies, across the six main healthcare markets, exceeded $1 billion in 2012 and is to exceed $5 billion in 2018 according to a July 2014 GlobalData OpportunityAnalyzer
	report, primarily driven by introduction of disease modifying treatments. To treat the symptoms of disease, such as CF-associated malnutrition, diabetes, lung disease and systemic inflammation, an aggressive combination of specific therapies is
	required. To address the cause of the disease, the primary focus has been on a class of drugs known as CFTR modulators.

	Kalydeco, marketed by Vertex, is currently the only approved therapy to address the cause of Class III
	mutation CF. Kalydeco is an orally-administered prescription CFTR potentiator for the treatment of patients two years of age and older with CF who have several specific mutations in their CFTR gene, including the Class III (G551D) mutation. Kalydeco
	is designed to keep the CFTR protein channels on the cell surface open longer in order to increase the flow of salt and water into and out of the cell. However, this treatment is limited to the subset of patients who suffer from the Class III and
	other gating mutations of the CFTR gene. Class III mutations occur in only a small percentage of patients with CF (4%).

	In contrast, the

	membrane). Small molecule corrector approaches aim to transport the non-functional Class II CFTR protein to the cell membrane. Lumacaftor (VX-809), which was developed by Vertex, is a small molecule corrector approved for patients with two copies
	(homozygous) of the Class II (F508del) mutation in their CFTR gene for use in combination with Kalydeco. Vertex refers to this combination of lumacaftor and Kalydeco as Orkambi

	We believe that restoration of CFTR function in cellular assays may be predictive of clinical
	outcomes. Specifically, review of Vertex patient and cellular data has shown strong correlation as reflected in Diagram A. In the case of patients with F508del mutation, the administration of Kalydeco and lumacaftor combination resulted in
	approximately 20% restoration of normal, or wild-type, CFTR. The clinical outcome reflected in Vertex&#146;s Phase 3 trial and primary endpoint was that 46% of patients showed an forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1, improvement of
	greater than or equal to 5%. FEV1 levels are a measurement of the volume of air that can be forcibly blown out in one second after full inspiration. Further, as reflected in Diagram B, for patients with G551D mutation, the administration of Kalydeco
	resulted in approximately 30% restoration of wild-type CFTR. The clinical outcome reflected in Vertex&#146; Phase 3 trial and primary endpoint was that 75% of patients showed an FEV1 improvement of greater than or equal to 5%.

	Sometimes called degenerative joint disease or degenerative arthritis, OA, is the most common

	OA will be the fourth leading cause of disability by the year 2020. There is limited data on the total prevalence of OA, but as an example, in the seven major markets in 2014 the diagnosed prevalence of hand OA was over 60&nbsp;million patients. In
	normal joints, a firm, rubbery material called cartilage covers the end of each bone. Cartilage provides a smooth, gliding surface for joint motion and acts as a cushion between the bones. In instances of OA, the cartilage breaks down, causing pain,
	swelling and problems moving the joint. As OA worsens over time, bones may break down and develop growths called spurs. Bits of bone or cartilage may chip off and float around in the joint. In the body, an inflammatory process occurs and cytokines
	(proteins) and enzymes develop that further damage the cartilage. In the final stages of OA, the cartilage wears away and bone rubs against bone leading to joint damage and pain.

	The human genome is made up of tens of thousands of genes which code for the proteins that make
	up the human body. Nearly all chronic diseases and disorders are caused by a disruption in the normal function of certain proteins. The main goal of pharmaceutical companies is to design drugs that alter the activity of these proteins so that normal
	function returns and the cause of the disease is minimized or eliminated. One of the main obstacles in discovering new drugs is to understand exactly which of the body&#146;s thousands of proteins play a key role in a particular disease. Once these
	proteins are discovered, they become targets for drug design. Finding these targets is one of the critical steps in the drug discovery process.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our approach to target discovery is unique as our discovery platform focuses on target identification using primary human cells, which we
	believe provides a good system to study the effect that a protein might have on the disease in the human body. Moreover, we concentrate our efforts on so called &#147;drugable&#148; proteins and utilize high throughput screening technology to
	identify these protein targets in human primary cells. We believe that our discovery approach may increase the chances of success in bringing new mode of action drugs to the market. Since 2009, we have generated 22 pre-clinical candidates, of which
	16 have novel modes of action. Of these, 10 have entered the clinic, seven with novel modes of action.

	In order to study proteins in
	human cells, we take advantage of the distinctive properties of adenoviruses. Adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold and has the capability to infect almost every type of human cell. The adenoviruses we work with have been engineered to
	act as a shuttle vehicle, allowing the delivery of specific pieces of DNA into human cells. Additionally, these viruses have been made replication incompetent, meaning they do not replicate in the human cell they infect, and so do not interfere with
	the processes in the cell. We engineered the viruses to carry small pieces of DNA, specific for individual human genes. When the virus enters the cell, this DNA piece leads to the production of a short sequence of RNA that is processed in the cell
	to become &#147;short interfering RNA&#148; that specifically interferes with the mRNA of the protein it was designed for. By using these viruses, we can cause the cells to block, or &#147;knock-down,&#148; the production of a certain protein,
	mimicking what a small molecule drug does in the human body. We built a collection with these adenoviruses, now in excess of 20,000 viruses, that addresses over 6,000 drugable genes.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our drug discovery research is based on the targets discovered using this technology. Once a target is validated, it is tested against large
	collections of chemical small molecules to identify chemical structures that interact with the target and block or activate protein production. These chemical structures are then optimized to obtain &#147;drug-like&#148; characteristics followed by
	testing of the drug candidate in the clinic.

	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in
	which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the application. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States
	Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed co-owned patent. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of
	the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval.
	In certain foreign jurisdictions similar extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are also available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and country to country basis for each applicable product and depends
	upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.

	Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize
	are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even
	more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions, and enforce our intellectual property rights and more generally,
	could affect the value of intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.

	The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property
	rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the
	patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under
	any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate
	our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can

	In the field of RA, therapeutic approaches have traditionally relied on DMARDS such as MTX and sulphasalazine as first-line therapy. These
	oral drugs work primarily to suppress the immune system and, while effective in this regard, the suppression of the immune system leads to an increased risk of infections and other side effects. Accordingly, in addition to DMARDS, monoclonal
	antibodies targeting TNF, like AbbVie&#146;s Humira, or IL-6 like Roche&#146;s Actemra, have been developed. These biologics, which must be delivered via injection, are currently the standard of care as first- and second-line therapies for RA
	patients who have an inadequate response to DMARDS. In November 2012, Xeljanz, marketed by Pfizer, was approved by the FDA as an oral treatment of adult patients with RA who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, MTX. Xeljanz
	is the first and only JAK inhibitor for RA approved for commercial sale in the United States. We are aware of other JAK inhibitors in development for patients with RA, including a once- daily JAK1/2 inhibitor called baricitinib which is being
	developed by Lilly and expected to be approved as early as 2016, a JAK3/2/1 inhibitor called ASP015k which is being developed in Japan by Astellas, and a JAK inhibitor called ABT-494 which is being developed by AbbVie. Filgotinib, which is a

	In the field of IBD, first line therapies are oral (or local) treatments with several low-cost
	generic compounds such as mesalazine, more effective in UC, and azathioprine, more effective in CD. Steroids such as budesonide are used in both UC and CD. Companies such as Santarus have developed controlled-release oral formulation with the aim to
	have local intestinal delivery of budesonide thereby limiting systemic side effects. For more advanced therapy, monoclonal antibodies with various targets such as TNF and more recently, integrins by vedoluzimab (Entyvio) are approved. We are also
	aware of other biologics in clinical development for these indications, such as: ustekinumab, developed by Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, which is in Phase 3 clinical trials and RPC1063, which is being developed by Receptos and has shown efficacy in a
	Phase 2 trial in UC. There are also several novel oral treatments being explored in Phase 2 and Phase 3, including Pfizer&#146;s Xeljanz. The large number of treatments for UC, and somewhat less for CD, presents a substantial level of competition
	for any new treatment entering the IBD market.

	The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of
	the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is
	subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or
	its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees.

	The FDA
	reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be
	re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an
	NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA
	typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and
	adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what
	conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it
	considers such recommendations when making decisions.

	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the
	applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for
	approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its
	present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA that must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example,
	requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval.

	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for
	use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require
	post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a drug&#146;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been
	commercialized. As part of the NDA, the FDA also may require the submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides,
	physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval,
	a REMS also may be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug.

	compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The
	patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable
	to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application
	for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected
	length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.

	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a
	five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug
	containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA
	submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products
	for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors.
	Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for
	setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular
	indication. Moreover, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels
	sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the
	price and examining the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need
	to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered
	medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level
	of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.

	The U.S. government and state legislatures have
	shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded
	prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug
	products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on
	pharmaceutical companies&#146; share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for

	The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for
	states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#146;s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing
	pharmaceutical manufacturers&#146; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new
	rebate calculation for &#147;line extensions&#148; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory
	definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the
	population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits, to be phased-in by 2014. The Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. In
	addition, the Affordable Care Act provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public
	availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.

	In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to
	entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act
	expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#146;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B

	In the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can
	only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure based on the opinion of the
	Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, a body of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA; and the National MA, which is issued by the competent authorities of the Member
	States of the EEA and only authorizes marketing in that Member State&#146;s national territory and not the EEA as a whole.

	The

	and viral diseases; for veterinary medicines for use as growth or yield enhancers; for medicines derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; for advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-
	engineered medicines; and for officially designated &#147;orphan medicines&#148; (medicines used for rare human diseases). The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for
	products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for products which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. The National MA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the
	Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a

	As is the case in the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant
	regulatory controls. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended, (and which will be replaced from May 2016 or later by Regulation (EU) No 536/2014) provides a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union via
	implementation through national legislation of the Member States. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authorities of the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, a
	clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by
	the Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. A clinical trial may only be undertaken if provision has been made for insurance or indemnity to cover the
	liability of the investigator or sponsor. In certain countries, the sponsor of a clinical trial has a strict (faultless) liability for any (direct or indirect) damage suffered by trial subjects. The sponsor of a clinical trial, or its legal
	representative, must be based in the European Economic Area. European regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of adverse event reports during a study and a copy of the final study report.

	Pursuant to Regulation (EC)
	No.&nbsp;726/2004, as amended, the centralized procedure is mandatory for drugs developed by means of specified biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products, drugs for human use containing a new active substance for which the
	therapeutic indication is the treatment of specified diseases, including but not limited to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, auto- immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, as well as drugs designated as orphan
	drugs. The CHMP also has the discretion to permit other products to use the centralized procedure if it considers them sufficiently innovative or they contain a new active substance or they may be of benefit to public health at the Community level.

	In the marketing authorization application, or MAA, the applicant has to properly and sufficiently demonstrate the quality, safety and
	efficacy of the drug. Under the centralized approval procedure, the CHMP, possibly in conjunction with other committees, is responsible for drawing up the opinion of the EMA on any matter concerning the admissibility of the files submitted in
	accordance with the centralized procedure, such as an opinion on the granting, variation, suspension or revocation of a marketing authorization, and pharmacovigilance.

	The CHMP and other committees are also responsible for providing guidelines and have published
	numerous guidelines that may apply to our product candidates. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of drug products and may include, among other things,
	the pre-clinical studies required in specific cases; and the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long-term efficacy and potential adverse
	reactions. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any of our product candidates.

	Following Article 6(3), first subparagraph, of Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;726/2004, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the
	CHMP under the centralized procedure is 210 days after receipt of a valid application. This period will be suspended until such time as the supplementary information requested by the CHMP, has been provided by the applicant. Likewise, this
	time-limit will be suspended for the time allowed for the applicant to prepare oral or written explanations. When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug which is of major interest from the point of view of
	public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the applicant may request an accelerated assessment procedure. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time-limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, according to
	Article 14(9) of Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;726/2004, but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time-limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.

	If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the product are sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. This is sent
	to the European Commission which drafts a decision. After consulting with the Member States, the European Commission adopts a decision and grants a marketing authorization, which is valid for the whole of the European Economic Area, or EEA. The
	marketing authorization may be subject to certain conditions, which may include, without limitation, the performance of post-authorization safety and/or efficacy studies. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;726/2004, a new marketing authorization
	is valid for five years and may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance after submission of a consolidated version of the initial marketing authorization application in addition to the
	pharmacovigilance data reported and all variations introduced since granting of the marketing authorization. The marketing authorization shall cease to be valid if any marketing authorization granted is not followed by the actual launch of the
	product on the market within three years or, if the product is no longer available on the market for three consecutive years.

	European
	Union legislation also provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;726/2004, as amended, and Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, upon receiving marketing
	authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the
	European Union from referencing the innovator&#146;s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#146;s data
	may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the
	marketing authorization holder, or MAH, obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with
	existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company obtained
	marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical test, pre-clinical tests and clinical trials. However, products designated as orphan medicinal products enjoy, upon receiving marketing authorization,
	a period of 10 years of orphan market exclusivity limited to the therapeutic indication for which orphan designation has been obtained&#151;see also &#147;&#151;Orphan Drug Regulation.&#148; Depending upon the timing and duration of the EU marketing
	authorization process, products may be eligible for up to five years&#146; supplementary protection certification, or SPC, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;469/2009. Such SPCs extend the rights under the basic patent for the drug.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the European Union, the pricing and reimbursement mechanisms by private and public health insurers vary largely by country and even
	within countries. The public systems reimbursement for standard drugs is determined by guidelines established by the legislator or responsible national authority. The approach taken varies by Member State. Some jurisdictions operate positive and
	negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict
	reimbursement. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products and some of EU countries require
	the completion of studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan drugs.
	Inclusion of orphan drugs in reimbursement systems tend to focus on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any drug. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come
	with cost, use and often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country. In addition, results based rules of reimbursement may apply.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the discovery and development of small molecule medicines with novel modes of
	action, addressing disease areas of high unmet medical need. Our lead programs include filgotinib, for which our collaboration partner Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, plans to start Phase 3 trials in rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, and Crohn&#146;s
	disease, or CD, this year; GLPG1837, for which we started a Phase 2 program in February 2016 in certain mutations of cystic fibrosis, or CF; GLPG1690, for which we expect to begin a Phase 2a trial for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, in the
	near future; GLPG2222, for which we initiated a Phase 1 study in January 2016;GLPG1972, for which we initiated a Phase 1 first-in-human study in November 2015, and a series of novel potentiators and correctors for CF in pre-clinical stages. In
	February 2012, we signed a collaboration agreement for filgotinib with Abbott (now AbbVie). In September 2015, AbbVie notified us of the termination of such collaboration agreement, following which, we regained all unencumbered rights to filgotinib.
	In December 2015, we entered into a global collaboration with Gilead for the development and commercialization of filgotinib for inflammatory indications. Our CF program is a joint research and development, or R&amp;D, alliance with AbbVie. Our
	GLPG1972 osteoarthritis, or OA, program is a joint R&amp;D alliance with Servier.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We devote substantially all of our resources to our
	drug discovery efforts from target discovery through to clinical development. To date, we do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We sold our service division to Charles River Laboratories
	International, Inc., or Charles River, on April&nbsp;1, 2014. As a result, the service division has been reported under discontinued operations, although certain entities of the service division were not sold and are therefore still reported under
	continuing operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To date, we funded our operations through public and private placements of equity securities, upfront and
	milestone payments received from pharmaceutical partners under our collaboration and alliance agreements, payments under our fee-for-service contracts, funding from governmental bodies, interest income as well as the net proceeds from the sale of
	our service division. From January&nbsp;1, 2013 until December&nbsp;31, 2015, we raised net proceeds of &#128;312.2&nbsp;million from a private placement of ordinary shares in April 2013, as well as from a global offering of ordinary shares in May
	2015, and we also received &#128;117.4&nbsp;million in payments through our collaboration and alliance agreements. These are non-recurring items which have a significant impact upon the profitability or cash flow of our business in each year in
	which they are received and earned. Fee-for-service payments and payments from governmental bodies contributed &#128;12.2&nbsp;million and &#128;33.5&nbsp;million, respectively. Over the same period, we also received &#128;3.4&nbsp;million in
	interest payments. In April 2014, the sale of our service division generated net proceeds of &#128;130.8 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of &#128;340.3 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we incurred a net loss of &#128;8.1 million. Due to the sale of the service division, we realized a
	net income of &#128;33.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we incurred a net loss of &#128;118.4 million. Excluding the impact of possible upfront and in-licensing payments we may
	receive from our collaborations, we forecast to continue incurring losses as we continue to invest in our clinical and pre-clinical development programs and our discovery platform.

	In September 2013, we entered into a global collaboration agreement with AbbVie focused on the discovery and worldwide development and
	commercialization of potentiator and corrector molecules for the treatment of CF. A detailed summary of this collaboration agreement is set forth in the section of this Annual Report titled &#147;Item 4.B.&#151;Business

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon execution of the collaboration agreement,
	we received a one-time non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment of $45.0 million (&#128;34.0 million), which has been fully recognized as of June 2015. In December 2014, we initiated a Phase 1 trial for GLPG1837 for which we received a
	milestone payment of $10.0 million (&#128;8.0 million). In November 2015, we initiated a Phase 1 trial for GLPG2222, for which we received a $10.0 million (&#128;8.0 million) payment from AbbVie in January 2016. All payments by AbbVie to us are made
	in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $340 million in total additional developmental, regulatory, and
	sales-based milestones. In addition, we will be eligible to receive tiered royalty percentages ranging from the mid-teens to 20% on net sales of licensed products payable on a product-by-product basis. In the event we exercise our co-promotion
	option with respect to a licensed product, we would assume a portion of the co-promotion effort in The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg and share in the net profit and net losses in these territories instead of receiving royalties in those
	territories during the period of co-promotion.

	certain circumstances. Our right to receive royalties under the collaboration agreement continues, on a country-by-country basis, until the later to occur of certain specified events. In the event we exercise our co-promotion option with respect to
	licensed products in one or more of the territories eligible for co-promotion, we would assume a portion of the co-promotion effort in The United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, Belgium, and/or Luxembourg and share equally

	Non-refundable, upfront

	and cost to complete the project phase and adjust the time period over which the revenue is deferred accordingly.

	&#128;99.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 to &#128;129.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The increase is driven by the maturing pipeline of our R&amp;D projects. As progressively drug candidate
	compounds have been entering the clinic, costs for development of these molecules increased as well, specifically with regard to third-party CRO costs for conducting these clinical trials. Our program filgotinib for RA accounts for 26% of the

	As a company that carries out extensive R&amp;D activities, we, as a Belgian
	company, benefit from the patent income deduction, or PID, tax incentive. The PID allows a deduction of 80% of qualifying gross patent income from the taxable basis, resulting in an effective tax rate of a maximum 6.8% on this income. This income
	will come from eligible patents, which are self-developed in our Belgian or foreign R&amp;D centers. We expect that future license payments with regard to eligible patents such as milestone payments, upfront fees, turnover of patented products and
	royalties will benefit from this PID and hence will be taxed at this favorable rate.

	shall be classified as an equity instrument or as a derivative financial asset of our company. IAS 32 requires that for a derivative to meet the definition of equity it must be settled only by the issuer exchanging a &#147;fixed amount of cash or
	another financial asset for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.&#148; Because the
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	commitment by Gilead was made in U.S. dollars, the actual number of shares finally issued by us
	varied with the fluctuation in the $/&#128; exchange rate until the settlement date on January&nbsp;19, 2016.

	connection with a collaboration agreement) to several elements included in an agreement, and the determination of whether the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer. Collaboration agreements are reviewed carefully to
	understand the nature of risks and rewards of the arrangement. All of our revenue-generating transactions have been subject to such evaluation by management.

	Accruals are prepared separately for each clinical trial in progress and take into consideration the stage of completion of each trial including the number of patients that have entered the trial and whether we have received the final report. In all
	cases, the full cost of each trial is expensed by the time we have received the final report. There have not been any material adjustments to estimates based on the actual costs incurred for each period presented.

	explained by an enlarged workforce, higher warrant costs and a higher provision for short-term and long-term management bonus, mainly as a result of the evolution of our share price change relative to the Next Biotech Index on Euronext. Increased

	2014 and increased by &#128;5.2&nbsp;million, or 38%, to &#128;19.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. This increase was principally due to personnel costs and directors fees, which increased by &#128;4.6&nbsp;million, or 58%,
	from &#128;8.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 to &#128;12.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, resulting from various effects, such as increased costs of share-based payments plans (warrant plans) and
	increased provision for short- and long-term management bonus, mainly as a result of the evolution of our share price change relative to the Next Biotech Index on Euronext. In addition, other operating expenses increased by &#128;0.6&nbsp;million,
	or 10%, from &#128;5.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 to &#128;6.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, mainly due to higher professional fees.

	On December&nbsp;16, 2015, we entered into a global collaboration for the development and
	commercialization of filgotinib with Gilead, in the framework of which Gilead committed to an upfront payment of $725 million consisting of a license fee of $300 million and a $425 million equity investment in our company by subscribing to new
	shares at a price of &#128;58&nbsp;per share, including issuance premium. This agreement was effectively completed and entered into force on January&nbsp;19, 2016 and the full payment was received.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the agreement, we recognized a deferred income and an offsetting short-term financial asset (derivative) of
	&#128;39&nbsp;million upon signing of the share subscription agreement with Gilead as required under IAS 39. This financial asset initially reflects the share premium that Gilead committed to pay above our closing share price on the day of entering
	into the subscription agreement. Under IAS 39 the fair value of the financial asset is re-measured at year-end and again upon entering into force of the share subscription agreement on January&nbsp;19, 2016, when the financial asset expired.
	Variations in fair value of the financial asset are recorded in the income statement included in our consolidated financial statements appended to this Annual Report.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The decrease in the fair value of the financial asset resulting from the increase in our share price between signing of the subscription
	agreement and December&nbsp;31, 2015 resulted in a negative, non-cash adjustment fair value charge of &#128;30.6&nbsp;million in the financial results. The subsequent increase in the fair value of the financial asset resulting from the decrease in
	our share price between January&nbsp;1, 2016 and January&nbsp;19, 2016 will result in a positive non-cash gain of &#128;57.5&nbsp;million in the financial result of the first quarter of 2016.

	Under the AbbVie RA and CD collaboration agreement, we received one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payments in the
	amount of $150 million (&#128;111.6 million) in March 2012 and $20 million (&#128;15.6 million) in connection with the first amendment to the collaboration agreement in May 2013. At inception and as of December&nbsp;31, 2012, the period of
	involvement was estimated at 30 months starting in March 2012. As from April 2013 and as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we changed the estimate of our period of involvement to 34 months due to delays that occurred in clinical trials and changed our
	recognition of the remaining unrecognized upfront payments accordingly. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, we changed the estimate of our period of involvement from 34 months to 39 months and 40 months, respectively, due to
	additional delays and changed our recognition of the remaining unrecognized upfront payments accordingly.

	Under the AbbVie CF
	collaboration program, we received a one-time non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment of $45.0 million (&#128;34.0 million) in October 2013. Upfront revenue was recognized over the period of our involvement, which was estimated to last until
	the end of 2015.

	Milestone revenues decreased by &#128;0.7&nbsp;million, or 4%, to
	&#128;19.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 compared to &#128;20.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. This decrease was primarily related to fewer milestones achieved in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of
	the maturing pipeline of our projects under alliance. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, $10 million of milestones (&#128;8.3 million) were recognized in relation with our CF collaboration agreement with AbbVie. Under the CF arrangement with
	AbbVie, we may be eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $340 million depending on future progress of the collaboration. Further milestone payments of &#128;11.5&nbsp;million in 2014 primarily related to partnered programs with
	Janssen Pharmaceutica; Les Laboratoires Servier, or Servier; and GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, &#128;20.5&nbsp;million of milestones primarily related to partnered programs with Janssen Pharmaceutica, Servier

	R&amp;D expenditure under alliance increased by &#128;3.5&nbsp;million, or 5%, from &#128;72.8&nbsp;million
	for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 to &#128;76.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, primarily due to increased spending on the new CF program with AbbVie, which represented &#128;14.9&nbsp;million for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 compared to &#128;2.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. To a lesser extent, R&amp;D expenditure increased with regard to the RA and CD collaboration with AbbVie for filgotinib by &#128;5.3&nbsp;million,
	from &#128;28.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 to &#128;33.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The movements above were partially offset by a decrease in other alliance costs, which explains the increase
	of the R&amp;D costs under alliance by only 5%, or &#128;3.5 million. We also increased our investments in our own funded portfolio by &#128;8.2&nbsp;million, or 31%, from &#128;26.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 to
	&#128;34.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	&#128;7.9&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. This decrease is related to (i)&nbsp;the release of the &#128;3&nbsp;million bank guarantee issued in 2013 for the rental of the new premises in France which expired on June&nbsp;30,
	2015 following the move to the new offices, (ii)&nbsp;the payment of a claim to Charles River by decrease of the escrow account, and (iii)&nbsp;a &#128;0.7&nbsp;million bank guarantee issued in September 2015 for the rental of new premises in The

	We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would
	cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest to occur of (1)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue; (2)&nbsp;the date we qualify as a &#147;large accelerated filer,&#148; with at

	period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Given that we currently report and expect to continue to report under IFRS as issued by the IASB, we have irrevocably elected
	not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required by the IASB. We have taken advantage of reduced

	On March&nbsp;13, 2014, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the service division operations to Charles River
	Laboratories International, Inc., or Charles River, for a total consideration of up to &#128;134 million. Charles River agreed to pay us an immediate cash consideration of &#128;129 million. The potential earn-out of &#128;5&nbsp;million due upon
	achievement of a revenue target 12 months after transaction closing has not been obtained. Approximately 5% of the total consideration, including price adjustments, is being held on an escrow account. To date, four claims have been introduced by
	Charles River, of which three claims have been settled for a total amount of &#128;1.0 million. One claim is still being investigated. An amount of &#128;0.3&nbsp;million has been accrued in March 2015 based on a preliminary estimate of the
	exposure. The release of the escrow account will be possible after final agreement between the parties on the amounts at stake. Following the divestment, we remain guarantor for a limited transitional period in respect of the lease obligations for
	certain U.K. premises amounting to &pound;4&nbsp;million future rent payments. Charles River will fully indemnify us against all liabilities arising in connection with the lease obligation. We evaluated the risk to be remote. Finally, following
	common practice, we have given customary representations and warranties which are capped and limited in time.

	In the course of 2008, a

	exact amount of damages. Considering the defense elements provided and the recent judgment in the court in our favor, our board and management evaluated the risk to be remote to possible, but not likely. Accordingly, it was decided not to record any
	provision in 2015 as the exposure was considered to be limited.

	We have established a number of warrant plans, under which we have granted warrants free of charge to the recipients, i.e., employees,
	directors and independent consultants of our company. For warrant plans issued prior to 2011, the warrants offered to the employees and independent consultants vest according to the following schedule: 10% of the warrants vest on the date of the
	grant; an additional 10% vest at the first anniversary of the grant; an additional 20% vest at the second anniversary of the grant; an additional 20% vest at the third anniversary of the grant; and an additional 40% vest at the end of the third
	calendar year following the grant. The warrants granted under warrant plans created from 2011 up to (and including) Warrant Plan 2015 vest at the end of the third calendar year following the year of the grant, with no intermediate vesting. The
	warrants granted under Warrant Plan 2015 (B)&nbsp;and Warrant Plan 2015 RMV vest on the third anniversary of the notary deed enacting the acceptance of the warrants. The warrants offered to directors vest over a period of 36 months at a rate of 1/36

	&nbsp;per month. Warrants cannot be exercised before the end of the third calendar year following the year of the grant, except for warrants granted under Warrant Plan 2015 (B)&nbsp;and Warrant Plan
	2015 RMV, which become exercisable on the third anniversary of the notary deed enacting the acceptance of the warrants. Pursuant to a resolution adopted at the extraordinary general shareholders&#146; meeting held on May&nbsp;23, 2011, a provision
	has been incorporated in the warrant plans, which provides that in the event of a change of control of our company, all outstanding warrants vest immediately and will be immediately exercisable.

	After the reverse 4:1 share split approved by the shareholders&#146; meeting held on March&nbsp;29, 2005, four warrants under Warrant Plan
	2002 Belgium entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one ordinary share. For the warrant plans created from 2005 onwards, one warrant entitles the warrant holder to subscribe for one ordinary share. In the summaries and tables below, the numbers
	of warrants issued under Warrant Plan 2002 Belgium are divided by four to avoid a mixture of rights.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On December&nbsp;16, 2015, we signed an exclusive license and collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize filgotinib in multiple
	indications with Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Unlimited Company. Under the terms of the collaboration, Gilead is primarily responsible for development and for seeking regulatory approval of the licensed product. We are required to use
	commercially reasonable efforts as requested by Gilead to assist Gilead with certain development activities. In the framework of the closing of the transaction on January&nbsp;19, 2016, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Unlimited Company made a $425

	amount of our net assets on the date of the closing of the last financial year according to our statutory annual accounts (i.e., the amount of the assets as shown in the balance sheet, decreased with provisions and liabilities, all as prepared in
	accordance with Belgian accounting rules), decreased with the non-amortized costs of incorporation and expansion and the non-amortized costs for research and development, does not fall below the amount of the paid-up capital (or, if higher, the
	called capital), increased with the amount of non-distributable reserves. Finally, prior to distributing dividends, we must allocate at least 5% of our annual net profits (under our non-consolidated statutory accounts prepared in accordance with

	calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, it is expected that any distribution will be reported as a dividend, even if that distribution would otherwise be treated as a non-taxable return of capital or as capital
	gain under the rules described above. Non-corporate U.S. holders may qualify for the preferential rates of taxation with respect to dividends on ADSs applicable to long-term capital gains (i.e., gains from the sale of capital assets held for more
	than one year) applicable to qualified dividend income (as discussed below) if we are a &#147;qualified foreign corporation&#148; and certain other requirements (discussed below) are met. A non-U.S. corporation (other than a corporation that is
	classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year) generally will be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (a)&nbsp;if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with
	the United States which the Secretary of Treasury of the United States determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and which includes an exchange of information provision, or (b)&nbsp;with respect to any dividend it pays on ADSs which
	are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. The ADSs are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, which is an established securities market in the United States, and we expect the ADSs to be readily
	tradable on NASDAQ. However, there can be no assurance that the ADSs will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States in later years. The company, which is incorporated under the laws of Belgium, believes
	that it qualifies as a resident of Belgium for purposes of, and is eligible for the benefits of, The Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium for the Avoidance of Double Taxation
	and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed on November&nbsp;27, 2006, or the U.S.-Belgium Tax Treaty, although there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, the IRS has determined that the U.S.-Belgium Tax
	Treaty is satisfactory for purposes of the qualified dividend rules and that it includes an exchange-of-information program. Therefore, subject to the discussion under &#147;&#151;Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations&#148; below, such
	dividends will generally be &#147;qualified dividend income&#148; in the hands of individual U.S. holders, provided that a holding period requirement (more than 60 days of ownership, without protection from the risk of loss, during the 121-day
	period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date) and certain other requirements are met. The dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate U.S. holders.

	A U.S. holder generally may claim the amount of any Belgian withholding tax as either a deduction from gross income or a credit against U.S.
	federal income tax liability. However, the foreign tax credit is subject to numerous complex limitations that must be determined and applied on an individual basis. Generally, the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of a U.S. holder&#146;s
	U.S. federal income tax liability that such U.S. holder&#146;s taxable income bears to such U.S. holder&#146;s worldwide taxable income. In applying this limitation, a U.S. holder&#146;s various items of income and deduction must be classified,
	under complex rules, as either &#147;foreign source&#148; or &#147;U.S. source.&#148; In addition, this limitation is calculated separately with respect to specific categories of income. The amount of a distribution with respect to the ADSs that is
	treated as a &#147;dividend&#148; may be lower for U.S.

	Certain elections exist that may alleviate some of the adverse consequences of PFIC status and would result in an alternative treatment (such

	adjusted tax basis, and will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of any excess of the adjusted tax basis of the ADSs over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously
	included as a result of the mark-to-market election). If a U.S. holder makes the election, the U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in the ADSs will be adjusted to reflect these income or loss amounts. Any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of
	ADSs in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as an ordinary loss (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election). The mark-to-

	However, as of January&nbsp;1, 2016, a new tax on capital gains entered into effect, referred to as the Speculation Tax. The Speculation Tax

	after the date of acquisition, outside the exercise of a professional activity. The Speculation Tax also applies on short sales as defined under article 2, 1st ind., b of EU Regulation n&deg; 236/2012 dated March&nbsp;14, 2012. The Speculation Tax
	also applies on the capital gains on shares acquired by way of (direct or indirect) gift and disposed of for consideration within 6 months after the date of the acquisition/gift of the shares.

	Certain capital gains are however excluded from the Speculation Tax such as the capital gains realized on shares where the acquisition has

	place solely on the issuer&#146;s initiative and where no choice was presented to the taxpayer (mandatory corporate actions such as mergers, demergers and squeeze outs) are also excluded from the Speculation Tax.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The taxable base of the Speculation Tax is equal to the difference between (i)&nbsp;the price received when disposing of the shares (in
	whatever form), reduced with the levied Belgian tax on stock exchange transactions (see &#147;&#151;Belgian Tax on Stock Exchange Transactions&#148; below) borne by the taxpayer on the transfer, and (ii)&nbsp;the acquisition price paid by the
	taxpayer (or the donor in case of a gift) increased with the Belgian tax on stock exchange transactions borne by the taxpayer (or donor) upon the acquisition of the shares. If the acquisition price is unknown, the withholding tax is applied on the

	For the calculation of the six month period the &#147;Last In, First Out&#148; method is used. This method implies that the last share that
	was acquired by the shareholder is also deemed to be the first share that is sold. The six-month period is calculated per share with an identical ISIN-code. In case of short-selling the six month period is calculated by looking at the time elapsed

	Under a strict reading of Article 228, &#167;3 ITC, capital gains realized on ADSs by non-residents could be subject to Belgian
	taxation, levied in the form of a professional withholding tax, if the following three conditions are cumulatively met: (i)&nbsp;the capital gain would have been taxable if the non- resident were a Belgian tax resident, (ii)&nbsp;the income is
	&#147;borne by&#148; a Belgian resident or by a Belgian establishment of a foreign entity (which would, in such a context, mean that the capital gain is realized upon a transfer of ADSs to a Belgian resident or to a Belgian establishment of a
	foreign entity, together a Belgian Purchaser), and (iii)&nbsp;Belgium has the right to tax such capital gain pursuant to the applicable double tax treaty, or, if no such tax treaty applies, the non-resident does not demonstrate that the capital gain
	is effectively taxed in its state of residence.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However, it is unclear whether a capital gain included in the purchase price of an asset
	can be considered to be &#147;borne by&#148; the purchaser of the asset within the meaning of the second condition mentioned above.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, applying this withholding tax would require that the Belgian Purchaser is aware of (i)&nbsp;the identity of the non-resident (to
	assess the third condition mentioned above), and (ii)&nbsp;the amount of the capital gain realized by the non-resident (since such amount determines the amount of professional withholding tax to be levied by the Belgian Purchaser). Consequently, the
	application of this professional withholding tax on transactions with respect to the ADSs occurring on the stock exchange would give rise to practical difficulties as the seller and purchaser typically do not know each other.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to these uncertainties, the parliamentary documents of the law that introduced Article 228, &#167;3 ITC support the view that the
	legislator did not intend for Article 228, &#167;3 ITC to apply to a capital gain included in the purchase price of an asset, but only to payments for services.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On July&nbsp;23, 2014, formal guidance on the interpretation of Article 228, &#167;3 ITC has been issued by the Belgian tax authorities
	(published in the Belgian Official Gazette of July&nbsp;23, 2014). The Belgian tax authorities state therein that Article 228, &#167;3 ITC only covers payments for services, as a result of which no professional withholding tax should apply to
	capital gains realized by non-residents in the situations described above. It should, however, be noted that a formal guidance issued by the tax authorities does not supersede and cannot amend the law if the latter is found to be sufficiently clear
	in itself. Accordingly, in case of dispute, it cannot be ruled out that the interpretation of Article 228, &#167;3 ITC made by the tax authorities in their formal guidance is not upheld by the competent courts.

	Proposed Financial Transactions Tax
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On February&nbsp;14, 2013, the EU Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Directive, or the Draft Directive, on a common financial
	transaction tax, or FTT. The intention is for the FTT to be implemented through an enhanced cooperation procedure in 11 member states (Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia and Slovenia, together the
	Participating Member States).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to the Draft Directive, the FTT will be payable on financial transactions, provided (a)&nbsp;at
	least one party to the financial transaction is established or deemed established in a Participating Member State, and (b)&nbsp;there is a financial institution established or deemed established in a Participating Member State which is a party to
	the financial transactions, or is acting in the name of a party to the transaction. The FTT will however not apply to (inter alia) primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006, including the activity of
	underwriting and subsequent allocation of financial instruments in the framework of their issue.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The proposed FTT has a very broad scope
	and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in ADSs in certain circumstances. Under current proposals, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States.
	Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in ADSs where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, &#147;established&#148; in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances,
	including by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The rates of the FTT will be fixed by each
	Participating Member State, but will amount to at least 0.1% of the taxable amount for transactions involving financial instruments other than derivatives. The taxable amount for such transactions will in general be determined by reference to the
	consideration paid or owed in return for the transfer. The FTT will be payable by each financial institution established or deemed established in a Participating Member State which is either a party to the financial transaction, or acting in the
	name of a party to the transaction or where the transaction has been carried out on its account. When the FTT due was not paid within the applicable time limits, each party to a financial transaction, including persons other than financial
	institutions, will become jointly and severally liable for the payment of the FTT due.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A statement made by the Participating Member
	States (other than Slovenia) indicated that a progressive implementation of the FTT is being considered and that the FTT may initially only apply to transactions involving shares and certain derivatives, with implementation occurring by
	January&nbsp;1, 2016. Full details are however not available.

	Depositary fees payable upon the issuance and cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the
	depositary by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) receiving the newly issued ADSs from the depositary and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the depositary for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these fees
	to their clients. Depositary fees payable in connection with distributions of cash or securities to ADS holders and the depositary services fee are charged by the depositary to the holders of record of ADSs as of the applicable ADS record date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally deducted from the cash being distributed. In the case of distributions other
	than cash (i.e., stock dividend, rights), the depositary charges the applicable fee to the ADS record date holders concurrent with the distribution. In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated or uncertificated
	in direct registration), the depositary sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders. In the case of ADSs held in brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary generally collects its fees through the systems provided by DTC
	(whose nominee is the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians holding ADSs in their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who hold their clients&#146; ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients&#146;
	accounts the amount of the fees paid to the depositary.

	In the event of refusal to pay the depositary fees, the depositary may, under the
	terms of the deposit agreement, refuse the requested service until payment is received or may set off the amount of the depositary fees from any distribution to be made to the ADS holder.

	In May 2015, we sold 4,996,522 ADSs, each representing one ordinary share, no nominal value, and 1,553,478 ordinary shares, in our
	global offering at a price of $42.05 per ADS and &#128;37.00&nbsp;per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately &#128;278.7 million. The net offering proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
	offering expenses, were approximately &#128;259.3&nbsp;million. The offering commenced on May&nbsp;6, 2015 and did not terminate before all of the securities registered in the registration statement were sold. The effective date of the registration
	statement, File No.&nbsp;333-203435, for our global offering was May&nbsp;13, 2015. Morgan Stanley&nbsp;&amp; Co. LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Cowen and Company, LLC acted as joint book-running managers, and Nomura Securities
	International, Inc. and Bryan, Garnier&nbsp;&amp; Co. acted as co-managers, of the global offering.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A portion of the net proceeds from
	our global offering was used to advance our CF program and our other discovery and development programs, as well as for general corporate and working capital purposes. The balance is held in cash and cash equivalents and is intended to be used to
	advance the discovery and development of our programs, mainly our CF and IPF programs, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. We currently expect that our cash needs for developing our filgotinib program with Gilead will be entirely
	financed by the equity investment and upfront payment which were received in January 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying consolidated
	statements of financial position of Galapagos NV and subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of 31&nbsp;December 2015, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for the periods ended
	31&nbsp;December 2015, 2014 and 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
	the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Galapagos NV and subsidiaries as of
	31&nbsp;December 2015, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the periods ended 31&nbsp;December 2015, 2014 and 2013, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (&#147;IFRS&#148;) as issued by
	the International Accounting Standards Board.

	In 2014, following the sale of the service division on April&nbsp;1, 2014, the continuing operations related primarily to R&amp;D

	In 2015, the IFRS 8 threshold of 10% of the combined revenues,
	external and inter-segment, of all segments was met by the external and internal revenues reported by our Fee-for-service business located in Croatia. Consequently, there are two reportable segments in 2015, R&amp;D and Fee-for-service business.

	Milestone revenues and costs reimbursements decreased by &#128;12.1&nbsp;million, or 61%, to &#128;7.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 compared to &#128;19.8&nbsp;million for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014. This decrease was primarily related to fewer milestones achieved in 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the increasing proprietary nature of the pipeline programs. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015
	&#128;2.2&nbsp;million and &#128;1.2&nbsp;million of costs were reimbursed in relation with respectively the CF and Filgotinib Collaboration Agreement with AbbVie, and &#128;3.8&nbsp;million of milestones related to partnered programs with Servier

	On December&nbsp;16, 2015, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV entered into a global collaboration for the development
	and commercialization of filgotinib, in the framework of which Gilead committed to an upfront payment of $725 million consisting of a license fee of $300 million and a $425 million equity investment in Galapagos NV by subscribing to new shares at a
	price of &#128;58&nbsp;per share, including issuance premium. This agreement was effectively completed and entered into force January&nbsp;19, 2016 and full payment was received.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the agreement, we recognized a deferred income and an offsetting short-term financial asset (derivative) of
	&#128;39&nbsp;million upon signing of the share subscription agreement with Gilead as required under IAS 39. This financial asset initially reflects the share premium that Gilead committed to pay above the closing stock price of Galapagos on the day
	of entering into the subscription agreement. Under IAS 39 the fair value of the financial asset is re-measured at year-end and again upon entering into force of the subscription agreement on January&nbsp;19, 2016, when the financial asset expired.
	Variations in fair value of the financial asset are recorded in the income statement.

	The decrease in the fair value of the financial asset resulting from the increase in the
	Galapagos share price between signing of the subscription agreement and December&nbsp;31, 2015 resulted in a negative, non-cash fair value charge of &#128;30.6&nbsp;million in the financial results. The subsequent increase in the fair value of the
	financial asset resulting from the decrease in the Galapagos share price between January&nbsp;1, 2016 and January&nbsp;19, 2016 will result in a positive non-cash gain of &#128;57.5&nbsp;million in the financial result of the first quarter of 2016.

	The tax liabilities amounting to &#128;2.6&nbsp;million on December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 are primarily related to the
	recognition of tax liabilities for one of the subsidiaries operating on a cost plus basis for &#128;2.1&nbsp;million as a consequence of a tax audit. In addition, taxes on gain on the sale of the service division in 2014 are included in the tax
	liabilities for &#128;0.4 million. The income tax expense in connection with the sale of the service division was only &#128;0.4&nbsp;million, since the gain is considered as a capital gain under Belgian tax law, which is subject to a tax rate of
	less than 1%.

	Total R&amp;D incentives receivables increased by &#128;1.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 compared to
	December&nbsp;31, 2013. This increase is explained by a new R&amp;D incentives reported in 2014 for &#128;11.9&nbsp;million (&#128;7.6 million related to French R&amp;D incentives and &#128;4.3&nbsp;million related to Belgian R&amp;D incentives)
	less the payment received related to French R&amp;D incentives amounting to &#128;8.6 million. The remaining variance of &#128;1.9&nbsp;million was explained by the phasing out of the consolidation scope of the service division which contributed to
	the total current R&amp;D receivables at the end of 2013.

	Restricted cash amounted to &#128;10.7&nbsp;million on December&nbsp;31, 2014, and decreased to &#128;7.9&nbsp;million on
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. This decrease is related to (a)&nbsp;the release of the &#128;3&nbsp;million bank guarantee issued in 2013 for the rental of the new premises in France which expired on June&nbsp;30, 2015 following the move to the new
	offices, (b)&nbsp;the payment of a claim to Charles River by decrease of the escrow account, and (c)&nbsp;a &#128;0.7&nbsp;million bank guarantee issued in September 2015 for the rental of new premises in The Netherlands (to replace the current
	premises) which will expire on October&nbsp;1, 2025. Restricted cash on December&nbsp;31, 2015 is related to &#128;0.3&nbsp;million and &#128;0.7&nbsp;million bank guarantees on real estate lease obligations in Belgium and in The Netherlands
	respectively, and to &#128;6.9&nbsp;million escrow account containing part of the proceeds from the sale of the service division in 2014 for which the release will be possible after final agreement between the parties on the exposure regarding one
	outstanding claim. An amount of &#128;0.3&nbsp;million has been accrued in 2015 based on a preliminary estimate of the exposure.

	We have a history of losses. Excluding the impact of possible upfront or milestone payments to be received from
	collaborations, we forecast to continue incurring taxable losses in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in clinical and pre-clinical development programs and discovery platforms. Consequently, no deferred tax asset has been set up as at
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, except for two subsidiaries operating on a cost plus basis for which a deferred tax asset was set up (of &#128;1.7&nbsp;million as explained above).

	On March&nbsp;13, 2014, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the service division operations to Charles River Laboratories International,
	Inc. (the &#147;Buyer&#148;) for a total consideration of up to &#128;134 million. Charles River agreed to pay us an immediate cash consideration of &#128;129 million. The potential earn-out of &#128;5&nbsp;million due upon achievement of a revenue
	target 12 months after transaction closing has not been obtained. Approximately 5% of the total consideration, including price adjustments, is being held on an escrow account. To date, four claims have been introduced by the Buyer, of which three
	claims have been settled for a total amount of &#128;1.0 million. One claim is still being investigated. An amount of &#128;0.3&nbsp;million has been accrued in March 2015 based on a preliminary estimate of the exposure. The release of the escrow
	account will be possible after final agreement between the parties on the amounts at stake.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Following the divestment, we remain guarantor for a limited
	transitional period in respect of the lease obligations for certain U.K. premises amounting to &pound;4&nbsp;million future rent payments. The Buyer will fully indemnify us against all liabilities arising in connection with the lease obligation. We
	evaluated the risk to be remote. Finally, following common practice, we have given customary representations and warranties which are capped and limited in time.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the course of 2008, a former director of one of the subsidiaries sued for wrongful termination and seeks damages of &#128;1.1 million. We believe that the
	amount of damages claimed is unrealistically high. In 2014, the court requested an external advisor to evaluate the exact amount of damages. Considering the defense elements provided and the recent judgment in the court in our favor, our Board and
	management evaluated the risk to be remote to possible, but not likely. Accordingly, it was decided not to record any provision in 2015 as the exposure is considered to be limited.

	to minimum guaranteed rates of return, 3.25% on employer contributions and 3.75% on employee contributions up to December&nbsp;31, 2015. These rates, which apply as an average over the entire career, could be modified by Royal Decree. Therefore,

	Presented below is a summary of warrant plans activities for the reported periods. Various warrant plans were approved for the benefit of our employees, and
	for Directors and independent consultants of Galapagos NV. For warrant plans issued prior to 2011, the warrants offered to the employees and independent consultants vest according to the following schedule: 10% of the warrants vest on the date of
	the grant; an additional 10% vest at the first anniversary of the grant; an additional 20% vest at the second anniversary of the grant; an additional 20% vest at the third anniversary of the grant; and an additional 40% vest at the end of the third
	calendar year following the grant. The warrants granted under warrant plans created from 2011 up to (and including) Warrant Plan 2015 vest at the end of the third calendar year following the year of the grant, with no intermediate vesting. The
	warrants granted under Warrant Plan 2015 (B)&nbsp;and Warrant Plan 2015 RMV vest on the third anniversary of the notary deed enacting the acceptance of the warrants. The warrants offered to Directors vest over a period of 36 months at a rate of
	1/36th&nbsp;per month. Warrants cannot be exercised before the end of the third calendar year following the year of the grant, except for warrants granted under Warrant Plan 2015 (B)&nbsp;and Warrant Plan 2015 RMV, which become exercisable on the
	third anniversary of the notary deed enacting the acceptance of the warrants. Pursuant to a resolution adopted at the Extraordinary Shareholders&#146; Meeting held on May&nbsp;23, 2011, a provision has been incorporated in the warrant plans, which
	provides that in the event of a change of control over Galapagos NV, all outstanding warrants vest immediately and will be immediately exercisable.

	Directors together (other than Dr.&nbsp;Parekh and the CEO) for the exercise of their mandate as a Director of Galapagos NV is fixed, on an aggregate basis, at &#128;200,000 (plus expenses). The same Annual Shareholders&#146; Meeting granted a power
	of attorney to the Board to determine the remuneration of the individual Board members within the limits of said aggregate amount. Pursuant to this power of attorney, the Board determined, after discussion within the Nomination and Remuneration
	Committee, the allocation of the aggregate annual remuneration for Directors as follows: (a)&nbsp;annual remuneration for each non-executive Director (Dr. Cautreels, Dr.&nbsp;Van Barlingen, Mr.&nbsp;Rowe and Ms.&nbsp;Bosley): &#128;40,000; and
	(b)&nbsp;additional remuneration for the chairman of the Audit Committee (Dr. Cautreels): &#128;5,000. Dr.&nbsp;Mummery, being appointed as non-executive Director as from September&nbsp;30, 2015, received &#128;10,000 as remuneration for the
	performance of her mandate during the last quarter of 2015.

	independent Director as reimbursement of expenses disbursed during the previous financial year (no such payment was made in 2014 nor 2013).

	On January&nbsp;4, 2013 we acquired Cangenix Ltd. which is located in Canterbury, UK. Cangenix is a structure-based drug
	discovery company and has been added to the Argenta service offering. It was formed in 2011 by scientists from the Structural Biology and Biophysics group at Pfizer Sandwich, UK. Recognized as experts in the field, the Cangenix team brings over 70
	years of combined experience in the application of protein crystallography and biophysical techniques to drug discovery. Cangenix contributed &#128;1.3&nbsp;million of revenues for the period between the date of acquisition and December&nbsp;31,
	2013. In the 9 months reference period prior to the date of acquisition, Cangenix reported &#128;0.7&nbsp;million of revenues. The consideration paid for Cangenix in the course of 2013 amounted to &#128;1.2&nbsp;million, including
	&#128;0.1&nbsp;million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. A deferred consideration of &#128;0.5&nbsp;million has been recognized on the balance sheet and is payable after two years upon achievement of certain conditions. The goodwill arising on
	the acquisition of Cangenix Ltd. amounts to &#128;1.6 million.

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the application of the accounting policies, we are required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
	liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is
	revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revisions and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Drafting financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments and estimates and to use assumptions that influence the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities, the notes on contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The following are the critical judgments and estimates that we have made in the process of applying the accounting policies and that have the most

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As described in note 7, Gilead Sciences, Inc (&#147;Gilead&#148;) committed itself on December&nbsp;16, 2015 to make a $425 million equity investment
	in Galapagos by subscribing to new shares at a fixed price of &#128;58&nbsp;per share, including issuance premium upon completion of the license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos that took place on January&nbsp;19, 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Significant judgment had to be applied in assessing whether this forward subscription commitment of Gilead over the own shares of Galapagos shall be
	classified as an own equity instrument of Galapagos or as a derivative financial asset. IAS 32 requires that for a derivative to meet the definition of equity it must be settled only by the issuer (Galapagos) exchanging a &#147;fixed amount of cash
	or another financial asset for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.&#148; Because the above mentioned commitment of Gilead was made in $, the actual number of shares finally issued by Galapagos varied with the fluctuation in the $/&#128;
	exchange rate until the settlement date on January&nbsp;19, 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Despite the fact that this foreign exchange exposure is limited, management judged that
	this variability prevents the instrument from being classified as equity under IAS 32 and is therefore treated as a derivative at fair value through profit and loss.

	Evaluating the criteria for revenue
	recognition with respect to our research and development and collaboration agreements requires management&#146;s judgment to ensure that all criteria have been fulfilled prior to recognizing any amount of revenue. In particular, such judgments are
	made with respect to determination of the nature of transactions, whether simultaneous transactions shall be considered as one or more revenue-generating transactions, allocation of the contractual price (upfront and milestone payments in connection
	with a collaboration agreement) to several elements included in an agreement, and the determination of whether the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer. Collaboration agreements are reviewed carefully to understand the
	nature of risks and rewards of the arrangement. All of our revenue-generating transactions have been subject to such evaluation by management.

	We recognize expenses incurred in carrying out clinical trials during the course of each clinical trial in line with the state of completion of each trial.
	This involves the calculation of clinical trial accruals at each period end to account for incurred expenses. This requires estimation of the expected full cost to complete the trial as well as the current stage of trial completion.

	Clinical trials usually take place over extended time periods and typically involve a set-up phase, a recruitment phase and a completion phase which ends upon
	the receipt of a final report containing full statistical analysis of trial results. Accruals are prepared separately for each clinical trial in progress and take into consideration the stage of completion of each trial including the number of
	patients that have entered the trial and whether the final report has been received. In all cases, the full cost of each trial is expensed by the time the final report is received. There have not been any material adjustments to estimates based on
	the actual costs incurred for each period presented.

	We determine the costs of the share-based payments plans (warrant plans) on the basis of the fair value of the equity instrument at grant date. Determining the

	the estimated expected life of the warrant and the volatility. The judgments made and the model used are further specified in

	The cost of a defined pension arrangement is determined based on actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation assumes the estimation of
	discount rates, estimated returns on assets, future salary increases, mortality figures and future pension increases. Because of the long-term nature of these pension plans, the valuation of these is subject to important uncertainties.

	Significant judgment is required in determining the use of tax loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or tax credits are only
	recognized to the extent that there are sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilized.
	Management&#146;s judgment is that such convincing evidence is currently not sufficiently available except for two subsidiaries operating intercompany on a cost plus basis and as such a deferred tax asset is therefore recognized. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had a total of approximately &#128;265&nbsp;million of statutory tax losses carried forward which can be compensated with future taxable statutory profits for an indefinite period except for an amount of
	&#128;17&nbsp;million in Switzerland, Croatia, the United States and The Netherlands with expiry date between 2018 and 2030. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the available tax losses carried forward in Belgium amounted to &#128;184 million.

	We have been temporarily exposed to financial market and currency risk though our share subscription agreement with Gilead.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On December&nbsp;16, 2015, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Galapagos NV entered into a global collaboration for the development and commercialization of filgotinib,
	in the framework of which Gilead committed to an upfront payment of $725 million consisting of a license fee of $300 million and a $425 million equity investment in Galapagos NV by subscribing to new shares at a price of &#128;58&nbsp;per share,
	including issuance premium. This agreement was effectively completed and entered into force January&nbsp;19, 2016 and full payment was received.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	connection with the agreement, we recognized a deferred income and an offsetting short-term financial asset (derivative) of &#128;39&nbsp;million upon signing of the share subscription agreement with Gilead as required under IAS 39. This financial
	asset initially reflects the share premium that Gilead committed to pay above the closing stock price of Galapagos on the day of entering into the subscription agreement. This amount also represents a deferred income that will be recognized in
	revenues at the same rhythm than the $300 million upfront payment for the license.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The fair value of this derivative financial asset was initially

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under IAS 39 the fair value of the derivative financial asset is re-measured at year end and again upon execution of the subscription agreement on
	January&nbsp;19, 2016, when the financial asset expired. Variations in fair value of the financial asset are recorded in the income statement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	decrease in the fair value of the financial asset resulting from the increase in the Galapagos share price between signing of the subscription agreement and December&nbsp;31, 2015 resulted in a non-cash, fair value re-measurement of
	&#128;30.6&nbsp;million in the financial results. On December&nbsp;31, 2015, the fair value of the financial asset was re-measured based on the implied value of the Galapagos share at the end of January 2016, the implied volatility of the EUR/USD

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On January&nbsp;19, 2016, we completed the closing of the global collaboration agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. in the framework of which Gilead made a
	$425 million (or &#128;392 million) equity investment in Galapagos NV by subscribing to new shares at a price of &#128;58&nbsp;per share, including issuance premium. This resulted in Gilead owning 6,760,701 ordinary shares of Galapagos NV,
	representing 14.75% of the then-outstanding share capital of Galapagos. We also received a license fee of $300 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive development and regulatory milestone-based payments of up to $755&nbsp;million and
	sales-based milestone payments of up to $600&nbsp;million, with tiered royalties starting at 20% and a profit split in co-promotion territories.

	On December&nbsp;21, 2015, the Board of Directors conditionally issued up to 700,000 warrants (subject to acceptance by the beneficiaries) within the

	Directors and to the members of the Executive Committee under Warrant Plan 2015 (B)&nbsp;was approved by the Special Shareholders&#146; Meeting of December&nbsp;22, 2015. The warrants to be issued under Warrant Plan 2015 (B)&nbsp;and Warrant Plan
	2015 RMV have a term of eight years and an exercise price of &#128;49.00. The acceptance of, in aggregate, 496,500 warrants under these two warrant plans was enacted on March 2, 2016.
