	is an initial public offering of our securities. Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and one-third of one warrant. Each whole
	warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus, and only whole
	warrants are exercisable. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30&nbsp;days after the completion of our initial business combination or 12&nbsp;months from the closing of this
	offering, and will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation, as described in this prospectus. No fractional warrants will be
	issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. We have also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 5,625,000 units to cover over-allotments,
	if any.

	We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a
	per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account described below as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business
	combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to fund our working capital requirements or pay our franchise and income taxes, divided
	by the number of then outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock that were sold as part of the units in this offering, which we refer to collectively as our public shares throughout this
	prospectus, subject to the limitations described herein. If we are unable to complete our business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of this offering, we will redeem 100% of the
	public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not
	previously released to us to fund our working capital requirements or pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then
	outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein.

	Our
	sponsor, Gores Sponsor II&nbsp;LLC (which we refer to as our sponsor throughout this prospectus), has committed to purchase an aggregate of 6,333,334 warrants (or 7,083,334 warrants if the
	over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $1.50 per whole warrant (approximately $9,500,000 in the aggregate, or $10,625,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a
	private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. We refer to these warrants as the private placement warrants throughout this prospectus. Each whole private
	placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one whole share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock at $11.50 per share.

	Our
	sponsor purchased 10,781,250 shares of our Class&nbsp;F common stock (up to 1,406,250 shares of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters' over-allotment
	option is exercised). We refer to these shares of Class&nbsp;F common stock as the founder shares throughout this prospectus. The shares of Class&nbsp;F common stock will automatically convert
	into shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock at the time of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein. In
	the case that additional shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing
	of the business combination, the ratio at which shares of Class&nbsp;F common stock shall convert into shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the
	outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;F common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock
	issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class&nbsp;F common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock
	outstanding upon completion of this offering plus all shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination (excluding
	any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination). Holders of the Class&nbsp;F common stock and holders of the Class&nbsp;A common stock
	will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, except as required by law.

	Currently, there is no public market for our units, Class&nbsp;A common stock or warrants. We have applied to list our units on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ, under the symbol "GSHTU" on or
	promptly after the date of this prospectus. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on NASDAQ. The Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants comprising the units will begin
	separate trading on the 52nd&nbsp;day following the date of this prospectus unless Deutsche Bank Securities&nbsp;Inc. informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our
	filing a Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, containing an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds of this offering
	and issuing a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, we expect that the Class&nbsp;A common stock and
	warrants will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols "GSHT" and "GSHTW," respectively.

	100 businesses including a current portfolio of more than 20 active companies worldwide. Under Mr.&nbsp;Gores' leadership, The Gores Group has effected a number of successful corporate
	carve-out acquisitions over the last two decades. The Gores Group acquired VeriFone from Hewlett-Packard Company at a time when the business was generating significant revenues, but was cash flow
	negative. The Gores Group implemented dramatic changes to the business, and the business was sold and subsequently went public with an operating partner from The Gores Group serving as its chief
	executive officer. During that same timeframe, The Gores Group acquired The Learning Company from Mattel Corporation and transformed that business which, similarly, was generating significant
	revenues, but was
	suffering from severely negative cash flow. Since then, with Mr.&nbsp;Gores leading the firm, The Gores Group has created significant value in numerous transactions, including the acquisitions of
	Global Tel*Link from Schlumberger&nbsp;Ltd., Stock Building Supply from Wolseley&nbsp;plc, Therakos from Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, the electronics power systems business from TE
	Connectivity&nbsp;Ltd., Siemens Enterprise Communications from Siemens AG and Sagem Communications from the Safran Group, among others. Mr.&nbsp;Gores began his career as a self-made entrepreneur
	and operating executive. In 1978, he self-funded and founded Executive Business Systems (EBS), a developer and distributor of vertical business software systems. Within seven years, EBS had become a
	leading value-added reseller in Michigan and employed over 200 people. In 1986, CONTEL purchased EBS, and Mr.&nbsp;Gores subsequently began acquiring and operating non-core businesses from major
	corporations and building value in those entities, a decision that ultimately led to the founding of what has evolved into The Gores Group today. Under his leadership, The Gores Group has continued to
	acquire businesses in need of operational and financial resources, while creating value and working with management teams to establish an entrepreneurial environment as a foundation for sustainable
	growth. As of March&nbsp;31, 2016, The Gores Group had approximately $2.5&nbsp;billion in assets under management.

	2015, Mr.&nbsp;Gores and Mr.&nbsp;Stone founded Gores Holdings,&nbsp;Inc. ("Gores I"), a blank check company formed for substantially similar purposes as our company.
	Mr.&nbsp;Stone served as Chief Executive Officer and Mr.&nbsp;McBride served as Chief Financial Officer. Gores I completed its initial public offering in August 2015, in which it sold 37,500,000
	units, each consisting of one share of Gores I common stock and one warrant to purchase one-half of one share of Gores I common stock, for an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating aggregate
	proceeds of $375,000,000. Gores I completed its business combination with Hostess Brands,&nbsp;Inc. ("Hostess") in November 2016, in which it contributed approximately $725&nbsp;million to Hostess
	(consisting of $375&nbsp;million in proceeds from the initial public offering and a simultaneous private placement, plus approximately $350&nbsp;million in proceeds from an additional private
	placement completed at the time of the initial business combination). Hostess is one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of sweet baked goods including Twinkies&reg;, Ding
	Dongs&reg;, Ho Hos&reg;, Donettes&reg; and a variety of new and classic treats. Hostess's Class&nbsp;A common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol "TWNK" and its

	acquisition opportunities and capitalizing on the ability of our management team to acquire and manage a business that can benefit from our operational expertise. Our management team's approach is
	focused on industries or sectors in which we have considerable knowledge and emphasizes downside protection and the preservation of capital by opportunistically pursuing transactions where we believe
	we have the ability to capture asymmetric risk/reward potential. Our management team has successfully applied this acquisition philosophy over its history to source attractive private equity
	acquisition opportunities and to deploy capital in varying macroeconomic environments. Our management team will assess the skills, qualifications and abilities of the management team of each potential
	business combination target. The level and length of our existing management's continued active participation in our post-acquisition business will depend on the particular needs of the business
	acquired. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.

	network has been developed through our management team's combined history of over 80&nbsp;years of business experience, including in private equity and investment banking. We expect this network
	will provide our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from
	various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Upon completion
	of this offering, members of our management team will communicate with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at
	least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter
	into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent
	investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory
	Authority, or FINRA, or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity
	interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such
	interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination
	if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be
	required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of
	the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to
	the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
	capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders
	immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests
	or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for
	purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in Section&nbsp;2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
	Act, as modified by the Jumpstart
	Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
	that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
	or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding
	advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may
	be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, Section&nbsp;107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B)
	of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
	would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year (a)&nbsp;following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering,
	(b)&nbsp;in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0&nbsp;billion, or (c)&nbsp;in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our
	Class&nbsp;A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700&nbsp;million as of the prior June&nbsp;30th, and (2)&nbsp;the date on which we have issued more than $1.0&nbsp;billion

	If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
	warrants to do so on a "cashless basis." In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a "cashless basis," our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding
	and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that
	number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)&nbsp;the product of the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the
	warrants and the "fair market value" (defined below) by (y)&nbsp;the fair market value. The "fair market value" shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class&nbsp;A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day
	prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. Please see the section of this prospectus entitled "Description of Securities&#151;Warrants&#151;Public Stockholders' Warrants" for additional

	On August&nbsp;19, 2016, our sponsor purchased 10,781,250 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share.
	Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by our sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company
	by the aggregate number of founder shares issued. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after this offering. As such, our initial stockholders
	will collectively own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). In January 2017, our sponsor transferred 25,000 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees
	at their original purchase price. Up to 1,406,250 founder shares will be subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised so that our initial stockholders will maintain
	ownership of 20% of our common stock after this offering.

	If holders of private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for
	that number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)&nbsp;the product of the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price
	of the warrants and the "fair market value" (defined below) by (y)&nbsp;the fair market value. The "fair market value" shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class&nbsp;A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third
	trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that we have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted
	transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they will be affiliated with us following a business combination. If they remain affiliated with us, their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited. We
	expect to have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our securities, an insider cannot trade in our
	securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public stockholders who could sell the shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants freely in the open market, the insiders
	could be significantly restricted from doing so. As a result, we believe that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate.

	If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses or we are considering an initial business
	combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the
	post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the
	post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons. However, we will only complete such
	business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an
	investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest
	in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by
	the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test, provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one
	target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking
	stockholder approval, as applicable.

	We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i)&nbsp;in connection with a
	stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii)&nbsp;by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us,
	solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirements.
	Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend
	our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or
	stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.

	If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common
	stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all
	outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in
	favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained.
	As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders' founder shares, we would need 14,062,501 or approximately 37.5%, of the 37,500,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are
	voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised). We intend to give not less than 10&nbsp;days nor more than 60&nbsp;days prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at
	which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each
	public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.

	We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold
	their shares in "street name," to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal
	to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the
	need for further communication or action from the redeeming public stockholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed business combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target
	company, we will promptly return any certificates delivered, or shares tendered electronically, by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares.

	Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct
	redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other
	person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a "group" (as defined under Section&nbsp;13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in this
	offering. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management
	to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to
	exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder's shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders' ability to
	redeem to no more than 20% of the shares sold in this offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a
	business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders' ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares
	held by those stockholders that hold more than 20% of the shares sold in this offering) for or against our business combination.

	Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain charter provisions. Our amended
	and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust
	account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon, and
	corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. In all other instances, our amended and restated
	certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon, subject to applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, or applicable stock exchange rules. Our
	initial stockholders, who will collectively beneficially own 20% of our common stock upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated
	certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Our sponsor, executive officers, and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any
	amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the
	closing of this offering, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
	in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed
	to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.

	On the completion of our initial business combination, all amounts held in the trust account will be released to us. We will use these funds
	to pay amounts due to any public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights as described above under "Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination," to pay the underwriters their deferred
	underwriting commissions, to pay all or a portion of the consideration payable to the target or owners of the target of our initial business combination and to pay other expenses associated with our initial business combination. If our initial
	business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination, we may apply the balance of the
	cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our
	initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

	The Gores Group manages several investment vehicles. Funds managed by Gores or its affiliates may compete with us for
	acquisition opportunities. If these funds decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Gores, including by Mr.&nbsp;Gores, may be suitable for both us and
	for a current or future Gores fund and may be directed to such investment vehicle rather than to us. Neither Gores nor members of our management team who are also employed by certain affiliates of The Gores Group have any obligation to present us
	with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware, unless presented to such member solely in his or her capacity as an officer of the company. Gores and/or our management, in their capacities as officers or managing
	directors of Gores or in their other endeavors, may be required to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future Gores investment vehicles, or third parties, before they present such opportunities
	to us.

	Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to
	other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for
	an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties
	or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate
	opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to

	Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor (other than our independent public
	accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i)&nbsp;$10.00 per public
	share or (ii)&nbsp;such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to
	fund our working capital requirements or pay our franchise and income tax obligations. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and
	except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third
	party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our
	sponsor's only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors
	and prospective target businesses.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a newly formed company that has conducted no operations and has generated no revenues. Until we complete our initial business
	combination, we will have no operations and will generate no operating revenues. In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the background of
	our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company. This offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule&nbsp;419 promulgated under the Securities Act.
	Accordingly, you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule&nbsp;419 blank check offerings. For additional information concerning how Rule&nbsp;419 blank check
	offerings differ from this offering, please see the section of this prospectus entitled "Proposed Business&#151;Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to
	Rule&nbsp;419." You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section of this prospectus entitled "Risk Factors."

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition
	that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise
	their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our
	public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC's "penny stock" rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash
	requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible
	assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and
	may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.

	agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the
	cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may
	need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive

	National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to
	as "covered securities." Because we expect that our units and eventually our Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ, our units, Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants will
	be covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of
	fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these
	powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and
	might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on NASDAQ, our securities would
	not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.

	execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
	agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our business combination within the
	prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived
	that may be brought against us within the 10&nbsp;years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per share
	initially held in the
	trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor (other than our independent public accountants) for
	services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below
	(i)&nbsp;$10.00 per public share or (ii)&nbsp;such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of
	the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to fund our working capital requirements or pay our franchise and income tax obligations. This liability will not apply with
	respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this
	offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our
	sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity
	obligations and believe that our sponsor's only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you
	that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination
	and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per
	share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective
	target businesses.

	of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in
	United States "government securities" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180&nbsp;days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
	conditions under Rule&nbsp;2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not
	permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for
	the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an "investment company" within the meaning of the
	Investment Company Act. This offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding
	place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i)&nbsp;the completion of our primary business objective, which is a business combination; (ii)&nbsp;the redemption of any public shares properly
	tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if
	we do not complete our initial business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of this offering; or (iii)&nbsp;absent a business combination, our return of the funds held in the trust
	account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If
	we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions
	received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial
	business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of this offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set
	forth in Section&nbsp;280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be
	brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to
	stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder's pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the
	stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably
	possible following the 24th&nbsp;month from the closing of this offering in the event we do not complete our business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing
	procedures.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
	we will not be complying with Section&nbsp;280, Section&nbsp;281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our
	payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10&nbsp;years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company,
	rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as
	lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section&nbsp;281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a
	liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder's pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be
	barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could
	potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date.

	or approximately $0.002 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after this
	offering. In January 2017, our sponsor transferred 25,000 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at their original purchase price. The founder shares will be worthless if we do
	not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor has committed to purchase an aggregate of 6,333,334 (or 7,083,334 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in
	full) private placement warrants, each exercisable for one share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock at $11.50 per share, for a purchase price of approximately $9,500,000 (or $10,625,000 if the
	underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), or $1.50 per whole warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete a business combination. Holders of founder shares have agreed
	(A)&nbsp;to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination and (B)&nbsp;not to redeem any founder shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed
	initial business combination. In addition, we may obtain loans from our sponsor, affiliates of our sponsor or an officer or director, and we may pay our sponsor, officers, directors and any of their

	pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of 65% of our common
	stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions,
	including those which relate to a company's pre-business combination activity, without approval by a certain percentage of the company's stockholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions
	requires approval by between 90% and 100% of the company's public stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business
	combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified
	circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon, and corresponding
	provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. In all other
	instances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon, subject to applicable provisions of
	the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. Our initial stockholders, who will collectively beneficially own up to 20% of our common stock upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not
	purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any
	manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than
	some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of
	our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

	us to complete our initial business combination, because we have not yet identified any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the
	net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available
	net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from stockholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business
	combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed
	business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to
	complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business
	candidate. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in
	the trust account and not previously released to us to fund our working capital requirements or pay our franchise and income taxes on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire

	failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required
	to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial

	We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of
	certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply
	with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
	and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our
	stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to
	five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700&nbsp;million as of
	any June&nbsp;30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities
	less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities
	may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
	Section&nbsp;102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private
	companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply
	with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to
	non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or
	revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or
	revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of
	using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our
	Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2017. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to comply
	with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will
	not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company
	makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target
	company with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of

	A
	portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. On
	August&nbsp;19, 2016, we borrowed $150,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This amount will be repaid upon completion of this
	offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in the trust account.
	In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more
	than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

	The
	underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial business
	combination, $13,125,000, which constitutes the underwriters' deferred commissions (or $15,093,750 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
	from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our
	initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund
	the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

	acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of
	undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
	and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor, members
	of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the public offering price per share of Class&nbsp;A common stock, assuming no value is attributed to the
	warrants included in the units we are offering pursuant to this prospectus or the private placement warrants, and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock
	after this offering constitutes the dilution to investors in this offering. Such calculation does not reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of warrants, including the private
	placement warrants, which would cause the actual dilution to the public stockholders to be higher, particularly where a cashless exercise is utilized. Net tangible book value per share is determined
	by dividing our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities (including the value of Class&nbsp;A common stock which may be redeemed for cash), by the number of
	outstanding shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock.

	Class&nbsp;A common stock included in the units we are offering by this prospectus, the sale of the private placement warrants and the deduction of underwriting commissions and estimated expenses of
	this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value at September&nbsp;30, 2016 would have been $5,000,009, or approximately $0.45 per share, representing an immediate increase in net tangible book
	value (as decreased by the value of the approximately 35,797,551 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock that may be redeemed for cash and assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment
	option) of $9.57 per share to our initial stockholders as of the date of this prospectus and an immediate dilution of $10.00 per share or 100% to our public stockholders not exercising their
	redemption rights. Total dilution to public stockholders from this offering will be $9.55 per share. The dilution to new investors if the underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in full would

	price equal to the amount in the trust account as set forth in our tender offer or proxy materials (initially anticipated to be the aggregate amount held in trust two days prior to the commencement of
	our tender offer or stockholders meeting, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to fund our working capital requirements or pay our

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our liquidity needs have been satisfied prior to the completion of this offering through receipt of $25,000 from the sale of the
	founder shares to our sponsor and loans to us of up to $300,000 by our sponsor under an unsecured promissory note. On August&nbsp;19, 2016, we borrowed $150,000 under the unsecured promissory note
	to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. We estimate that the net proceeds from (i)&nbsp;the sale of the units in this offering, after deducting offering expenses of approximately
	$900,000, underwriting commissions of $7,500,000 ($8,625,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of $13,125,000 (or
	$15,093,750 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full)), and (ii)&nbsp;the sale of the private placement warrants for a purchase price of approximately $9,500,000 (or
	$10,625,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be $376,100,000 (or $432,350,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of this amount, $375,000,000 (or
	$431,250,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be held in the trust account, which includes $13,125,000 (or $15,093,750 if the underwriters' over-allotment option
	is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions. The remaining approximately $1,100,000 will not be held in the trust account. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of
	$900,000, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding
	amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $900,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding
	amount.

	commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to fund our working capital requirements and pay franchise and income taxes. We estimate our annual franchise tax
	obligations, based on the number of shares of our common stock authorized and outstanding after the completion of this offering, to be $180,000, which is the maximum amount of annual franchise taxes
	payable by us as a Delaware corporation per annum. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account. Based on
	assumed interest rates, we expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes. To the extent that our capital stock or debt
	is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations
	of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
	to the completion of our initial business combination, we will have available to us the approximately $1,100,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account. We will use these funds
	to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target
	businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or
	certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event
	that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account
	would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the
	private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
	agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to
	loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $300,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with
	structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations; $125,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; $480,000 for office space, utilities and
	secretarial and administrative support; $125,000 for consulting, travel and miscellaneous expenses incurred during the search for a business combination target; and approximately $70,000 for working
	capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves (including franchise taxes net of anticipated interest income).

	financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a "no-shop" provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from "shopping"
	around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business

	costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient
	funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become
	obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such
	business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to
	complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our
	initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;19, 2016, our sponsor purchased 10,781,250 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately
	$0.002 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares upon completion of this offering.
	The per share purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the aggregate number of founder shares issued. In January 2017, our

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain
	reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an "emerging growth company" and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements
	based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or

	the JOBS Act, if, as an "emerging growth company", we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i)&nbsp;provide an auditor's attestation report on our system
	of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section&nbsp;404, (ii)&nbsp;provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under

	auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv)&nbsp;disclose certain executive compensation related items
	such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years
	following the completion of this offering or until we are no longer an "emerging growth company," whichever is earlier.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger,
	capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial
	business combination. We have not identified any potential business combination target and
	we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
	we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and manage a
	business that can benefit from our operational expertise, as members of our management team have done in diverse sectors, including industrials, technology, telecommunications, media and
	entertainment, business services, healthcare and consumer products. This operationally-oriented investment approach has served The Gores Group well since its founding in 1987.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	believe that our management team is well positioned to identify operationally-oriented acquisition opportunities in the marketplace and that our contacts and transaction sources,
	ranging from owners and directors of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, lenders, attorneys, accountants and other trusted advisors across various sectors, will
	allow us to generate attractive acquisition opportunities. Our team is led by Alec Gores, our Chairman, who has more than 35&nbsp;years of experience as an entrepreneur, operator and private equity
	investor. Over the course of his career, Mr.&nbsp;Gores and his team have invested in more than 100 portfolio companies through varying macroeconomic environments with a consistent,
	operationally-oriented investment strategy.

	when he founded The Gores Group in 1987. Since then, the firm has acquired more than 100 businesses including a current portfolio of more than 20 active companies worldwide. Under
	Mr.&nbsp;Gores' leadership, The Gores Group has effected a number of successful corporate carve-out acquisitions over the last two decades. The Gores Group acquired VeriFone from Hewlett-Packard
	Company at a time when the business was generating significant revenues, but was cash flow negative. The Gores Group implemented dramatic changes to the business, and the business was sold and
	subsequently went public with an operating partner from The Gores Group serving as its chief executive officer. During that same timeframe, The Gores Group acquired The Learning Company from Mattel
	Corporation and transformed that business which, similarly, was generating significant revenues, but was suffering from severely negative cash flow. Since then, with Mr.&nbsp;Gores leading the firm,
	The Gores Group has created significant value in numerous transactions, including the acquisitions of Global Tel*Link from Schlumberger&nbsp;Ltd., Stock Building Supply from Wolseley&nbsp;plc,
	Therakos from Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, the electronics power systems business from TE Connectivity&nbsp;Ltd., Siemens Enterprise Communications from Siemens AG and Sagem Communications from the
	Safran Group, among others. Mr.&nbsp;Gores began his career as a self-made entrepreneur and operating executive. In 1978, he self-funded and founded Executive Business Systems (EBS), a developer and
	distributor of vertical business software systems. Within seven years, EBS had become a leading value-added reseller in Michigan and employed over 200 people. In 1986, CONTEL purchased EBS, and
	Mr.&nbsp;Gores subsequently began acquiring and operating non-core businesses from major corporations and building value in those entities, a decision that ultimately led to the founding of what has
	evolved into The Gores Group today. Under his leadership, The Gores Group has continued to acquire businesses in need of operational and financial resources, while creating value and working with
	management teams to establish an entrepreneurial environment as a foundation for sustainable growth. As of March&nbsp;31, 2016, The Gores Group had approximately $2.5&nbsp;billion in assets under
	management.

	management team's objective is to generate attractive investment returns to create value for our stockholders by applying our strategy of identifying operationally-oriented
	acquisition opportunities and capitalizing on the ability of our management team to acquire and manage a business that can benefit from our operational expertise. Our management team's approach is
	focused on industries or sectors in which we have considerable knowledge and emphasizes downside protection and the preservation of capital by opportunistically pursuing transactions where we believe
	we have the ability to capture asymmetric risk/reward potential. Our management team has successfully applied this acquisition philosophy over its history to source attractive private equity
	acquisition opportunities and to deploy capital in varying macroeconomic environments. Our management team will assess the skills, qualifications and abilities of the management team of each potential
	business combination target. The level and length of our existing management's continued active participation in our post-acquisition business will depend on the particular needs of the business
	acquired. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at
	least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter
	into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent
	investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.

	anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity
	interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such
	interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination
	if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be
	required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of
	the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to
	the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
	capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
	once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the
	underwriters' ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation
	consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders' interests.
	It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company's profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment
	market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such
	unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited
	basis, since many of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our
	attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade
	shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as
	a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business
	acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder's fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an
	arm's length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not
	otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder's fees
	is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In addition, we may pay our sponsor or any of our existing
	officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, a finder's fee, consulting fee or other compensation in connection with identifying, investigating and completing our initial
	business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and
	administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and
	directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will
	not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.

	combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is

	Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at
	least 80% of our assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter
	into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial
	community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we
	will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not
	intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted
	flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or
	a similar company with nominal operations.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a
	controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity
	interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the
	80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination.

	terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in
	possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation&nbsp;M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a
	contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.
	In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise
	their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would
	constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers
	determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If

	all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote their founder shares and any
	public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted,
	non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders' founder shares, we would need
	14,062,501 or approximately 37.5%, of the 37,500,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial
	business combination approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised). We intend to give not less than 10&nbsp;days nor more than 60&nbsp;days prior written notice of any such
	meeting, if required, at which a vote
	shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate

	working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii)&nbsp;the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event

	Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
</I>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their
	shares in "street name," to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two
	business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using
	Depository Trust Company's DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder's option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public
	shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would
	have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials,
	as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of
	their public shares.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
	is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will
	typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or
	not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such
	delivery must be effectuated.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check
	companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders' vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the
	proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the
	company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an "option window" after the completion of
	the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company's stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in
	the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were

	connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and
	liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of
	$900,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a
	corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $900,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a
	corresponding amount.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
	the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion
	of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing
	of this offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;280 of the DGCL intended to ensure
	that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which
	the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a
	liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder's pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred
	after the third anniversary of the dissolution.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business
	combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of this offering, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then
	pursuant to Section&nbsp;174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the
	case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination within 24&nbsp;months from the closing of this offering, we will: (i)&nbsp;cease all operations except for
	the purpose of winding up, (ii)&nbsp;as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the
	aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to fund our working capital requirements or pay
	our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
	public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)&nbsp;as promptly as reasonably possible
	following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to
	provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we will not be complying with Section&nbsp;280, Section&nbsp;281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our
	payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10&nbsp;years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an
	operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment
	bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than
	our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
	monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any
	liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below
	(i)&nbsp;$10.00 per public share or (ii)&nbsp;such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of
	the trust assets, in each case net of the
	amount of interest withdrawn to fund our working capital requirements or pay our franchise and income tax obligations and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of
	this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will
	not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
	we file&nbsp;a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to
	applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy
	claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file&nbsp;a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary
	bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a
	"preferential transfer" or a "fraudulent conveyance." As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having
	breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust
	account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

	stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder's voting in

	contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC's proxy rules. If, however, we hold a stockholder vote, we will, like many blank check

	stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. A quorum for such meeting will
	consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from
	other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic
	acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these
	competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This
	inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders
	who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may
	not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	has been our Chairman since August 2016. Mr.&nbsp;Gores is the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Gores
	Group, a global investment firm focused on acquiring businesses that can benefit from the firm's operating expertise. Mr.&nbsp;Gores pioneered a new operational approach to private equity investing
	when he founded The Gores Group in 1987. Since then, the firm has acquired more than 100 businesses including a current portfolio of more than 20 active companies worldwide. Mr.&nbsp;Gores began his
	career as a self-made entrepreneur and operating executive. In 1978, he self-funded and founded Executive Business
	Systems (EBS), a developer and distributor of vertical business software systems. Within seven years, EBS had become a leading value-added reseller in Michigan and employed over 200 people. In 1986,
	CONTEL purchased EBS, and Mr.&nbsp;Gores subsequently began acquiring and operating non-core businesses from major corporations and building value in those entities, a decision that ultimately led
	to the founding of what has evolved into The Gores Group today. Under his leadership, The Gores Group has continued to acquire businesses in need of operational and financial resources, while creating
	value and working with management teams to establish an entrepreneurial environment as a foundation for sustainable growth. This philosophy has served the firm well. Mr.&nbsp;Gores also served as
	the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Gores Holdings I (Nasdaq: GRSH) from its inception in June 2015 until completion of the Hostess acquisition in November 2016. Mr.&nbsp;Gores holds a degree
	in Computer Science from Western Michigan University. Mr.&nbsp;Gores' significant investment and financial expertise make him well qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors.

	to such member solely in his or her capacity as an officer of the company. Gores and/or our management, in their capacities as officers or managing directors of Gores or in their other endeavors, may

	for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity.
	We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and

	whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We will purchase a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense,

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These

	may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;19, 2016, our sponsor purchased 10,781,250 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. In January 2017, our sponsor
	transferred 25,000 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at their original purchase price. The following table presents the number of shares and percentage of our common stock
	owned by our initial stockholders before and after this offering. The post-offering numbers and percentages presented assume that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option, that our
	sponsor forfeits 1,406,250 founder shares, and that there are 46,875,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding after this offering.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;19, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 10,781,250 founder shares to our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of
	$25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.002 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares
	upon completion of this offering. In January 2017, our sponsor transferred 25,000 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at their original purchase price. Up to 1,406,250 founder
	shares are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised. The founder shares (including the Class&nbsp;A common stock
	issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	sponsor has committed, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase an aggregate of 6,333,334 (or 7,083,334 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement
	warrants for a purchase price of $1.50 per whole warrant in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. As such, our sponsor's interest in this transaction is
	valued at between approximately $9,500,000 and $10,625,000, depending on the number of private placement warrants purchased. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of
	our Class&nbsp;A common stock at $11.50 per share. The private placement warrants (including the Class&nbsp;A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited
	exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.

	contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over

	support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. In addition, we may pay our sponsor or any of our existing officers or
	directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, a finder's fee, consulting fee or other compensation in connection with identifying, investigating and completing our initial business
	combination. These individuals will also be reimbursed for any out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
	performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their
	affiliates and will determine which fees and expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on payments that may be made to our sponsor, officers, directors or
	any of their respective affiliates.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior

	with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one whole share of Class&nbsp;A common stock and one-third of one warrant.
	Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. Pursuant
	to the warrant agreement, a warrantholder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock. This means that only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given
	time by a warrantholder. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase at least three units, you will not be
	able to receive or trade a whole warrant.

	Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd&nbsp;day following the closing of this offering unless Deutsche Bank
	Securities&nbsp;Inc. informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form&nbsp;8-K described below and having issued a press release
	announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or
	separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock and

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

	completion of this offering, which is anticipated to take place three business days after the date of this prospectus. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised following the initial

	directors will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting
	with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Our stockholders are

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	accordance with NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until no later than one year after our first fiscal year end following our
	listing on NASDAQ. Under Section&nbsp;211(b) of the DGCL, we are, however, required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our
	bylaws, unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial
	business combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section&nbsp;211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting
	prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with
	Section&nbsp;211(c) of the DGCL.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price,
	payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination including interest earned on
	the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to fund our working capital requirements or pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public
	shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to
	investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter
	agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our
	business combination. Unlike many blank check companies that hold stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and provide for related
	redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, if a stockholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide
	to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules

	transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a
	proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the
	outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding
	capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. However, the participation of our
	sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates in privately-negotiated transactions (as described in this prospectus), if any, could result in the approval of our business combination even
	if a majority
	of our public stockholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock
	voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our business combination once a quorum is obtained. We intend to give not less than 10&nbsp;days nor more than 60&nbsp;days prior written
	notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders,

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
	we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our
	amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in
	concert or as a "group" (as defined under Section&nbsp;13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares of common
	stock sold in this offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders' ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against
	our business combination. Our stockholders' inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our business combination, and such stockholders could suffer
	a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such stockholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if
	we complete the business combination. And, as a result, such stockholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 20% and, in order to dispose such shares would be required to sell their
	stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.

	37,500,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
	we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its warrant to do so on a "cashless
	basis." In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a "cashless basis," our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants
	that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. If our management
	takes advantage of this option, all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock equal to the quotient
	obtained by dividing (x)&nbsp;the product of the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and
	the "fair market value" (defined below) by (y)&nbsp;the fair market value. The "fair market value" shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class&nbsp;A common stock for the 10
	trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, the notice of
	redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock to be received upon exercise of the warrants, including the "fair market value" in
	such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. We believe this feature is an
	attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after our initial business combination. If we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take
	advantage of this option, our sponsor and its permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula
	described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, as described in more detail below.

	after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person's affiliates), to the warrant agent's actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (or such other amount as a

	we have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they
	will be affiliated with us following a business combination. If they remain affiliated with us, their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited. We expect to have
	policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our securities, an
	insider cannot trade in our securities if he
	or she is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public stockholders who could sell the shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our
	units, our Class&nbsp;A common stock and our warrants, which we refer to collectively as our securities. Because the components of a unit (consisting of one share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock
	and of one-third of one warrant) are separable at the option of the holder, the holder of a unit generally should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the owner of the underlying
	Class&nbsp;A common stock and one-third of one warrant components of the unit, as the case may be. As a result, the discussion below with respect to actual holders of Class&nbsp;A common stock and
	warrants should also apply to holders of units (as the deemed owners of the underlying Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants that comprise the units). This discussion applies only to securities
	that are held as a capital asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is applicable only to holders who purchased units in this offering.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending
	on the date and size of our initial business combination, it is possible that at least 60% of our adjusted ordinary gross income may consist of PHC income as discussed above.
	In addition, depending on the concentration of our stock in the hands of individuals, including the members of our sponsor and certain tax-exempt organizations, pension funds and charitable trusts, it
	is possible and, with respect to our taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016, we believe, quite likely that more than 50% of our stock may be owned or deemed owned (pursuant to the constructive
	ownership rules) by such persons during the last half of a taxable year. Thus, no assurance can be given that we will not become a PHC following this offering or in the future. If we are or were to
	become a PHC in a given taxable year, we would be subject to an additional PHC tax, currently 20%, on our undistributed PHC income, which generally includes our taxable income, subject to certain

	Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes and, therefore, such treatment is not entirely clear. The acquisition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of
	our Class&nbsp;A common stock and one-third of one warrant to acquire one share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. We intend to treat the acquisition of a unit in this manner and, by purchasing a
	unit, you will agree to adopt such treatment for tax purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between
	the one share of Class&nbsp;A common stock and the one-third of one warrant based on their respective relative fair market value of each at the time of issuance. The price allocated to each share of
	Class&nbsp;A common stock and the one-third of one warrant should be the stockholder's tax basis in such share or one-third of one warrant, as the case may be. Any disposition of a unit should be
	treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the share of Class&nbsp;A common stock and the one-third of one warrant constituting the unit, and the amount realized on the
	disposition should be allocated between the Class&nbsp;A common stock and the one-third of one warrant based on their respective fair market values at the time of disposition. The separation of
	shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants constituting units should not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	foregoing treatment of the units, shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants and a holder's purchase price allocation are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the
	"IRS") or the courts. Because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the
	characterization described above or the discussion below. Accordingly, each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit
	(including alternative characterizations of a unit). The balance of this discussion assumes that the characterization of the units described above is respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we pay cash distributions to U.S. holders of shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, such distributions generally will constitute
	dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as
	determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce
	(but not below zero) the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in our Class&nbsp;A common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the
	Class&nbsp;A common stock and will be treated as described under "U.S. Holders&#151;Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and

	we pay to a U.S. holder that is a taxable corporation generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction if the requisite holding period is satisfied. With certain
	exceptions (including, dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment interest deduction limitations), and provided certain holding period requirements are met, dividends we pay to
	a non-corporate U.S. holder generally will constitute "qualified dividends" that will be taxed at the applicable rate for long-term capital gains. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with
	respect to the Class&nbsp;A common stock described in this prospectus may prevent a U.S. holder from satisfying the applicable holding period requirements with respect to the dividends received
	deduction or the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income, as the case may be.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, taxable exchange or taxable disposition of our Class&nbsp;A common
	stock or warrants (including on our dissolution and liquidation if we do not complete an initial business combination within the required time period). Any such gain or loss generally will be capital
	gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period for such Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants exceeds one year. It is unclear, however,
	whether the redemption rights with respect to the Class&nbsp;A common stock described in this prospectus may suspend the running of the applicable holding period for this purpose. Long-term capital

	Redemption of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock
</I>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a U.S. holder's Class&nbsp;A common stock is redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this
	prospectus under the section of this prospectus entitled "Description of Securities&#151;Common Stock" or if we purchase a U.S. holder's Class&nbsp;A common stock in an open market
	transaction, the treatment of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption or purchase by us qualifies as sale of the Class&nbsp;A common stock under
	Section&nbsp;302 of the Code. If the redemption or purchase by us qualifies as a sale of common stock, the U.S. holder will be treated as described under "U.S. Holders&#151;Gain or Loss on
	Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Warrants" above. If the redemption or purchase by us does not qualify as a sale of common stock, the U.S. holder
	will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences described above under "U.S. Holders&#151;Taxation of Distributions". Whether a redemption or purchase by us
	qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of shares of our stock treated as held by the U.S. holder (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S. holder as a result
	of owning warrants) relative to all of our shares outstanding both before and after the redemption. A redemption or purchase by us of Class&nbsp;A common stock generally will be treated as a sale of
	the Class&nbsp;A common stock (rather than as a distribution) if the redemption or purchase by us (i)&nbsp;is "substantially disproportionate" with respect to the U.S. holder, (ii)&nbsp;results
	in a "complete termination" of the U.S. holder's interest in us or (iii)&nbsp;is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with respect to the U.S. holder. These tests are explained more fully
	below.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied, a U.S. holder takes into account not only stock actually owned by the U.S. holder, but also shares of our stock that are
	constructively owned by it. A U.S. holder may constructively own, in addition to stock owned directly, stock owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S. holder has an interest
	or that have an interest in such U.S. holder, as well as any stock the U.S. holder
	has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include Class&nbsp;A common stock which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants. In order to meet the
	"substantially disproportionate test" the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder immediately following such redemption or purchase must, among
	other requirements, be less than 80% of the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder immediately before such redemption or purchase. There will
	be a "complete termination" of a U.S. holder's interest if either (i)&nbsp;all of the shares of our stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder are redeemed or (ii)&nbsp;all of the
	shares of our stock actually owned by the U.S. holder are redeemed and the U.S. holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of stock owned by
	certain family members and the U.S. holder does not constructively own any other stock. The redemption or purchase by us of the

	Class&nbsp;A
	common stock will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if a U.S. holder's conversion results in a "meaningful reduction" of the U.S. holder's proportionate interest in us.
	Whether the redemption or purchase by us will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. holder's proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS
	has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate
	affairs may constitute such a "meaningful reduction." A U.S. holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption purchase by us.

	Exercise or Lapse of a Warrant

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as described below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant, a U.S. holder generally will not recognize gain or loss
	on the acquisition of common stock upon exercise of a warrant for cash. The U.S. holder's tax basis in the share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock received upon exercise of the warrant generally will
	equal the sum of the U.S. holder's initial investment in the warrant (i.e.,&nbsp;the portion of the U.S. holder's
	purchase price for units that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under "Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit") and the exercise price. It is unclear whether a U.S.
	holder's holding period for the Class&nbsp;A common stock received upon exercise of the warrant will begin on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the
	warrant; however, in either case, the holding period will not include the period during which the U.S. holder held the warrant. If a warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. holder generally
	will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder's tax basis in the warrant.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current tax law. A cashless exercise may be tax free, either because the exercise is not a gain realization
	event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In either tax free situation, a U.S. holder's basis in the Class&nbsp;A common stock received
	would equal the holder's basis in the warrant. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a gain realization event, a U.S. holder's holding period in the Class&nbsp;A common stock would be
	treated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly the date of exercise) of the warrant. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of
	the Class&nbsp;A common stock would include the holding period of the warrant.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
	is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In such event, a U.S. holder could be deemed to
	have surrendered warrants equal to the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock having a value equal to the exercise price for the total number of warrants to be exercised. The U.S. holder
	would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Class&nbsp;A common stock represented by the warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S.
	holder's tax basis in the warrants deemed surrendered. In this case, a U.S. holder's tax basis in the Class&nbsp;A common stock received would equal the sum of the fair market value of the
	Class&nbsp;A common stock represented by the warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. holder's tax basis in the warrants exercised. A U.S. holder's holding

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock for which the warrant may be
	exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this prospectus entitled "Description of Securities&#151;Warrants&#151;Public
	Stockholders' Warrants." An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. The U.S. holders of the warrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive
	distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases such U.S. holders' proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g.,&nbsp;through an increase in the number of shares
	of Class&nbsp;A common stock that would be obtained upon exercise) as a result of a distribution of cash to the holders of shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. Such constructive distribution
	to a U.S. holder of warrants would be treated as if such U.S. holders had received a cash distribution from us generally equal to the fair market value of such increased interest (taxed as described
	above under "U.S. Holders&#151;Taxation of Distributions"). For certain informational reporting purposes, we are required to determine the date and amount of any such constructive
	distributions. Recently proposed Treasury regulations, which we may rely on prior to the issuance of final regulations, specify how the date and amount of constructive distributions are determined.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, any distributions (including constructive distributions) we make to a Non-U.S. holder of shares of our Class&nbsp;A
	common stock, to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles), will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes and, provided such dividends are not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United States, we will be required to withhold tax from the
	gross amount of the dividend at a rate of 30%, unless such Non-U.S. holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and provides proper certification of
	its eligibility for such reduced rate (usually on an IRS Form&nbsp;W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable). In the case of any constructive dividend, it is possible that this tax would be withheld from
	any amount owed to a Non-U.S. holder by the applicable withholding agent, including cash distributions on other property or sale proceeds from warrants or other property subsequently paid or credited
	to such holder. Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated first as reducing (but not below zero) the Non-U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of our Class&nbsp;A common
	stock and, to the extent such distribution exceeds the Non-U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis, as gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the Class&nbsp;A common stock, which will be
	treated as described under "Non-U.S. Holders&#151;Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Warrants" below. In addition, if we determine
	that we are likely to be classified as a "U.S. real property holding corporation" (see "Non-U.S. Holders&#151;Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class&nbsp;A
	Common Stock and Warrants" below), we will withhold 15% of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, including a distribution in redemption of the Class&nbsp;A
	common stock. See also "U.S. Holders&#151;Possible Constructive Distributions" for potential U.S. federal tax consequences with respect to constructive distributions.

	are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the Non-U.S. holder) generally will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax, provided such Non-U.S. holder complies with
	certain certification and disclosure requirements (usually by providing an IRS Form&nbsp;W-8ECI). Instead, the effectively connected income will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the
	Non-U.S. holder were a U.S. resident, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. A Non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to an additional

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments of dividends and the proceeds from a sale or other
	disposition of our units, shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants. A Non-U.S. holder may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that it is not a United States person in
	order to avoid information reporting and backup withholding requirements. The certification procedures required to claim a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty will satisfy the certification
	requirements necessary to avoid the backup withholding as well. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a Non-U.S. holder will be allowed as a credit against such holder's U.S. federal
	income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

	FATCA Withholding Taxes

</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions commonly referred to as "FATCA" impose withholding of 30% on payments of dividends (including constructive dividends) on our
	Class&nbsp;A common stock or warrants and, beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2019, sale or other disposition proceeds from our units, shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock and warrants to "foreign
	financial institutions" (which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless various U.S. information reporting and due
	diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied or an exemption applies (typically certified as to by the
	delivery of a properly completed IRS Form&nbsp;W-8BEN-E). If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally will be entitled to a refund of
	any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail
	significant administrative burden). Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different
	rules. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the effects of FATCA on their investment in our securities.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
	to this offering, there has been no public market for our securities. Consequently, the initial public offering price for the units was determined by negotiations between us and

	companies, prior offerings of those companies, our management, our capital structure, and currently prevailing general conditions in equity securities markets, including current market valuations of
	publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company. We cannot assure you, however, that the price at which the units, Class&nbsp;A common stock or warrants will sell in the public market

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Gores Holdings II,&nbsp;Inc. (the "Company") as of September&nbsp;30, 2016, and the related statements of operations, changes in

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
	the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Gores Holdings II,&nbsp;Inc., as of September&nbsp;30,
	2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from August&nbsp;15, 2016 (inception) through September&nbsp;30, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted

	the
	Proposed Offering are intended to be generally applied toward consummating a Business Combination. The Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an
	aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of the Company signing
	a definitive agreement in connection with the Business Combination. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company, after signing a definitive agreement for a Business Combination, will either (i)&nbsp;seek stockholder approval of the Business Combination at a meeting called for such
	purpose in connection with which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Business Combination, for cash equal to their pro rata share of the
	aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable, or (ii)&nbsp;provide
	stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount in cash equal to their pro rata share
	of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable. The decision as
	to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of the Business Combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its
	discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require the Company to seek stockholder approval,
	unless a vote is required by law or under NASDAQ rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval, it will complete its Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common
	stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. However, in no event will the Company redeem its public shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in an amount that would cause its net tangible
	assets to be less than $5,000,001. In such case, the Company would not proceed with the redemption of its public shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock and the related Business Combination, and instead
	may search for an alternate Business Combination.

	an amount in cash equal to its pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including
	interest but less taxes payable. As a result, such shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock will be recorded at redemption amount and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Proposed

	Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with

	accordance with Section&nbsp;102(b)(7) of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, will provide that no director shall be personally liable to us or any of
	our
	stockholders for monetary damages resulting from breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such limitation on or exemption from liability is not permitted under the DGCL
	unless they violated their duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful
	stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from their actions as directors. The effect of this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is
	to eliminate our rights and those of our stockholders (through stockholders' derivative suits on our behalf) to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of the fiduciary duty of care as
	a director, including breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior, except, as restricted by Section&nbsp;102(b)(7) of the DGCL. However, this provision does not limit or
	eliminate our rights or the rights of any stockholder to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a director's duty of care.

	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
	registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of
	expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
	controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court
	of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
	issue.

	The Company may consummate the initial Business Combination and conduct redemptions of shares of Common Stock for cash upon consummation of such Business Combination without a stockholder vote pursuant to Rule&nbsp;13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, including the filing of tender offer documents with the Commission. Such tender offer documents will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under the Commission&#146;s proxy rules&nbsp;and will provide each stockholder of the Company with the opportunity prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination to redeem the shares of Common Stock held by such stockholder for an amount of cash equal to (A)&nbsp;the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, representing (x)&nbsp;the proceeds held in the Trust Account from the Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and (y)&nbsp;any interest income earned on the funds held in the Trust Account not previously released to fund the Company&#146;s working capital requirements or to pay franchise and income taxes, divided by (B)&nbsp;the total number of shares of Common Stock sold as part of the Units in the Offering (the &#147;Public Stock&#148;) then outstanding. If, however, the Company elects not to file such tender offer documents, a stockholder vote is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement in connection with the initial Business Combination or the Company decides to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will submit such Business Combination to the Company&#146;s stockholders for their approval (&#147;Business Combination Vote&#148;). With respect to the initial Business Combination Vote, if any, the Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote all of their Founder Shares and any other shares of Common Stock purchased during or after the Offering in favor of the Company&#146;s initial Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the initial Business Combination, the Company will offer to each Public Stockholder holding shares of Common Stock the right to have its shares redeemed in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules&nbsp;of the Commission at a per share redemption price (the &#147;Redemption Price&#148;) equal to (I)&nbsp;the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, representing (1)&nbsp;the proceeds held in the Trust Account from the Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and (2)&nbsp;any interest income earned on the funds held in the Trust Account not previously released to fund the Company&#146;s working capital requirements or to pay franchise and income taxes, divided by (II)&nbsp;the total number of Public Stock then outstanding. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the initial Business Combination, the Company may proceed with such Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voted by the stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting are voted to approve such Business Combination. If, after seeking and receiving such stockholder approval, the Company elects to so proceed, it will redeem shares, at the Redemption Price, from those Public Stockholders who affirmatively requested such redemption. Only Public Stockholders holding shares of Common Stock who properly exercise their redemption rights, in accordance with the applicable tender offer or proxy materials related to such Business Combination and the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Company, shall be entitled to receive distributions from the Trust Account in connection with an initial Business Combination, and the Company shall pay no distributions with respect to any other holders of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection therewith.

	Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination, the Company and the Representative will jointly direct the Trustee to pay the Representative, on behalf of the Underwriters, the Deferred Discount out of the proceeds of the Offering held in the Trust Account. The Underwriters shall have no claim to payment of any interest earned on the portion of the proceeds held in the Trust Account representing the Deferred Discount. If the Company fails to consummate its initial Business Combination within twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the Offering, the Deferred Discount will not be paid to the Representative and will, instead, be included in the Liquidation distribution of the proceeds held in the Trust Account made to the Public Stockholders. In connection with any such Liquidation, the Underwriters forfeit any rights or claims to the Deferred Discount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a portion of the amount designated per Unit as Deferred Discount may be paid to third parties not participating in the Offering (but who are members of FINRA) that assist the Company in consummating its initial Business Combination. The election to make such payments to third parties will be solely at the discretion of the Company&#146;s management team, and such third parties will be selected by the Company&#146;s management team in their sole and absolute discretion;
<U>
	provided

	Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section&nbsp;8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section&nbsp;8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i)&nbsp;will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of material rights and defenses and (ii)&nbsp;will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party&#146;s choice at the indemnifying party&#146;s expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided,
<U>
	however,
</U>
	that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party&#146;s election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i)&nbsp;the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii)&nbsp;the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii)&nbsp;the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv)&nbsp;the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless (i)&nbsp;such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii)&nbsp;does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i)&nbsp;such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii)&nbsp;such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii)&nbsp;such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.

	In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively &#147;Losses&#148;) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the Offering;
<U>
	provided, however,
</U>
	that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the Offering) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the Offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page&nbsp;of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph&nbsp;(d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f)&nbsp;of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

	that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the Underwritten Securities, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities. If within one Business Day after such default relating to more than 10% of the Underwritten Securities the remaining Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Underwritten Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of one Business Day within which to procure another party or parties reasonably satisfactory to you to purchase said Underwritten Securities. In the event that neither the remaining Underwriters nor the Company purchase or arrange for the purchase of all of the Underwritten Securities to which a default relates as provided in this Section&nbsp;9, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section&nbsp;9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
