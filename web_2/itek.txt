	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical-stage
	biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Glaucoma is a disease of the eye that is typically characterized by structural evidence of optic nerve
	damage, vision loss and consistently elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP. Our lead product candidate,
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	, is a first-in-class selective adenosine mimetic that we rationally designed to lower IOP by restoring the eye&#146;s natural
	pressure control mechanism. We developed this molecule to selectively stimulate a particular adenosine subreceptor in the eye with the effect of augmenting the intrinsic function of the eye&#146;s trabecular meshwork, or TM. The TM regulates the
	pressure inside the eye and is also the main outflow path for the fluid inside of the eye that often builds up pressure in patients with glaucoma. We believe that by restoring the natural function of the TM and this outflow path, rather than
	changing the fundamental dynamics of pressure regulation in the eye,
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	&#146;s mechanism of action should result in a lower risk of unintended side effects and long term safety issues than other mechanisms of action. Additionally,
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	&#146;s unique mechanism of action in the TM should complement the activity of existing glaucoma therapies that exert their IOP-lowering effects on different parts of the in-flow and out-flow system of the eye.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our product pipeline includes
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	monotherapy delivered in an eye drop formulation, as well as a fixed-dose combination, or
	FDC, of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	with
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	given once-daily, or QD. We are also evaluating the potential of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	to slow the loss of vision associated with glaucoma and degenerative retinal diseases. Statistically significant
	results for the primary endpoint of our completed Phase 2 clinical trial indicate that
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	monotherapy has IOP-lowering effects in line with existing therapies, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile at all doses tested.
	Our completed Phase 2 trial of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	co-administered with
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	, a prostaglandin analogue, or PGA, demonstrated IOP-lowering in patients who have previously had inadequate responses to treatment with
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	.
	These patients represent PGA poor-responders, as evidenced by persistently elevated IOP at levels that typically require the addition of a second drug to further lower IOP.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in 2015 to discuss our Phase 3 program for
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	monotherapy, and to confirm the
	design and endpoints for the Phase 3 pivotal trials. At the meeting, we reached agreement on the design of our initial Phase 3 study, as well as the overall regulatory path for
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	. We started our Phase 3 program for
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	monotherapy in October 2015, and, based on our estimate of the rate of patient enrollment, we expect to report top-line data from the first pivotal trial in the program by late 2016. If the primary objectives of all of the trials
	in our Phase&nbsp;3 program are met, we plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA for marketing approval of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	for the treatment of glaucoma in the United States. We plan to submit a marketing authorization
	application, or MAA, in Europe after filing our NDA for approval of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	in the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	According to IMS Health
	sales of glaucoma drugs in 2013 were approximately $2.0 billion in the United&nbsp;States and $5.6 billion worldwide. According to the British Journal of Ophthalmology, there were an estimated 2.8&nbsp;million Americans with glaucoma in 2010. Once
	glaucoma develops, it is a chronic condition that requires life-long treatment. PGAs are the most widely prescribed drug class for glaucoma and include the most widely prescribed glaucoma drug,
<I>
	latanoprost.
</I>
	When PGA monotherapy is
	insufficient to control IOP or is poorly tolerated, non-PGA products, such as beta blockers, alpha agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, are generally used either as an add-on therapy to the PGA or as an alternative monotherapy. Both PGAs and
	non-PGAs can cause adverse effects in the eye. In addition, non-PGA drugs can have adverse effects in the rest of the body and have been shown to have poor tolerability profiles. As a result, we believe there is a significant unmet need for a
	treatment that effectively lowers IOP by restoring outflow and the natural pressure control by the TM, that has a favorable safety and tolerability profile, and that works effectively in combination with other treatments.

	Additionally, no existing treatments offer the potential to directly treat the underlying cause
	of glaucoma associated vision loss: the death of retinal ganglion cells, or RGCs, the nerve tissue in the retina that relays the visual signal to the brain. We believe that a drug with the potential to make these cells more resilient to the stress
	caused by glaucoma would achieve broad market acceptance as the treatment preferred among patients and physicians.

	. As many as half of glaucoma patients, typically those with
	more severe disease, need to use two or more glaucoma drugs to sufficiently reduce their IOP. The initial treatment for glaucoma patients is usually the use of a prescription eye drop from the PGA drug class. However, as PGAs are often unable to
	lower IOP sufficiently to reach the patient&#146;s medically targeted level, non-PGA products are used either as an add-on therapy to the PGA or as an alternative monotherapy in place of PGAs. There are currently no FDC products approved for use in

	The eye is a fibrous sack which must stay &#147;inflated&#148; with a fluid that maintains the eye&#146;s form, known as aqueous humor, at the
	proper pressure in order to maintain its shape and effectively focus light to the retina where the light stimulus is then relayed to the brain and converted into a visual image. To maintain the eye&#146;s pressure&#151;and therefore its
	shape&#151;and as a means to provide nutrients to eye tissue, aqueous humor is constantly produced inside the eye by a tissue known as the ciliary body. The ciliary body sits just behind the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. Aqueous humor
	flows forward through a hole in the center of the iris, called the pupil, and down into the angle defined by the front of the iris and the back of the cornea, which is the clear covering on the front of the eye. This angle is the same angle referred
	to in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma, or POAG, the most common form of glaucoma. Below is a diagram depicting certain parts of the eye, including the ciliary body, iris and the angle defined by the front of the iris and the back of the cornea:

	In this angle, in front of the outer rim of the iris, is the TM, a natural, pressure-regulating
	drain. It is here that in a healthy, well-functioning eye, approximately 70% of the aqueous humor exits and flows into a drainage canal known as Schlemm&#146;s canal, which empties back into the venous drainage system. The remaining approximately
	30% of the aqueous humor leaves the eye through a secondary pathway called the uveoscleral pathway. The diagram below reflects the TM and the uveoscleral pathway, the two pathways for the aqueous humor to leave the eye.

	In a typical glaucoma patient, there is resistance to drainage of the aqueous fluid (i.e., not enough aqueous humor exits the eye), creating
	excess pressure and compressing the retina, the layer of tissue covering the inside of the back half of the eye that actually converts light into nerve impulses. For people to &#147;see,&#148; these impulses&#151;the visual signal&#151;must be
	relayed through the optic nerve back to the brain for processing. The cells in the retina require nutrients and oxygen that are delivered via blood vessels entering and exiting the eye through the same opening as the nerve fibers carrying the visual
	signal. However, when IOP is too high, it is more difficult to pump blood enriched in oxygen and nutrients into the retina. The diagram below reflects the anatomy of the eye and how elevated IOP can impair the nerve tissue in the retina and the
	optic nerve head.

	The deprivation of blood supply to the retina may damage RGCs, the nerve tissue in the retina that relays
	the visual signal to the brain. These RGCs have long tails called axons that extend back to the brain to carry the visual image. In fact, the optic nerve is nothing more than a bundle of these axons extending to the vision processing center of the
	brain. When an RGC dies, one of the connections between the retina and the brain is lost, and like most cases when a nerve is damaged or cut&#151;like in a spinal cord injury&#151;there is no known way to repair the damage and, as a result, some
	portion of vision is permanently lost. Therefore, the root cause of vision loss in glaucoma is not high IOP per se, but the impact of high IOP on the retina, and specifically the RGCs.

	There are two key elements to the clinical definition of glaucoma: structural evidence of optic nerve damage and vision loss. Common risk
	factors include age, family history, corneal thickness and high IOP, commonly measured in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. Currently, the only known way to treat glaucoma and slow the progression of vision loss is to reduce IOP. While treatment
	approaches are based on an assessment of the patient&#146;s risk factors for vision loss, elevated IOP is by far the best understood contributor to development of glaucoma. We believe that the general treatment patterns in the figure below, relative
	to a patient&#146;s IOP, are typical.

	The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study, or the OHTS, was a large, randomized academic trial published in
	2002 that followed a total of 1,636 participants who initially had no evidence of glaucoma-related damage. The OHTS found that higher IOPs generally indicate a higher risk for progression to glaucoma. An IOP of 10 to 21 mmHg is generally considered
	in the normal range. Individuals with IOPs greater than 21 and up to 25 mmHg will often not be prescribed drug therapy unless they have evidence of both structural changes and some vision loss, or some combination of these and other risk factors for
	future vision loss. In fact, the United Kingdom&#146;s National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Guidelines, or NICE Guidelines, for the treatment of suspected glaucoma (structural changes but without vision loss) plus elevated IOP, does not
	recommend treatment of eyes with corneal thickness of 555-590 nm and IOP of 25 mmHg or below. Drug treatment is much more common when patients have IOPs greater than 25 mmHg.

	The initial treatment for glaucoma patients is typically the use of a prescription eye drop from a class of drugs called PGAs. According to IMS
	Health, prescriptions for PGAs make up more than half of all prescriptions for glaucoma medications. The PGAs&#146; primary mechanism of action for treating glaucoma is thought to be increasing fluid outflow through the uveoscleral pathway. A number
	of adverse effects are known to occur in all drugs in the PGA class and, as a result, these side effects are assumed to be associated with the mechanism of action. Most notable of these side effects is eye redness, or conjunctival hyperemia.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	When PGAs are insufficient to control IOP or are poorly tolerated, non-PGA products are used either as an add-on therapy to the PGA or as an
	alternative monotherapy in place of a PGA. Non-PGAs can include a beta-blocker, an alpha (adrenergic) agonist or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor alone.&nbsp;FDC products containing these non-PGAs are dominated by beta-blocker combinations, which can
	take the form of a beta-blocker combined with an alpha agonist (Combigan
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

	), or a beta-blocker combined with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
	(Cosopt
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;

	or generic equivalent).&nbsp;Finally, there is a non-PGA combination (Simbrinza
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	) which consist solely of an alpha agonist and
	a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Non-PGA drugs generally have poorer tolerability in the eye than PGA drugs, and some have systemic adverse effects that limit the patient population in which they can be used safely. Moreover, their IOP-lowering
	effect is generally less than that of PGAs and the vast majority of non-PGAs are required to be dosed multiple times daily.

	We believe there are currently two leading classes of new drugs in clinical development for glaucoma: Rho kinase inhibitors and adenosine
	mimetics.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A Rho kinase inhibitor is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials and is the furthest along of the potential new glaucoma drug
	therapies: Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#146;s AR-13324. Like with PGAs, conjunctival hyperemia has been reported with the Rho kinase inhibitor class.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Adenosine mimetics are compounds that mimic or simulate some of the actions or effects of adenosine, a naturally-occurring molecule with many,
	diverse biologic effects. There are four known subreceptors that are specific to adenosine: A1, A2a, A2b and A3. These subreceptors can cause many effects if stimulated. In the adenosine mimetic group, there are compounds targeting three different
	adenosine subreceptors: A1, A2a and A3. We believe that A1 selectivity is necessary for optimal IOP-lowering effect. To our knowledge, the two compounds being developed by other companies that were selective for the A2a subreceptor have been
	discontinued from clinical development for glaucoma. A third compound being developed that we believe targets both the A1 (IOP-lowering) and the A3 (IOP-increasing) subreceptors is still being studied. We believe that because this third compound is
	dosed orally, it is challenging to isolate its pharmacologic effects solely to the eye. We believe we are the only company to be developing an adenosine mimetic highly selective for the A1 subreceptor for ophthalmic indications.

	is a first-in-class selective adenosine mimetic that is designed to lower IOP with a mechanism of action that we believe

	We believe that

	&#146;s mechanism of action augments a naturally occurring process by clearing the path for aqueous humor outflow in the TM. We expect
	that this mechanism of action should complement all currently-approved glaucoma drugs which work in other ways to lower IOP, including by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing outflow through the uveoscleral pathway. This complementary
	mechanism was confirmed in patients already receiving
<I>
	latanoprost

	therapy in a recently completed multiple-dose Phase 2 trial. In this Phase 2 trial of
<I>

	Adenosine is a naturally occurring molecule that has a broad array of biological effects. Its effects are mediated through activity at four
	known adenosine-specific subreceptors: A1, A2a, A2b and A3. These subreceptors are present throughout the body on the cells of different tissues, and at different concentrations. When adenosine binds and activates these different subreceptors, it
	can cause many diverse effects.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 1995, a study was published in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics describing
	how adenosine mimetics can lower IOP by activating adenosine A1 subreceptors in rabbits. In 2001, an animal study published by the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine confirmed that stimulation of A1 lowered IOP, but that stimulating A2a
	or A3 subreceptors increased IOP.

	of a single adenosine subreceptor. In this way, the undesired biological actions of native adenosine were systematically removed, one by one by eliminating the activity at non-target

	Our first product candidate,
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	, is a monotherapy dosed in an eye drop. Our clinical trials have shown that
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	has significant IOP-lowering effects, convenient dosing and also has a favorable safety profile when compared to the currently available glaucoma treatments, such as PGAs and non-PGAs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As many as half of glaucoma patients, typically those with more severe disease, need to use two or more glaucoma drugs to sufficiently reduce
	their IOP. The available FDC products increase IOP-lowering but also have unpleasant tolerability challenges in the eye, as well as the adverse effects, safety warnings, precautions and contraindications that the two individually-dosed drugs carry
	in their FDA-approved package inserts. An FDC product containing a PGA plus a non-PGA has not yet been approved in the United States. We believe that none have gained FDA approval because the modest incremental benefit in IOP-lowering seen when a
	non-PGA is added to a PGA is too small in the context of the added side effects and clinical risks that come with the combined drugs. In contrast, based on our completed Phase 2 study in which
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	therapy was co-administered with
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	, we believe that an FDC containing a PGA and
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	would be well received in the glaucoma market, especially for use in patients with higher IOPs that currently use two or more glaucoma drugs to lower IOP.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our second product candidate is a combination of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	with a PGA,
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	, to create an FDC. While our FDC product
	candidate has not yet been formulated as an FDC or administered to humans, we expect that
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	will not adversely affect the safety profile of
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	, or any other currently-approved PGA, because of its favorable safety
	and tolerability profile from our completed Phase 2 trial in which
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	and
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	were co-administered. We believe that
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	&#146;s mechanism for lowering IOP complements the mechanism of action of
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	and other PGAs, which work primarily on the secondary uveoscleral outflow, because
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	is believed to act through the TM, the largest aqueous humor outflow path in the eye. In fact, our IOP-lowering studies in
	cynomolgus monkeys have shown that IOP-lowering is significantly better when the eye is treated with both
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	and
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	, as compared to treatment with
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	alone.

	Our completed Phase 2 trial of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	co-administered with
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	also
	demonstrated IOP-lowering in patients who have previously had inadequate responses to
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	. These patients represent PGA poor-responders, as evidenced by persistently elevated IOP at levels that typically require the addition of a
	second drug to further lower IOP. The safety profile of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	co-administered with
<I>

	is similar to that of

	could protect this key population of cells in the retina that, when lost,
	result in the irreversible vision loss associated with glaucoma. While we have not yet conducted a formal program of studies to prove neuroprotection, we plan to study the potential of
<I>

	monotherapy and our FDC product candidate to
	slow the loss of vision significantly more than attributable to IOP lowering alone, either in glaucoma patients or in other rarer forms of optic neuropathies.

	Our Phase 3 program for

</I>
	as a monotherapy will incorporate the FDA-acceptable clinical endpoint of IOP, in studies with
	three months of treatment. We had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in 2015 to discuss our Phase 3 program for
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	monotherapy, and to confirm the design and endpoints for the Phase 3 pivotal trials. At the meeting, we reached
	agreement on the design for our initial Phase 3 study, as well as the overall regulatory path for
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	. The trial design for the initial Phase 3 study is a five-arm superiority trial that will include three doses of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	. The primary endpoint of the study is IOP, determined at four timepoints during the day, after 4, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. The IOP of the
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	treated subjects will be statistically compared to those of placebo
	treated subjects. A timolol arm will be included for study validation, but not for statistical comparison.

	monotherapy in October 2015 and we expect to report top-line data from the first pivotal trial in the program by late 2016. If the primary objectives of all of the trials in our Phase 3 program are met, we plan to

	In 2012, we completed a successful Phase 2 dose-ranging clinical trial in 144 patients with OHT (ocular hypertension with no visual field loss)
	or POAG, which demonstrated a clear dose response to
<I>

	. Statistically significant results for the primary endpoint of our Phase 2 clinical trials indicate that
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	has IOP-lowering effects in line with the best
	existing therapies, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile at all doses tested. The trial was randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, and evaluated the efficacy, tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	over
	two or four weeks of BID dosing with eye drops. Separate groups of patients received
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	doses of 50, 100 or 200 mcg for two weeks, or 500 mcg for four weeks, and their IOP-lowering efficacy and safety data were compared to groups of
	patients dosed concurrently with placebo eye drops, also BID. To enter the trial, otherwise healthy patients had to have elevated IOPs (greater than or equal to 24 mmHg and less than or equal to 34 mmHg) when off of all glaucoma drugs, and a
	diagnosis of either OHT or POAG.

	The primary efficacy endpoint was IOP (measured throughout the day). The primary efficacy

	When we rationally designed
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	, our primary objective was to restore pressure regulation
	in eyes with high IOP, a risk factor for glaucoma. A healthy eye has a natural circadian rhythm that dictates a pattern of IOP over the day. We found that this pattern, or the shape of the IOP circadian rhythm curve throughout the day, is relatively
	unchanged by
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	treatment, except that the overall IOP during the day is reduced by
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	treatment as intended. We believe this indicates that the TM has been restored to an improved function resulting in a more
	normal average pressure, and that this normal daily IOP pattern indicates that the fundamental biology of pressure management in the eye has been preserved. The natural daily changes in IOP still exist, but at a significantly lower average pressure
	that we believe is less damaging to RGCs and the optic nerve. The figure below shows the primary efficacy parameter for the trial, IOP, at several timepoints throughout the day (diurnal IOP) for the highest dose tested and the placebo group at day
	28.

	by persistently high IOP, despite

	to be evaluated. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, an initial IND, which contains the results of preclinical testing along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed
	protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and imposes a clinical
	hold. A clinical hold may also be imposed at any time while the IND is in effect. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may

	In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data
	establishing to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application
	includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s
	chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources,
	including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.

	During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given
	opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the End-of-Phase 1 or 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity
	for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End-of-Phase 2 meetings to discuss
	their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.

	The results of product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with
	descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The FDA
	reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept a NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted
	with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be
	accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other
	things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has
	agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs in 12 months from submission of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted
	information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a
	complete response letter to communicate that the NDA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, non-clinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application
	can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. If or when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA,
	the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information included. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present
	difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what
	conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

	Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the
	product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA,
	the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will
	request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by
	the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy
	the regulatory criteria for approval.

	The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is
	approved. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In
	addition, the FDA has authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency. See &#147;Post-Marketing Requirements&#148; below.

	The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or a REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of
	a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include &#147;Dear
	Doctor letters,&#148; a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or

	Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a

	one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted
	with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be

	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain competing applications. The FDCA provides
	a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug
	containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA
	submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a
	certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if
	new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an
	existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year
	exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical
	trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

	In the United States, once a product is approved, its

	area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using
	contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject

	Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement
	from third-party payors, including government healthcare program administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers, and other entities. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and
	their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all of part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to
	cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, our products, once approved, may not obtain market acceptance unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process
	for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also
	known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved.
	Moreover, a third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels
	sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor&#146;s decision to cover a
	particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will
	require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.

	The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus
	in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drug products and medical services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to
	questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be
	sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.

	by a pharmacy and therapeutics committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a
	Part D prescription drug plan will likely be discounted, thereby lowering the net price realized on our sales to pharmacies. Moreover, while the Part D program applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow
	Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-government payors.

	The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different

	of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the
	research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a
	competitor&#146;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates, once approved. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after

	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements
	governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement
	and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the
	medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.

	The
	Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, solicit, receive, offer, or
	pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be
	made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply
	to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from
	prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an
	exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the
	arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable
	Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order
	to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False
	Claims Act. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws
	similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the
	breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future business activities, including our sales and marketing practices and/or our future
	relationships with ophthalmologists and optometrists might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us.

	Federal false
	claims and false statement laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid)
	claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. This statute has been interpreted to prohibit presenting claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.
	Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#147;cause&#148; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding
	information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information
	and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the
	Federal civil False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a civil False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between
	$5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may

	requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of individuals and organizations. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#146;s privacy and security standards directly
	applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity.
	HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#146; fees and

	at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to
	providers up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act
	of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments
	to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.

	auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or
	which are in the interest of public health in the EU. The National MAA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this
	National MAA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MAA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member
	States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MAA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the
	Reference Member State, or RMS. If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States do not raise objections, the product is granted a national MAA in all the Member States where the authorization was sought. Before granting the
	MAA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

	Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront expenditures and significant
	risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our non-clinical development activities and clinical trials. We
	are not currently generating revenues, and we cannot estimate with precision the extent of our future losses. We do not currently have any products that are available for commercial sale and we may never generate revenue from selling products or
	achieve profitability. We expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing losses through the projected commercialization of our product candidates. None of our product candidates have been approved for marketing in the United States and may
	never receive such approval. As a result of these factors, we are uncertain when or if we will achieve profitability and, if so, whether we will be able to sustain it. Our ability to produce revenue and achieve profitability is dependent on our
	ability to complete the development of our product candidates, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, and have our products manufactured and successfully marketed. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable even if we successfully commercialize
	our products. Failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.

	C preferred stock. In June 2011, we completed the sale of an aggregate of approximately $23.5 million of Series AA preferred stock in four separate closings during the preceding year. In February 2013, we completed the sale of approximately $3.5
	million of convertible promissory notes in three separate closings during the preceding eight months. In July 2013, we completed the sale of an additional approximately $13.5 million of Series AA preferred stock, including the conversion of the

	Regulatory authorities outside of the United States, such as in Europe and Japan and in emerging markets, also have requirements for approval

	product candidates, certain changes to the product, such as changes in manufacturing processes and additional labeling claims, will be subject to additional FDA review and approval. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be

	A failure of one or more clinical
	trials can occur at any stage of testing for a variety of reasons. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily
	predict final results. In addition, adverse events may occur or other risks may be discovered in any clinical trials that will cause us to suspend or terminate our clinical trials. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety
	and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including but not limited to changes in or adherence to trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations and the rates of
	dropout among clinical trial participants. Prior to initiation of our Phase 3 monotherapy clinical trial in October 2015, we had exposed 233 clinical trial subjects to
<I>
	trabodenoson

	. The FDA expects that a total of at least 1,300 patients will
	be exposed to at least a single dose of
<I>
	trabodenoson

	before submission of an NDA, and the complete NDA submission package must also contain safety data from at least 300 patients treated with
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	for at least six months, and
	at least 100 patients treated for at least a year. Our future clinical trial results therefore may not demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. Moreover, we still need to evaluate the
	long-term safety effects of our product candidates, the results of which could adversely affect our clinical development program.

	Flaws
	in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well-advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval. In
	addition, clinical trials often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. Further, we have never submitted an NDA for any product candidates.

	We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants.
	Further, regulatory agencies and IRBs may at any time order or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend to the sponsor the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in
	the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants.

	If the results of our clinical trials for our current product candidates or clinical trials for any future product candidates do not achieve
	the primary efficacy endpoints or demonstrate unexpected safety issues, the prospects for approval of our product candidates will be materially adversely affected. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying
	interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have failed to achieve similar results in later clinical trials, including longer term
	trials, or have failed to obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical trials or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected adverse effects that

	Third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare
	insurers, carefully review and increasingly question and challenge the coverage of and the prices charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors.
	Reimbursement rates may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. A current trend in the U.S. healthcare industry is toward cost containment. Large public and
	private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and other similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party
	payors, including Medicare, may question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. In particular,
	third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for our product candidates, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. We believe our drugs will be
	priced significantly higher than existing generic drugs and consistently with current branded drugs. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party
	payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. If
	we are unable to show a significant benefit relative to existing generic drugs, Medicare, Medicaid and private payors may not be willing to cover or provide adequate reimbursement for our drugs, which would significantly reduce the likelihood of
	them gaining market acceptance. In the United States, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly
	from payor to payor.

	that is intended to induce or reward the referral of business, including the purchase, lease, order or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In March 2010,
	President Obama signed into law the ACA, a sweeping law intended to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new
	transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other changes that affect the pharmaceutical industry, the ACA increased
	manufacturers&#146; rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate amount for both branded and generic drugs and revised the definition of average manufacturer price, or AMP, which may also increase the
	amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also expanded Medicaid drug rebates, which previously had been payable only on fee-for-service utilization, to Medicaid managed care utilization, and
	created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the rebates due on those drugs. Further, the ACA imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import
	branded prescription drug products and requires manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale discount off the negotiated price of applicable branded drugs dispensed to beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the &#147;donut
	hole.&#148; Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, as described above. Although it is too early to determine the full effect of the ACA, the new law appears likely to
	continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.

	Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control
	Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021,
	was unable to reach the required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into
	effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced
	Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any
	reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.

	changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to
	more stringent product labeling and post-marketing approval testing and other requirements.

	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights
	to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly

	jurisdictions, it may be difficult for us to prevent infringement of our patents or misappropriation of these intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant

	Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization
	and may sue us for patent or other intellectual property infringement. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. If we are sued for patent
	infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, potential products or methods either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this.
	Proving invalidity or unenforceability is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are
	successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we
	may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. If a court holds that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and cover our products or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block
	our ability to commercialize our products unless we acquire or obtain a license under the applicable patents or until the patents expire. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on
	reasonable terms. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our products or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of products by us. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it
	may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or
	litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates
	or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our
	business. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.

	not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, patent litigation may result. We might decide to initiate litigation in an

	lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be
	disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.

	We may be required to initiate

	In any infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the
	substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we
	will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are resolved. Further, any claims we assert against a perceived infringer could provoke these parties to assert
	counterclaims against us alleging that we have infringed their patents. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources.
	Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.

	Any name we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 we had federal and state net operating losses of approximately $88&nbsp;million and $47
	million, respectively, which may be utilized against future federal and state income taxes, respectively. In general, a corporation that undergoes an &#147;ownership change&#148; is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net
	operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by
	more than fifty percentage points over such stockholders&#146; lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Purchases of our common stock in amounts greater than specified levels, which are beyond our control, or
	prior issuances of our common stock, could create a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than
	would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs
	before they expire. If any of these events occur, or have occurred in the past, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs. We have determined that we have experienced prior ownership changes occurring in 2005, 2007, and
	2015. NOLs generated prior to these changes, although subject to an annual limitation, can be utilized in future years as well as any post change NOLs. In addition, at the state level there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or
	otherwise limited, which would accelerate or may permanently increase state taxes owed.

	Although we are still evaluating the JOBS Act, we currently intend to take advantage of some,
	but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us so long as we qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company.&#148; For example, we have irrevocably elected under Section&nbsp;107 of the JOBS Act not to
	take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section&nbsp;102(b) of the JOBS Act. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an
	attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over
	financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding
	compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. We cannot predict if
	investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price
	may be more volatile and may decline.

	and approximately $18.9 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering-related costs, from our debt issuances. In July&nbsp;and August 2015, holders of $21,000&nbsp;principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes elected
	to convert the principal into 3,333,319&nbsp;shares of common stock. In addition, the Interest Make-Whole Payment (as defined in the notes to the consolidated financial statements) was settled with shares of common stock, at the election of the
	Company, resulting in the issuance of 530,072 additional shares of common stock. There has been no material change in the use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule
	424(b).

	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for glaucoma.
	Glaucoma is a disease of the eye that is typically characterized by structural evidence of optic nerve damage, vision loss and consistently elevated intraocular pressure (&#147;IOP&#148;). Our lead product candidate,
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	, is a
	first-in-class selective adenosine mimetic that we rationally designed to lower IOP by restoring the eye&#146;s natural pressure control mechanism. Our product pipeline includes
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	monotherapy delivered in an eye drop formulation,
	as well as a fixed-dose combination (&#147;FDC&#148;)

	trabodenoson
</I>
	with
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	, a prostaglandin analogue (&#147;PGA&#148;), given once-daily. Our completed Phase 2 trial of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	co-administered with
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	demonstrated IOP-lowering in patients who have previously had inadequate response to
<I>
	latanoprost
</I>
	. These patients represent PGA poor-responders, as evidenced by persistently elevated IOP at levels that typically require the
	addition of a second drug to further lower IOP.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
	(&#147;FDA&#148;) in the first half of 2015 to discuss our Phase 3 program for
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	monotherapy and to confirm the design and endpoints for the Phase 3 pivotal trials. Our End-of-Phase 2 meeting was a critical milestone for advancing
	the development of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	. At the meeting, we reached agreement on the design of our initial Phase 3 trial, as well as the overall regulatory path for
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	. For our first Phase 3 trial, we agreed to three doses of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	, 1000 mcg once daily, 1500 mcg twice daily, and 2000 mcg once daily, to be tested against placebo as the primary comparator for statistical purposes. Dosing of patients in this trial for
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	monotherapy commenced
	in October 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2015, we completed our initial public offering (the &#147;IPO&#148;) of (i)&nbsp;6,667,000 shares of common
	stock at a price of $6.00 per share and (ii)&nbsp;$20.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the &#147;2020 Convertible Notes&#148;). In March 2015 the underwriters purchased 299,333 shares of common stock at
	$6.00 per share and $1.0 million of the 2020 Convertible Notes pursuant to exercises of their overallotment options. We received net proceeds of $36.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering-related costs, from our equity
	issuances and $18.9&nbsp;million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering-related costs, from our debt issuances (See Note 5 in the accompanying notes to the financial statements). Prior to this we funded our operations
	primarily through the sale of preferred stock and issuance of convertible promissory notes and notes payable. In connection with the IPO, all of our outstanding 25,949,333 shares of Series AA and Series X preferred stock, including all accrued and
	unpaid dividends thereon, automatically converted into 8,002,650 shares of common stock.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In July and August 2015, the $21.0 million
	principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes fully converted into 3,863,391 shares of common stock (see Note 5 in the accompanying notes to the financial statements).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In August 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock (the &#147;Follow-on Offering&#148;). We issued 6,210,000
	shares of common stock at a price of $12.75 per share, including 810,000 shares from the underwriters&#146; full exercise of their overallotment option, and received net proceeds of $74.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
	offering-related costs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $196.0 million and cash and cash equivalents and
	short-term investments aggregating $111.3 million. We estimate we have sufficient funding to sustain operations through 2017. See &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since our inception on July&nbsp;7, 1999, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to business planning, raising capital, product
	research and development, applying for and obtaining government and private grants, recruiting management, research and technical staff and other personnel, acquiring operating assets, and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our
	lead product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have not completed development of any product candidate and we have therefore not generated any revenues from
	product sales. Prior to 2012, we generated revenues primarily from research grants received from governmental agencies and private companies as well as revenue earned under licensing and research collaboration contracts. All previously recognized
	revenue was unrelated to our current development efforts focused on our lead product candidate,
<I>
	trabodenoson,

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to invest in research
	and development and continue our Phase 3 program of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	, which we commenced in October 2015. We also expect our expenses to increase as we complete formulation and manufacturing activities of our FDC product candidate which is
	expected to commence clinical trials in 2016. In addition, if we successfully launch
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	as a monotherapy or any other product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing,
	manufacturing and distribution of our products.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public
	company. Operating expenses have increased substantially to support our increased infrastructure and expanded operations. Accordingly, we will need to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Adequate additional
	financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any potential future
	commercialization efforts. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never do so. As a result, we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future.

	We have not generated any revenue from product sales since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale
	of products in the near future. Our ability to generate revenues will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of
<I>
	trabodenoson
</I>
	and any other future product candidates. Historically, we generated revenues
	primarily from research grants received from governmental agencies and private companies as well as revenue earned under licensing and research collaboration contracts that were unrelated to our current research and development programs.

	note to each lender and received net proceeds of $6.9 million. The notes bore interest at a rate of 11.0%&nbsp;per annum and had a maturity date of October&nbsp;1, 2016. In February 2015, we paid the lenders with proceeds from our IPO, a total of
	$5.7 million, which included $5.3 million for the remaining principal and $0.4 million for end of term and prepayment amounts and accrued interest. These notes payable agreements were then terminated. The following table summarizes our sources and

	We base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with
	multiple CROs that conduct and manage non-clinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be
	instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and
	the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and level of effort to be expended in each period. If the
	actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our
	understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting expenses that are too high or too low in any particular period.

	markets without any valuation adjustments. We have determined that our certificates of deposit are categorized as Level 2 assets under the fair value hierarchy, as there are no quoted market prices in active markets, and our agency bonds as Level 2
	assets under the fair value hierarchy, as these assets are not always valued daily using quoted market prices in active markets. Our material financial instruments at December&nbsp;31, 2014, consisted of preferred stock warrant liabilities and a

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Convertible Bridge Notes redemption rights derivative required separate accounting and was valued using a single income valuation approach. We estimated
	the fair value of the redemption rights derivative using a &#145;&#145;with and without&#146;&#146; income valuation approach. Under this approach, we estimated the present value of the fixed interest rate debt based on the fair value of similar
	debt instruments excluding the embedded feature. This amount was then compared to the fair value of the debt instrument including the embedded feature using a probability weighted approach by assigning each embedded derivative feature a probability
	of occurrence, with consideration provided for the settlement amount including conversion discounts, prepayment penalties, the expected life of the liability and the applicable discount rate.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of the issuance of the Convertible Bridge Notes on December&nbsp;22, 2014 and on December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company ascribed a probability of occurrence
	of 25% to the change in control redemption feature of the Convertible Bridge Notes. The expected life of the feature was the remaining term of the debt and the discount rate was 18.9%. The Company classified the liability within Level 3 of the fair
	value hierarchy as the probability factor and the discount rate are unobservable inputs and significant to the valuation model.

	Based on the characteristics of the (i)&nbsp;conversion option including make-whole provision,
	(ii)&nbsp;the Additional Interest, and (iii)&nbsp;the notes, we estimated the fair value of the conversion option including make-whole and the Additional Interest using the &#147;with&#148; and &#147;without&#148; method. Using this methodology, we
	first valued the notes with the conversion option including make-whole provision but excluding the Additional Interest (the &#147;with&#148; scenario) and subsequently valued the notes without the conversion option including make-whole provision and
	excluding the Additional Interest (the &#147;without&#148; scenario). The difference between the fair values of the notes in the &#147;with&#148; and &#147;without&#148; scenarios was the concluded fair value of the conversion option including
	make-whole provision as of the measurement date. We developed an estimate of fair value for the notes excluding the Additional Interest using a binomial lattice model. We modeled the decision to convert or hold by considering the maximum of the
	conversion or hold value at every node of the lattice in which the notes are convertible and choosing the action that maximizes the return to the notes&#146; holders. The significant assumptions used in the binomial model were: the market yield and
	the expected volatility.

	We estimated the fair value of the Additional Interest using an income approach, specifically, the risk-neutral
	debt valuation method that is used to derive the value of a debt instrument using the expected cash flows and the risk-free rate. The significant assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows were the market yield used to determine the
	risk-neutral probability of default and the expected recovery rate upon default.

	purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the first and last day of the offering with aggregate withholdings as of the end of the offering. The offerings commence on June&nbsp;1 and December&nbsp;1
	and are six months in duration. A participant may reduce his or her withholdings as many times as he or she wishes and may increase his or her withholdings two times during an offering. The Company&#146;s Board of Directors has authorized the
	issuance of a number of shares of common stock issuable under the ESPP to the number that represents 1% of the Company&#146;s outstanding common stock outstanding immediately after the IPO, or 160,276 shares. The ESPP provides that the number of
	shares reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP shall be cumulatively increased each January&nbsp;1, beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2016, by the lesser of (i)&nbsp;600,000&nbsp;shares of common stock or (ii)&nbsp;the number of shares
	necessary to set the number of shares of Common Stock under the Plan at 1% percent of the outstanding number of shares as of January&nbsp;1 of the applicable year. However, the Board of Directors reserves the right to determine that there will be no
	increase for any year or that any increase will be for a lesser number of shares. On January&nbsp;1, 2016, the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP was increased by 97,000 to 244,133 shares. As of December&nbsp;31,
	2015, 13,143 shares of common stock were purchased by plan participants and issued by the Company pursuant to the ESPP at a purchase price of $4.83 per share. Dr.&nbsp;Baumgartner, Dr.&nbsp;McVicar and Mr.&nbsp;Ritter each purchased 4,143 shares,

	In December 2014, we sold subordinated convertible promissory notes, or the 2014 bridge notes, in the aggregate original principal amount of
	$2.0 million to existing stockholders. As consideration for our issuance of the 2014 bridge notes, each investor paid us an amount equal to the original principal amount of the note issued to the investor. The 2014 bridge notes mature on
	June&nbsp;30, 2015, accrue interest at the rate of 8%&nbsp;per annum and are subordinate to all other senior indebtedness of the Company. As of the date of this prospectus, the aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest under the 2014
	bridge notes is approximately $2.0&nbsp;million. Upon the closing of our initial public offering, all outstanding principal and accrued interest of the 2014 bridge notes, automatically converted into common stock at the initial public offering
	price. The following table summarizes the participation in the 2014 bridge notes financing by any of our directors, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of our voting securities, or any member of the immediate family of the foregoing persons.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corporation as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and
	the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders&#146; equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
	over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
	Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corporation as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	Pharmaceuticals Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing molecules with novel mechanisms of action to address significant diseases of the eye. The Company&#146;s business strategy is to develop
	and progress its product candidates through human clinical trials. The Company&#146;s headquarters are located in Lexington, Massachusetts.

	The Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to research and development, including clinical trials of its product candidates. The
	Company has not completed the development of any product candidates. The Company has no current source of revenue to sustain present activities and does not expect to generate revenue until and unless the Company receives regulatory approval of and
	successfully commercializes its product candidates. The Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties similar to those of other life science companies developing new products, including, among others, the risks related to the necessity
	to obtain adequate additional financing, to successfully develop product candidates, to obtain regulatory approval of products candidates, to comply with government regulations, to successfully commercialize its potential products, to the protection
	of proprietary technology and to the dependence on key individuals.

	In February 2015, the Company completed its initial public offering

	and their affiliated entities purchased approximately 3,005,000 shares of common stock issued in the IPO at the same terms previously described. In March 2015 the underwriters purchased 299,333 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share and $1,000 of
	the 2020 Convertible Notes pursuant to exercises of their overallotment options. The Company received net proceeds of $36,495, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering-related costs, from its equity issuances and $18,903 in net proceeds,
	after deducting underwriting discounts and offering-related costs, from its debt issuances (See Note 7).

	The Company will need to expend substantial resources for research and development, including costs associated with the clinical testing of
	its product candidates and will need to obtain additional financing to fund its operations and to conduct trials for its product candidates. If such products were to receive regulatory approval, the Company would need to prepare for the potential
	commercialization of its product candidates and fund the commercial launch and continued marketing of its products. The Company expects operating expenses will substantially increase in the future related to additional clinical testing and to
	support an increased infrastructure to support expanded operations and being a public company

	The Company will require additional funding in the future and may not be able to raise such
	additional funds. The Company expects losses will continue as it conducts research and development activities. The Company will seek to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, license agreements, debt financings,
	collaborations, strategic alliances, or any combination thereof. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur
	additional debt, limitations on the Company&#146;s ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact the ability of the Company to conduct its business. If adequate funds
	are not available, the Company would delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs and reduce administrative expenses. The Company may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if it
	does not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. In addition, if the Company raises additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, it may have to relinquish valuable
	rights to its technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to it. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient funding, it may be unable to continue to operate. There is no
	assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on acceptable terms and conditions to fund continuing operations, if at all. The failure of the Company to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could
	have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business, results of operations and financial condition.

	Basis of Presentation
</B>
	&#151;The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Inotek Securities Corporation. All significant

	Segment Reporting
</B>
	&#151;Operating segments are
	defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The
	Company views its operations and manages its business in one operating segment.

<B>
	Use of Estimates
</B>
	&#151;The preparation of financial
	statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
	reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the valuation of stock options used for the calculation of stock-based
	compensation, fair value of warrant liabilities and other derivative instruments, and determination of accruals related to research and clinical development.

	Cash and Cash Equivalents

	&#151;Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, certificates of deposit and money market accounts.

	The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. The
	Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalent accounts and certificates of deposit, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant

	Stock-Based Compensation

	&#151;The Company measures the cost of

	service in exchange for the award. The fair value of options on the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on key assumptions such as stock price, expected volatility and expected term. The Company&#146;s
	estimates of these assumptions are primarily based on historical data, peer company data and judgment regarding future trends and factors. Compensation cost for stock purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plan is measured and recognized
	on the date the Company becomes obligated to issue shares of our common stock and is based on the difference between the fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock and the purchase price on such date.

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value of
	the investments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable

	instrument&#146;s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value of the Company&#146;s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents,
	prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their respective carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company&#146;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a

	Income taxes

	&#151;The Company uses the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method,
	deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases.
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded if it is more
	likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.

	The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more
	likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent
	likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.

	. Basic earnings (loss) per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) is calculated by dividing the net income or loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration of
	unissued common stock equivalents. The net loss applicable to common stockholders is determined by the reported net loss for the period and deducting dividends accrued and accretion of preferred stock. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the
	weighted average common shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of common stock options, warrants, and convertible preferred stock and accrued but unpaid convertible preferred stock dividends. In periods where a net loss is recorded, no effect is
	given to potentially dilutive securities, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.

	On February&nbsp;23, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of $20,000 of the 2020 Convertible Notes pursuant to its IPO. On March&nbsp;24,
	2015, the Company issued an additional $1,000 of 2020 Convertible Notes pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters&#146; overallotment option. The 2020 Convertible Notes had a maturity date of February&nbsp;15, 2020 (&#147;Maturity Date&#148;),
	were unsecured and accrued interest at a rate of 5.0%&nbsp;per annum, payable semi-annually on February&nbsp;15 and August&nbsp;15 of each year. In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, the Company incurred $2,097 of financing
	costs which were recorded in other assets on the balance sheet.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Each holder of a 2020 Convertible Note (the &#147;Holder&#148;), had the
	option to convert all or any portion of such note at an initial conversion rate of 158.7302 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock per $1 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes (the &#147;Conversion Rate&#148;). The Conversion Rate was
	subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including the issuance of stock dividends and payment of cash dividends. For any conversion that occurred on or after July&nbsp;23, 2015, the Company would, in addition
	to the other consideration payable, make an interest make-whole payment (the &#147;Interest Make-Whole Payment&#148;) to such converting Holder equal to the sum of the present values of the scheduled payments of interest that would have been made on
	the 2020 Convertible Notes to be converted had such notes remained outstanding from the date of the conversion (the &#147;Conversion Date&#148;) through the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the date that is three years after the Conversion Date and (ii)&nbsp;the
	Maturity Date, if the 2020 Convertible Notes had not been so converted or otherwise repurchased. Present values for the Interest Make-Whole Payment would be calculated using a discount rate equal to 2%. The Company could satisfy its obligation to
	pay any Interest Make-Whole Payment, at its election, in cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The 2020 Convertible
	Notes were convertible, at the holder&#146;s option, upon a fundamental change (&#147;Fundamental Change&#148;), as defined in the Indenture (&#147;Indenture&#148;). If a holder elected to convert its notes upon a Fundamental Change, the Company
	would increase the Conversion Rate for the 2020 Convertible Notes so surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of common stock by which the Conversion Rate would have increased per $1 principal amount of notes for each stock price
	and make-whole Fundamental Change effective date as set forth in the Indenture. The additional shares ranged from 7.9364 to 0.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon a
	Fundamental Change, each Holder would have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such Holder&#146;s notes, or any portion thereof that is equal to $1 or an integral multiple of $1. The repurchase price of the 2020
	Convertible Notes would equal 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. However, if the repurchase occurred after a regular record date for an interest payment, but before the distribution date of that interest
	payment, the Holder receive the regular interest payment and the repurchase price would equal 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes to be repurchased.

	The 2020 Convertible Notes were redeemable at the holder&#146;s option upon an event of default
	(&#147;Event of Default&#148;). If an Event of Default (other than certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company) occurred and was continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the holders of at least 25% in
	principal amount of the outstanding notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, could declare 100% of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all of the 2020 Convertible Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon the
	occurrence of certain Events of Default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company, 100% of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all of the 2020 Convertible Notes would become due and payable
	automatically.

	The Indenture provided that, to the extent the Company elected and for up to 180 days, the sole remedy for an Event of
	Default relating to certain failures by the Company to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture, consisted exclusively of the right to receive additional interest (&#147;Additional Interest&#148;) on the 2020&nbsp;Convertible Notes.
	The Additional Interest consisted of interest at an additional rate of 0.25%&nbsp;per annum for the first 90 days after the Event of Default. For the 91st to 180th day after the Event of Default, the Additional Interest would consist of interest at
	an additional rate of 0.50%&nbsp;per annum. After 180 days, if the Event of Default was not cured or waived, the 2020 Convertible Notes were subject to acceleration as provided in Section&nbsp;6.02 of the Indenture.

	The Company determined that the conversion option, Interest Make-Whole Payments and the Additional Interest were embedded derivatives that
	required bifurcation and separate accounting under ASC 815, Derivatives
<I>
	and Hedging
</I>
	. Based on the characteristics of the (i)&nbsp;conversion option including make-whole provision, (ii)&nbsp;the Additional Interest, and (iii)&nbsp;the 2020
	Convertible Notes, the Company estimated the fair value of the conversion option including the Interest Make-Whole provision and the Additional Interest using the &#147;with&#148; and &#147;without&#148; method. Using this methodology, the Company
	first valued the 2020 Convertible Notes with the conversion option including make-whole provision but excluding the Additional Interest (the &#147;with&#148; scenario) and subsequently valued the 2020 Convertible Notes without the conversion option
	including make-whole provision and excluding the Additional Interest (the &#147;without&#148; scenario). The difference between the fair values of the 2020 Convertible Notes in the &#147;with&#148; and &#147;without&#148; scenarios was the concluded
	fair value of the conversion option including make-whole provision as of the measurement date. The Company developed an estimate of fair value for the 2020 Convertible Notes excluding the Additional Interest using a binomial lattice model. The
	Company modeled the decision to convert or hold by considering the maximum of the conversion or hold value at every node of the lattice in which the 2020 Convertible Notes were convertible and choosing the action that would maximize the return to
	the 2020 Convertible Notes&#146; holders. The significant assumptions used in the binomial model were: the market yield and the expected volatility.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company estimated the fair value of the Additional Interest using an income approach, specifically, the risk-neutral debt valuation method
	that is used to derive the value of a debt instrument using the expected cash flows and the risk-free rate. The significant assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows were: the market yield used to determine the risk-neutral probability
	of default and the expected recovery rate upon default.

	The Company recorded $11,850 as the fair value of the combined embedded

	In December 2014, the Company sold an aggregate of $2,000 of subordinated convertible promissory notes to existing stockholders (the &#147;2014
	Convertible Bridge Notes&#148;). The 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes were to mature on June&nbsp;30, 2015 and accrued interest at the rate of 8%&nbsp;per annum and were subordinate to all other senior indebtedness of the Company. Upon the closing of
	an IPO of common stock of at least $40,000 in gross proceeds (&#147;a qualifying public offering&#148;), all outstanding principal and accrued interest thereon would automatically convert into common stock at the IPO price. In addition, the 2014
	Convertible Bridge Notes had the following features: (i)&nbsp;in the event the Company sold new notes prior to a qualifying public offering, the noteholders would convert the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes into the new notes; (ii)&nbsp;if at any time
	prior to repayment of the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes or a qualifying public offering the Company had a change in control transaction, the noteholders would receive either (a)&nbsp;cash in the amount of twice the principal and interest due as of
	the effective date of the change in control transaction or (b)&nbsp;shares of Series AA preferred stock based upon the conversion of the principal and interest due as of the effective date of the change in control transaction, whichever yields the
	greatest return (the &#145;Change in Control Redemption Feature&#148;); (iii)&nbsp;at any time after maturity, the noteholders could elect to convert all principal and accrued interest into Series&nbsp;AA Preferred stock at the current Series AA
	preferred stock conversion price; (v)&nbsp;the maturity date of the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes could be extended two times for additional six-month periods; (vi)&nbsp;upon an event of default, as defined in the notes, the noteholders could
	declare the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes immediately payable; and (vii)&nbsp;the Company would not prepay the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes without the consent of noteholders owning at least two thirds of the outstanding principal. Interest accrued
	on the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes was $4 at December&nbsp;31, 2014 and was reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company determined that the automatic conversion into common stock upon an IPO was the predominant feature of the 2014 Convertible Bridge
	Notes. Based on this the Company deemed the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes to be share-settled debt and accreted the debt discounts recorded (see below) to the redemption value over the term of the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes. The Company evaluated
	the various features of the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes and determined that the Change in Control Redemption Feature met the definition of a derivative and required bifurcation from the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes. At the issuance of the 2014
	Convertible Bridge Notes, the Company valued this derivative at $478&nbsp;and allocated that value from the proceeds of the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes and recorded a convertible notes redemption rights derivative liability on the balance sheet.
	The Company marked this liability to market at each reporting date and reflected the change in fair value in change in fair value of Convertible Bridge Notes redemption rights derivative in the statement of operations. In addition, the Company
	incurred $30 of costs associated with the issuance of the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes and recorded this amount as deferred financing costs which were reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The Company amortized (i)&nbsp;the debt
	discount recorded from the allocation of value to the redemption rights derivative and (ii)&nbsp;deferred financing costs, into interest expense using the effective interest method. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company reflected
	as interest expense related to the 2014 Convertible Bridge Notes (i)&nbsp;$4 related to the 8% coupon rate and (ii)&nbsp;$20 of amortization of the initial redemption rights derivative liability and issuance costs. In addition, the Company reflected
	a $2 increase in fair value of the derivative liability at December&nbsp;31, 2014 as loss on change in fair value of convertible notes redemption rights derivative. At December&nbsp;31, 2014, the principal balance of the 2014 Convertible Bridge
	Notes was $2,000.

	On June&nbsp;28, 2013, the Company entered into two Loan and Security Agreements (the &#147;Loan Agreements&#148; or &#147;Loans&#148;) with
	two financial entities (the &#147;Lenders&#148;) pursuant to which the Company issued Loans for $3,500 to each lender and received proceeds of $6,915 net of costs and fees payable to the lenders. The Loans were to bear interest at a rate per annum
	of 11.0%. The Loans were to mature on October&nbsp;1, 2016 and required interest-only payments for the initial 12 months and thereafter required repayment of the principal balance with interest in 27&nbsp;monthly installments. Also, upon full
	repayment or maturity of the Loans, the Lenders were due a termination payment of 3.0% of the initial principal amount of the Loans, or $210 (the &#147;Loan Termination Payment&#148;). In connection with the Loan Agreements, the Company granted
	first priority liens and the Loans were collateralized by the Company&#146;s personal property, including cash and cash equivalents. The Loan Agreements contained representations and warranties by the Company and certain indemnification provisions,
	non-financial covenants and default provisions. The Loan Agreements also included certain provisions allowing for prepayment of the debt by the Company, exercisable at the Company&#146;s option, which required payment of additional interest to the
	Lenders based upon a stated rate and the balance outstanding at repayment. The Company determined that the various embedded features did not require bifurcation from the Loan Agreements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the Loan Agreements, the Company issued to the Lenders fully-vested warrants to purchase either, at the election of the
	warrant holder, (i)&nbsp;228,906 shares of the Company&#146;s Series AA preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.529 per share, or (ii)&nbsp;$350 of stock in the next round stock, as defined in the Loan Agreements, at a price that was the lowest
	effective price per share that is offered in the next round. The warrants were to expire on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;ten years after the date of grant, or (ii)&nbsp;immediately prior to an acquisition transaction, as defined in the warrants.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company determined that the warrants should be classified as a liability based upon the nature of the underlying Series AA preferred
	stock. The Company recorded the fair value of the warrants of approximately $222 (Note 10) as a discount to the carrying value of the Loans and as a liability. The Company recognized any change in the value of the warrant liability each reporting
	period in the statement of operations. Additionally, the Company incurred fees related to the Loan Agreements and reimbursed Lenders for costs incurred by them aggregating $85 and reflected these fees as a discount to the carrying value of the Loan.
	The Company amortized these loan discounts and the Loan Termination Payment, together totaling $517, to interest expense over the term of the Loan using the effective interest rate method. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, interest expense
	related to the Loan Agreements was $956, including $218 related to accretion of the debt discount and termination payment. At December&nbsp;31, 2014, the principal balance on the Loan Agreements was $5,800, including the Loan Termination Payment and
	the unamortized debt discount and termination payment balance was $188. Principal payments on the Loans were $1,410 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	1.70% risk-free rate, and 60% volatility. The Company determined the fair value of the warrant liability at the IPO date to be $215 and recorded a gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $267 in the statement of operations for the
	year ended December 31, 2015. The Company determined that subsequent to this change, the warrants were exercisable at a fixed price for a fixed number of shares of common stock and qualified for equity classification under the accounting guidance,
	and the fair value of $215 was reclassified to additional paid-in capital as of the IPO date in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	allowance has been established against its net deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. The Company has offset certain deferred tax liabilities with deferred tax assets that are
	expected to generate offsetting deductions within the same period. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the valuation allowance changed by $6,313 and $2,643, respectively. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
	generation of future taxable income.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had federal NOL carryforwards for income tax purposes of
	$88,436 that expire at various dates through 2035, and state NOL carryforwards of $47,369 that expire at various dates through 2035, available to reduce future federal and state income taxes, if any. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had
	federal research and development tax credits of $3,196, and state research and development tax credits of $637. If substantial changes in the Company&#146;s ownership should occur, as defined in Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
	as amended, (the &#147;Code&#148;), there could be annual limitations on the amount of loss carryforwards which can be realized in future periods. The Company has determined that it has experienced prior ownership changes occurring in 2005, 2007 and
	2015. The pre-change NOLs, although subject to an annual limitation, can be utilized in future years as well as any post change NOLs, provided that sufficient income is generated and no future ownership changes occur that may limit the
	Company&#146;s NOLs.

	through 2015 remain open to examination by the tax jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax. Since the Company is in a loss carryforward position, the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) and state taxing authorities are permitted

	The Company has historically granted common stock options pursuant to the 2004 and 2014 Plans (as defined below) at an exercise price
	that is not less than the fair market value of the Company&#146;s stock as determined by the board of directors, with input from management. The board of directors has historically determined the estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s common
	stock on the date of grant based on a number of objective and subjective factors, including external market conditions, rights and preferences of securities senior to the common stock at the time of each grant, the likelihood of achieving a
	liquidity event such as an IPO or the sale of the Company, and third party valuations. For stock option grants prior to the IPO, the computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatilities of peer companies. The peer companies
	include organizations that are in the same industry, with similar size and stage of growth. The Company estimates that the expected life of the options granted using the simplified method allowable under Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107,
<I>
	Share Based Payments
</I>
	. The expected life is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as the Company does not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior among its employee population. The interest
	rate for grants pursuant to the 2004 and 2014 Plans are based on the U.S. treasury bills rate for U.S. treasury bills with terms commensurate with the expected term of the option grants on the grant date of the option.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November 2014 the Company&#146;s board of directors adopted and the stockholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
	(&#147;ESPP&#148;). The Company&#146;s board of directors has authorized the issuance of a number of shares of common stock issuable under the ESPP to the number that represents 1% of our outstanding common stock outstanding after the IPO, or
	160,276 shares. The ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP shall be cumulatively increased each January&nbsp;1, beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2016, by the lesser of (i)&nbsp;600,000&nbsp;shares of
	common stock or (ii)&nbsp;the number of shares necessary to set the number of shares of Common Stock under the Plan at 1% percent of the outstanding number of shares as of January&nbsp;1 of the applicable year. However, the board of directors
	reserves the right to determine that there will be no increase for any year or that any increase will be for a lesser number of shares. The number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP is subject to adjustment in the event of
	a stock split, stock dividend or other change in the Company&#146;s capitalization. The ESPP may be terminated or amended by the board of directors at any time, but will automatically terminate upon the tenth anniversary of the date the ESPP is
	approved by the stockholders. An amendment that increases the number of shares of common stock that are authorized under the ESPP and certain other amendments require the approval of the stockholders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	All employees who are whose customary employment is for more than 20 hours a week are eligible to participate in the ESPP. Any employee who
	owns 5% or more of the voting power or value of the Company&#146;s shares of common stock is not eligible to purchase shares under the ESPP. Each employee who is a participant in the ESPP may purchase shares by authorizing payroll deductions of up
	to 10% of his or her base compensation during an offering period. Unless the participating employee has previously withdrawn from the offering, his or her accumulated payroll deductions will be used to purchase shares of common stock on the last
	business day of the offering period at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the first business day or the last business day of the offering period, whichever is lower, provided that no more than 5,000 shares of
	common stock may be purchased by any one employee during each offering period. Under applicable tax rules, an employee may purchase no more than $25,000 worth of stock, valued at the start of the purchase period, under the ESPP in any calendar year.

	resulting in 12,140 shares vesting in such period. The Company recorded the excess grant date fair value over the proceeds received as compensation expense. The Company recorded $7 of stock-based compensation expense related to this award in the

	The Company classifies its United States Treasury securities as Level 1 assets under the fair value hierarchy as these assets have been valued
	using quoted market prices in active markets without any valuation adjustment. The Company classifies its certificates of deposit as Level 2 assets under the fair value hierarchy, as there are no quoted market prices in active markets, and its
	agency bonds as Level 2 assets under the fair value hierarchy, as these assets are not always valued daily using quoted market prices in active markets.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As previously discussed (see Notes 5 and 7), the Company issued warrants to purchase Series AA preferred stock in connection with the 2013
	Series AA preferred stock issuance and Loan Agreements. The Series AA warrant liabilities were recorded at their fair value on the date of issuance and were remeasured on each subsequent balance sheet date and as of the warrant exercise date, with
	fair value changes recognized as income (decrease in fair value) or expense (increase in fair value) in other income (expense) in the statements of operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Prior to the IPO, in addition to the assumptions above, the Company&#146;s estimated fair value of the Series AA preferred stock warrant
	liabilities is calculated using other key assumptions including the probability of an exit event, the enterprise value as determined on an income approach, and a discount for lack of marketability. Management, with the assistance of an independent
	valuation firm, made these subjective determinations based on available current information.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company used a hybrid valuation model in
	which a Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the fair value of the Company&#146;s equity securities under three scenarios including: i) an IPO scenario, ii) a merger or acquisition scenario or iii) a stay private scenario. The Company then
	probability-weighted each equity value derived from the Monte Carlo simulation based upon the Company&#146;s estimate of the likelihood of the exit scenario occurring.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the warrants represent the Company&#146;s best estimates and include probabilities of
	settlement scenarios, enterprise value, time to liquidity, risk-free interest rates, discount for lack of marketability and volatility. The estimates are based, in part, on subjective assumptions and could differ materially in the future. Generally,
	increases or decreases in the fair value of the underlying convertible preferred stock would result in a directionally similar impact in the fair value measurement of the warrant liability. The following table details the assumptions used in the
	Black-Scholes option pricing model used to estimate the fair value of the Series AA preferred stock warrants as of February&nbsp;17, 2015, the date upon which the Series AA preferred stock warrants became exercisable for common stock, and the Monte
	Carlo simulation model used to estimate the fair value of the Series AA preferred stock warrants at December&nbsp;31, 2014:

	transaction proceeds, depending upon the level of transaction proceeds received in the transaction), and each participant is entitled to receive a bonus equal to a certain percentage of such bonus pool. The MIP terminates automatically upon the
