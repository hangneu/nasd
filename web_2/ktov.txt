	listing for trading and fund raising related activities, general administrative and other expenses. We may incur significant additional
	losses as we continue to focus our resources on advancing our therapeutic candidates. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve
	profitability depends mainly upon our ability, alone or with others, to successfully develop our therapeutic candidates and obtain
	the required regulatory approvals in various territories and then commercialize our therapeutic candidates. We may be unable to
	achieve any or all of these goals with regard to our therapeutic candidates. As a result, we may never be profitable or achieve

	We plan to fund our future operations through commercialization and out-licensing of our therapeutic candidates and either debt
	or equity financing. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at
	all, or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. We may have difficulty raising needed capital or
	securing a development or commercialization partner in the future as a result of, among other factors, our lack of revenues from
	commercialization of the therapeutic candidates, as well as the inherent business risks associated with our company and present
	and future market conditions. In addition, global and local economic and geopolitical conditions may make it more difficult for
	us to raise needed capital or secure a development or commercialization partner in the future and may impact our liquidity. If
	we are unable to obtain future financing, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research,
	development or commercialization programs related to our therapeutic candidates, any of which may have a material adverse effect
	on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, to the extent we are able to raise capital through the

	While we have

	We have reached an
	agreement with the FDA to conduct the Phase III clinical trial for KIT-302 pursuant to an SPA agreement. The FDA&rsquo;s SPA process
	is designed to facilitate the FDA&rsquo;s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and
	size of Phase III trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a therapeutic candidate&rsquo;s efficacy.
	Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor&rsquo;s questions
	regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial design and data analysis plans, within 45 days of receipt of the
	request. The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory
	approval of the therapeutic candidate with respect to its effectiveness and safety against the indication studied. All agreements
	and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding an SPA agreement must be clearly documented in an SPA letter or the
	minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA. Nevertheless, an SPA agreement does not guarantee approval of a therapeutic
	candidate, and even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analysis proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process,
	the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement in certain circumstances. In particular, an SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if
	public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the SPA agreement, other new scientific concerns regarding
	product safety or efficacy arise, the sponsor company fails to comply with the agreed upon trial protocols, or the relevant data,
	assumptions or information provided by the sponsor in a request for the SPA change or are found to be false or omit relevant facts.
	In addition, even after an SPA agreement is finalized, the SPA agreement may be modified, and such modification will be deemed
	binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing
	to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion
	in interpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA agreement.
	A revocation or alteration in our existing SPA agreement could significantly delay or prevent approval of our application. Our
	SPA agreement with the FDA does not ensure that KIT-302 will receive marketing approval or that the approval process will be faster
	than conventional regulatory procedures.&nbsp; Further, we cannot assure you that the reported results of our Phase III clinical
	trial of KIT-302 will result in any FDA approval for KIT-302.&nbsp; While we believe that our Phase III clinical trial has been
	completed in accordance with the SPA agreement, and that the data generated met the endpoints that have been agreed in the SPA
	agreement to represent adequate evidence of effectiveness, if the FDA revokes or alters its agreement under the SPA agreement,
	or if the FDA interprets the data collected from the clinical trial differently than we do, the FDA may not deem the data sufficient
	to support an application for regulatory approval, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
	results of operations.

	On March 23, 2010,
	President Obama signed the &ldquo;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&rdquo; (P.L. 111-148) and on March 30, 2010, the President
	signed the &ldquo;Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act&rdquo; (P.L. 111-152), collectively commonly referred to as the
	&ldquo;Healthcare Reform Law.&rdquo; The Health Reform Law included a number of new rules regarding health insurance, the provision
	of health care, and conditions to reimbursement for healthcare services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients. Through the
	rule making process, substantial changes have been and continue to be made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the
	United States, including changes made in order to extend medical benefits to those who lack insurance coverage. Extending coverage
	to a large population could substantially change the structure of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing
	medical services and drugs. This legislation is one of the most comprehensive and significant reforms ever experienced by the United
	States in the healthcare industry and is expected to have meaningful ramifications on tens of millions of citizens in the United
	States. This legislation is expected to impact the scope of healthcare insurance, the insurance refunds from the insurance companies
	and possibly also the costs of medical products.&nbsp;Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Law&rsquo;s provisions are designed to
	encourage providers to find cost savings in their clinical operations. Pharmaceuticals represent a significant portion of the cost
	of providing care. Through modified reimbursement rates and other incentives, the United States government is requiring that providers
	identify the most cost-effective services, supplies and pharmaceuticals. This environment has caused changes in the purchasing
	habits of providers and resulted in specific attention to the pricing negotiation, product selection and utilization review surrounding
	pharmaceuticals. To the extent that our therapeutic candidates are at some point reimbursable by U.S federal government programs,
	this attention may result in our therapeutic candidates being chosen less frequently or the pricing being substantially lowered.
	However, the effect of the legislation is difficult to predict and, at this stage, we are unable to estimate the full extent of
	the direct and/or indirect impact of the legislation on us.

	These structural changes
	could entail modifications to the existing system of private payors and government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid and State
	Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program), creation of a government-sponsored healthcare insurance source, or some combination
	of both, as well as other changes. Restructuring the coverage of medical care in the United States could impact the reimbursement
	for prescribed drugs and pharmaceuticals, such as those we and our development and/or commercialization partners are currently
	developing. If reimbursement for our approved therapeutic candidates, if any, is substantially reduced in the future, or rebate
	obligations associated with them are substantially increased, our business could be materially and adversely impacted.

	Extending medical benefits
	to those who currently lack coverage will likely result in substantial cost to the United States federal government, which may
	force significant additional changes to the healthcare system in the United States. Much of the funding for expanded healthcare
	coverage may be sought through cost savings. While some of these savings may come from realizing greater efficiencies in delivering
	care, improving the effectiveness of preventive care and enhancing the overall quality of care, much of the cost savings may come
	from reducing the cost of care. Cost of care could be reduced by decreasing the level of reimbursement for medical services or
	products (including those pharmaceuticals currently being developed by us or our development and/or commercialization partners),
	or by restricting coverage (and, thereby, utilization) of medical services or products. In either case, a reduction in the utilization

	Several States and
	private entities initially mounted legal challenges to the healthcare reform legislation, and they continue to litigate various
	aspects of the legislation. On July 26, 2012, the United States Supreme Court generally upheld the healthcare reform legislation
	as constitutional. However, the Supreme Court held that the legislation improperly required the States to expand their Medicaid
	programs to cover more individuals. As a result, the States have a choice as to whether they will expand the numbers of individuals
	covered by their respective State Medicaid programs. Some States have determined that they will not expand their Medicaid programs
	and will develop other cost saving and coverage measures to provide care to currently uninsured residents. Many of these efforts
	to date have included the institution of Medicaid managed care programs. The manner in which these cost saving measures are implemented
	could have a materially adverse effect on our financial performance. Further, the healthcare regulatory environment has seen significant
	changes in recent years and is still in flux. We cannot predict the impact on our business of future legal challenges to the healthcare
	reform legislation or other changes to the current laws and regulations.

<FONT STYLE="BACKGROUND-COLOR: WHITE">

	We are incorporated
	under the laws of the State of Israel, our principal offices are located in central Israel and some of our officers, employees,
	consultants and directors are residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding
	region may directly affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have
	taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade
	within Israel or between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations and could
	make it more difficult for us to raise capital. In 2008, 2012, and again in the summer of 2014, Israel was engaged in an armed
	conflict with Hamas, a militia group and political party operating in the Gaza Strip, and during the summer of 2006, Israel was
	engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist Shiite militia group and political party. These conflicts involved
	missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. Political
	uprisings and civil resistance demonstrations in various countries in the Middle East, including Egypt and Syria, have affected
	the political stability of those countries. It is not clear how this instability, will develop and how it will affect the political
	and security situation in the Middle East. This instability may lead to deterioration of the political relationships that exist
	between Israel and these countries, and have raised concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict.
	The tension between Israel and Iran or extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, may escalate
	in the future and turn violent, which could affect the Israeli economy generally and us in particular. Any armed conflicts, terrorist
	activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations.
	Parties with whom we may do business have sometimes declined to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension,
	forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary.
<FONT STYLE="BACKGROUND-COLOR: WHITE">
	The conflict situation in Israel
	could cause situations where medical product certifying or auditing bodies could not be able to visit manufacturing facilities
	of our subcontractors in Israel in order to review our certifications or clearances, thus possibly leading to temporary suspensions
	or even cancellations of our product clearances or certifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conflict situation in Israel could also result
	in parties with&nbsp;whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their
	commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements.&nbsp;

	Furthermore, Israeli

	shares of the participating companies are subject to certain restrictions. Moreover, with respect to certain share swap transactions,

	Directors are not selected, or recommended for board of director selection, as required by the NASDAQ Listing Rules, by independent

	such as for the establishment or amendment of certain equity based compensation plans, an issuance that will result in a change
	of control of the company, certain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in the
	company and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company. Following our home country governance practices as

	The depositary for
	the ADSs has agreed to pay investors in our ADSs the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on ordinary
	shares or other deposited securities underlying the ADSs, after deducting its fees and expenses. Investors in our ADSs will receive
	these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares their ADSs represent. However, the depositary is not responsible
	if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, it would
	be unlawful to make a distribution to a holder of ADSs if it consists of securities that require registration under the Securities
	Act of 1933, as amended or the Securities Act, but that are not properly registered or distributed under an applicable exemption
	from registration. In addition, conversion into U.S. dollars from foreign currency that was part of a dividend which was distributed
	in foreign currency made in respect of deposited ordinary shares may require the approval or license of, or a filing with, any
	government or agency thereof, which may be unobtainable. In these cases, the depositary may determine not to distribute such property
	and hold it as &ldquo;deposited securities&rdquo; or may seek to affect a substitute dividend or distribution, including net cash
	proceeds from the sale of the dividends that the depositary deems an equitable and practicable substitute. We have no obligation
	to register under U.S. securities laws any ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or other securities received through such distributions.
	We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else
	to holders of ADSs. In addition, the depositary may withhold from such dividends or distributions its fees and an amount on account
	of taxes or other governmental charges to the extent the depositary believes it is required to make such withholding. This means
	that investors in our ADSs may not receive the same distributions or dividends as those we make to the holders of our ordinary
	shares, and, in some limited circumstances, investors in our ADSs may not receive any value for such distributions or dividends
	if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them available to investors in our ADSs. These restrictions may cause a material
	decline in the value of the ADSs.

	Holders of our ADSs
	do not have the same rights as our shareholders and may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying ordinary

	to convene a shareholders&rsquo; meeting is no less than 35 or 21 calendar days, depending on the proposals on the agenda for the

	meeting to permit them to withdraw their ordinary shares to allow them to cast their vote with respect to any specific matter.
	In addition, the depositary and its agents may not be able to send voting instructions to holders of our ADSs or carry out their

	the effect of any such vote. As a result, holders of our ADSs may not be able to exercise their right to vote and they may lack

	with the second annual report that we file with the SEC after the closing of our initial U.S. offering in November 2015, our management
	will be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, once we no longer

	discussed above and depending on our status as per Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, our independent registered public accounting
	firm may also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. We have only
	very recently commenced the process of determining whether our existing internal controls over financial reporting systems are
	compliant with Section 404 and whether there are any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our existing internal controls.
	This process will require the investment of substantial time and resources, including by our chief financial officer and other
	members of our senior management. As a result, this process may divert internal resources and take a significant amount of time
	and effort to complete. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of this determination and whether we will need to implement
	remedial actions in order to implement effective controls over financial reporting. The determination and any remedial actions
	required could result in us incurring additional costs that we did not anticipate, including the hiring of outside consultants.
	Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stated
	results of operations and harm our reputation. As a result, we may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses, as well
	as higher independent auditor fees during and after the implementation of these changes. If we are unable to implement any of the
	required changes to our internal control over financial reporting effectively or efficiently or are required to do so earlier than
	anticipated, it could adversely affect our operations, financial reporting and/or results of operations and could result in an
	adverse opinion on internal controls from our independent auditors and cause the market price of our ordinary shares ADSs and warrants

	In October 2012,
	the District Court in Lod approved the creditors arrangement in accordance with Section 350 of the Companies Law in order to effectuate
	the sale by Kitov Holdings (then known as Mainrom Line Logistics Ltd.) of all its activities, assets, rights, obligations and liabilities
	to a private company held by its then controlling shareholders, and all rights of Kitov Holdings&rsquo; creditors against it were
	extinguished. The sale was made pursuant to an arrangement between Kitov Holdings and its creditors. Following such sale and a
	related cash distribution to Kitov Holdings&rsquo; shareholders, Kitov Holdings remained without any assets, debt and/or liabilities.
	As described in the District Court approval, in connection with the sale, on October 31, 2012, the former controlling shareholders
	sold control of Kitov Holdings (then a shell company) to Mr. Sheer Roichman. From the completion of these transactions until the
	completion of the acquisition of Kitov Pharmaceuticals described below, Kitov Holdings did not conduct any business activities
	and was a public shell company listed on the TASE with no assets, debt and/or liabilities.

	we announced that the Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for our leading drug candidate, KIT-302, successfully
	met the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial protocol as approved by the FDA. Data from the trial further revealed that KIT-302
	tended to reduce blood pressure more than the widely used hypertension drug amlodipine besylate when administered alone. We plan

	A combination drug,
	KIT-302, simultaneously treats pain caused by osteoarthritis and treats hypertension, which is a common side effect of stand-alone

	of pain caused by osteoarthritis and amlodipine besylate, a drug designed to treat hypertension.

	The trial protocol,
	approved by the FDA through the SPA process, was designed to quantify the decrease of hypertension in patients receiving KIT-302.
	The trial was performed in the U.K. in four groups of twenty-six (26) to forty-nine (49) patients, with a total of 152 patients.
	Each patient was treated over a total period of two weeks. Group One was treated with KIT-302, comprised of celecoxib and amlodipine
	besylate. Group Two was treated with amlodipine besylate only, one of the components of KIT-302. Group Three was treated with celecoxib
	only, the other component of KIT-302. Group Four was treated with a double placebo. The trial began in June 2014 and was completed

	In addition to the
	aforementioned medical and economic advantages, we believe the combination drugs that we have developed have several commercial
	advantages, such as reduced development time compared to the development time of new chemical entities (NCEs) and decreased risk
	factors in the development process. These commercial advantages derive from the fact that combination drugs are based on known
	materials already approved for use by the FDA. The FDA offers a shortened regulatory procedure referred to as a &ldquo;505(b)(2)
	NDA&rdquo; to approve combination drugs. This procedure may be used to file a request to approve a product that relies on the results
	of the safety and effectiveness trials performed for the components of the combination in the past by others and not by the filers
	of the request for approval. Accordingly, the approval process in a 505(b)(2) NDA is shorter and less expensive compared to the
	approval process for NCEs. In addition, the use of known, proven and safe components recognized by physicians and medical organizations,
	and the enhanced medical effect of concurrently treating and preventing hypertension, may shorten the time and decrease the costs
	usually required for the acceptance of the new product in the drug marketplace.

	Arthritis
	means joint inflammation. The term is used to describe the pain, stiffness and/or swelling in the joints of the body where one
	or more bones are joined by ligaments. A normal joint provides a smooth surface enabling adjacent bones to move and glide on each
	other during normal motion. In contrast, an arthritic joint is one that may have varying degrees of inflammation and possibly destruction
	of the joint cartilage. These destructive changes preclude normal motion and cause pain.

	The
	most common type of arthritis is called osteoarthritis and is more common with advancing age. People with osteoarthritis usually
	have joint pain and a decreased range of joint movement. Unlike some other forms of arthritis, osteoarthritis affects only the
	joints. This condition is also sometimes called degenerative joint disease. Osteoarthritis primarily affects the joint cartilage.
	Healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over one another and absorbs energy from the shock of physical movement. However, with
	osteoarthritis, the surface layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away. This allows the bony surface of the different bones
	under the cartilage to rub together, causing, pain, swelling, and loss of motion of the joint. Over time, affected joints may lose
	their normal shape. Also, bone spurs, small growths called osteophytes, may grow on the edges of the joint further impairing joint
	function. Thus, bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space, causing more pain and possible damage.

	Various non pharmacological

	In some cases, the
	conservative non pharmacological treatments are not sufficiently helpful. In such cases, patients typically request medical treatment.
	According to data published on the website of the Mayo Clinic in April 2013, the most common medical treatments are the use of
	analgesics, such as NSAIDs, which include enzyme inhibitors, such as COX-2. NSAIDs treat inflammation by inhibiting enzymes responsible
	for the development of inflammation and subsequent pain. COX-2 enzyme inhibitors are non-steroidal drugs that treat inflammation
	by directly inhibiting COX-2, an enzyme responsible for the development of inflammation and subsequent pain but do not target the
	COX-1 enzyme. Targeting selectivity for COX-2 reduces the risk of&nbsp;peptic ulceration, and is the main advantage of&nbsp;celecoxib,
	rofecoxib&nbsp;and other members of this drug class over non COX-2 selective NSAIDs.

	A typical osteoarthritis

	using NSAIDs, which will begin using drugs such as Ibuprofen followed by naproxen and/or other NSAIDs (more than 20 types of drugs,

	Hypertension treatment
	methods focus on reducing the patient&rsquo;s blood pressure to normal values, thereby preventing the occurrence of complications
	in the long term. Even a small increase in blood pressure may cause significant cardiovascular problems. For example, it has been
	shown that any increase in blood pressure above a systolic value of 115 mm Hg is associated with an increased risk of suffering
	a cardiovascular death (Prospective Studies Collaboration, The Lancet 2002). This finding has been repeatedly replicated and it
	is now established that there is no safe level of blood pressure increase above of the &ldquo;normotensive baseline value&rdquo;
	of approximately 120 systolic and 70 diastolic. The documentation of a danger of any increase in blood pressure above a value of
	120/70 was recently documented in September of 2015 in a large NIH sponsored clinical trial (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/press-releases/2015/landmark-nih-study-shows-intensive-blood-pressuremanagement-may-save-lives.)
	which enrolled over 9000 patients age 50 and older. This study also documented that patients age 50 and older with systolic blood
	pressures greater than 120 had a greater rate of adverse cardiovascular events than did those whose systolic blood pressure was
	treated to levels below 120.

	It has been recognized
	for many decades that hypertension requires treatment. This fact has been recently re-emphasized by a paper that reviewed 147 prior
	randomized studies of antihypertensive treatments. This meta-analysis study (Law MR et al, BMJ 2009), concluded that the majority
	of the adult population with hypertension can be expected to benefit considerably from using anti-hypertension drugs.

	Hypertension can be
	treated with many different classes of medications. These include diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers,
	ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists and vasodilators. In general, these medications work by either relaxing blood
	vessels and thereby lowering the pressure in arteries, or by assisting the body in removing fluid and thereby decreasing the pressure
	inside of arteries.

	Although drugs from
	each of the various classes of antihypertension medications are able to reduce blood pressure, there are marked differences in
	their side effects profiles. For example, the diuretics can result in kidney problems, while the beta blockers can slow the heart
	rate. It is therefore important for physicians carefully to select which antihypertension medications to prescribe for patients
	based upon the patient&rsquo;s other medical problems, including what concomitant medications they are receiving.

	Blood pressure can
	undergo significant alterations when subjects are placed on various medications. For example, according to a May 2010 FDA Joint
	Meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee report published by the
	FDA, an increase of about 3.5 mm Hg was diagnosed following the use of naproxen, while the use of Celebrex causes an increase of
	about 2.5 mm Hg. In addition, in August 2011 the FDA issued a Safety Information release stating that co-administration of NSAIDs,
	including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors or with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, may result in deterioration
	of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and that the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors may be attenuated
	by NSAIDs. No such Safety Information release was issued with regard to calcium channel blockers, which is the anti-hypertensive
	used in our therapeutic candidates.

	Studies estimate that
	approximately 13.5 million patients in the U.S. alone may suffer concurrently from hypertension and chronic osteoarthritis pain
	in the joints, according to data published by the CDC. We are developing two combinations, KIT-301 based on the generic drugs naproxen
	and isradipine, and KIT-302 based on the generic drugs celecoxib and amlodipine besylate. Both naproxen and celecoxib are active
	ingredients of known and approved-for-use drugs designed primarily to relieve pain caused by osteoarthritis. Celecoxib is the active
	ingredient in the branded drug &ldquo;Celebrex&reg;&rdquo;. Our combinations are designed to simultaneously relieve pain caused
	by osteoarthritis and treat hypertension, which is one of the side effects of using NSAIDs for treating pain caused by osteoarthritis.
	Our strategy in developing our therapeutic candidates is based on our belief that the added anti-hypertensive drug will decrease
	the side effect of increased hypertension typically caused by the use of NSAIDs alone.

	To date, no combination
	drug exists that offers the combined treatment of pain caused by osteoarthritis and hypertension. We therefore believe that KIT-301
	and KIT-302 potentially hold significant advantages over the currently available drugs in the market, due to the fact that the
	drug treatment of osteoarthritis together with hypertension eases the burden of the treatment process for patients by providing
	the ability to use one drug instead of multiple drugs concurrently, thereby increasing the patients&rsquo; ease of compliance with
	the required treatment. KIT-301 does not include a treatment for gastrointestinal problems caused by the use of naproxen, the generic
	drug that is one of the components of KIT-301. In contrast, KIT-302 uses celecoxib, an NSAID that does not produce the extent of
	gastrointestinal side effects seen with other NSAIDs. For professional considerations and in order to manage our financial and
	human resources, we intend to advance the development of KIT-302 first, and only then consider the further development of KIT-301.

	Our strategy is to
	develop two drug combinations that are intended to treat hypertension and pain caused by osteoarthritis. These combinations are
	comprised of known and approved-for-use components, the combination of which is intended to simultaneously treat the pain caused
	by osteoarthritis and reduce blood pressure, thereby offsetting a side effect caused by the use of NSAIDs for osteoarthritis. Following
	discussions with the FDA, the FDA approved a development design in accordance with the 505(b)(2) NDA track. The FDA did not require
	us to perform pre-clinical trials (
<I>
	i.e.
</I>
	, animal studies), and therefore we are required only to conduct a single Phase III
	clinical trial and a single standard pharmacokinetic trial, or PK Trial, for each of our therapeutic candidates.

	For the development
	of KIT-302, we performed a double blind, placebo controlled, Phase III clinical trial for testing the decrease of hypertension
	in patients receiving our KIT-302 therapeutic candidate. This trial was performed in the U.K. in four groups of twenty-six (26)
	to forty-nine (49) patients (a total of 152 patients), with each patient treated over a total period of two weeks. Group One was
	treated with the two components of KIT-302 (celecoxib and amlodipine besylate)., Group Two was treated with a standard drug available
	in the market for treating hypertension (amlodipine besylate, one of the components of KIT-302), Group Three was treated with celecoxib
	only, and Group Four received a double placebo The trial began in June 2014, and the final patient completed the study in November
	2015.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0PT 0; TEXT-ALIGN: JUSTIFY; TEXT-INDENT: 28.35PT">
	The purpose of the
	trial was to show that a combination of the two components of KIT-302, as demonstrated in Group One, lowered blood pressure by
	at least 50% as compared to the reduction in blood pressure in patients in Group Two (treatment with amlodipine besylate only);
	however, we were not required to demonstrate or measure efficacy in treatment of pain caused by osteoarthritis. Group Three and
	Group Four were for control purposes and will not be considered in evaluating the primary endpoint. The trial was conducted with
	off-the-shelf drugs, while the combination drug was being developed in parallel by Dexcel Ltd., or Dexcel. The trial was being
	conducted with only one dosage of amlodipine besylate (10 mg), although we expect to seek marketing approval from the FDA for three
	dosages (10mg, 5 mg, and 2.5 mg), each combined with 200 mg of celecoxib. We announced the top line trial results in December 2015,
	showing that we successfully met the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial protocol as approved by the FDA. Data from the trial
	further revealed that KIT-302 tended to reduce blood pressure more than the widely used hypertension drug amlodipine besylate alone.

	The trial results
	demonstrated that the number of 152 patients treated was adequate to provide statistical validity and therefore, the results were
	final. These final results showed that in patients treated with amlodipine besylate only, there was a mean reduction in daytime
	systolic blood pressure of 8.8 mm Hg. In patients treated with KIT-302, there was a mean reduction in daytime systolic blood pressure
	of 10.6 mm Hg. Therefore, the primary efficacy endpoint of the study has been successfully achieved with a p value of 0.001.

	Additional data from
	the trial results showed the favorable blood pressure effects of KIT-302 were present in all blood pressure variables measured
	in the study. The data indicated that the blood pressure reduction synergy seen with combining celecoxib and amlodipine, is seen
	not only in the study&rsquo;s primary efficacy endpoint of daytime systolic blood pressure, but was also seen for daytime diastolic
	blood pressure measurements, and in all other blood pressure variables. After two weeks of treatment the reduction for daytime
	diastolic blood pressure measurements with amlodipine alone was 5.5 mm Hg, while for patients treated with KIT-302's components
	the reduction was 7.6 mm Hg. For nighttime systolic blood pressure after two weeks of treatment the reduction with amlodipine therapy
	alone was 6.3 mm Hg, while for patients treated with KIT-302's components the reduction was 10.7 mm Hg. For nighttime diastolic
	blood pressure after two weeks of treatment the reduction with amlodipine besylate alone was 3.1 mm Hg, while for patients treated
	with KIT-302's components the reduction was 7.2 mm Hg. Thus, the synergy in blood pressure reduction demonstrated with KIT-302&rsquo;s
	two components was present at all times of day and with both blood pressure measures. Although celecoxib when combined with amlodipine
	appears to have a synergistic effect and lowers blood pressure, it has the opposite effect when administered by itself.&nbsp; While
	not conclusive, we believe the medical community may take great interest in this study&rsquo;s findings and its implications for
	pain management and hypertension.

	The pharmaceutical
	market is characterized by large international pharmaceutical companies that develop a wide range of products, both generic and
	NCEs, which operate alongside smaller companies, such as ours, that develop a specific drug or a combination of drugs. Therefore,
	many small companies enter into agreements with such global companies during the drug development stage in order to continue the
	development or marketing of the drug, taking advantage of the financial, marketing and/or other resources available to such global
	companies. At the same time, the global companies tend to enter into agreements with smaller companies in order to save development
	time and resources. The global drug sector is a highly developed market with a turnover of hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars
	and intense competition. Most of the drugs we intend to develop have competing drugs, developed at the same time by other companies
	and organizations. We are therefore exposed to competition in our field of operation. Although we believe our therapeutic candidates
	have advantages which our competitors&rsquo; products lack, there is a constant risk in the drug development field that a competing
	party will complete the development stages before we are able to develop our therapeutic candidates intended for the same disease.
	Moreover, a constant threat in our market is presented by new drugs that have already completed all the development stages and
	have already entered the market and are competing with the treatments and drugs previously available on the market. All of the
	therapeutic candidates that we are currently developing are intended for oral use.

	Due to the voluntary

	risk will be required to approve new NSAID products that may be used on an intermittent or chronic basis. We believe that KIT-302
	has a competitive advantage over other drugs in the market because, as a COX-2 inhibitor, it has limited gastrointestinal side

	In the branded pharmaceutical

	market exclusivity. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are
	approved and marketed, there can often be very substantial and rapid declines in the branded product&rsquo;s sales. The rate of
	this decline varies by country and by therapeutic category, and the number of generic competitor entrants to the market, among
	other factors; however, following patent expiration, branded products often continue to have market viability based upon the goodwill

	Patents are a key determinant
	of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the brand company with the right to exclude others from
	practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses
	of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture
	of products, and polymorphs. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates
	of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type
	of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.

	Market exclusivity
	is also sometimes influenced by regulatory exclusivity rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for
	the development of medicines. For example, the U.S., the European Union and Japan each provide for a minimum period of time after
	the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the data of the original party who developed the
	drug to approve a competitor&rsquo;s generic copy. Regulatory exclusivity rights are also available in certain markets as incentives
	for research on new indications, on orphan drugs and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. Regulatory exclusivity
	rights are independent of any patent rights and can be particularly important when a drug lacks broad patent protection. Most regulatory
	forms of exclusivity, however, do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory
	data exclusivity on the basis of the competitor&rsquo;s own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical
	to that marketed by the innovator.

	of market exclusivity for any of our branded products with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory
	forms of exclusivity, and inherent uncertainties concerning patent litigation. There can be no assurance that a particular product
	will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that we currently estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to

	of vaccines, the participants are healthy and the signs of efficacy can be obtained in early Phase I, therefore this Phase is defined
	as Phase I/II. Phase III clinical trials are usually multi-center, double-blind controlled trials in hundreds or even thousands

	Clinical trials must

	not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
	An institutional review board, or IRB, generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent at study sites
	that the IRB oversees and also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&rsquo;s
	requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified

	or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical study sponsor
	may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.

	If an NDA submission
	is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA&rsquo;s
	goal is to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant within ten months of submission, unless the application relates
	to an unmet medical need, or is for a serious or life-threatening indication, in which case the goal may be within six months of
	NDA submission. However, PDUFA goal dates are not legal mandates and the FDA response often occurs several months beyond the original
	PDUFA goal date. Further, the review process and the target response date under PDUFA may be extended if the FDA requests or the
	NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the NDA. The NDA
	review process can, accordingly, be very lengthy. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory
	committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the
	recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical studies are not always
	conclusive and the FDA and/or any advisory committee it appoints may interpret data differently than the applicant.

	After the FDA evaluates
	the NDA and inspects manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it will either approve commercial
	marketing of the drug product candidate with prescribing information for specific indications or issue a complete response letter
	indicating that the application is not ready for approval and stating the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval
	of the NDA. If the complete response letter requires additional data and the applicant subsequently submits that data, the FDA
	nevertheless may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA
	with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician
	communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk
	minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate
	controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing. Such post-marketing testing may include Phase IV
	clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&rsquo;s safety and efficacy after approval. Regulatory
	approval of drug product candidates for serious or life-threatening indications may require that participants in clinical studies
	be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug product candidate.

	If the FDA approves
	one of our therapeutic candidates, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval regulatory requirements. We would
	be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety
	and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our therapeutic
	candidates. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically
	inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping
	requirements. If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such as certain manufacturing changes, we will need FDA
	review and approval before the change can be implemented. For example, if we change the manufacturer of a product or our API, the
	FDA may require stability or other data from the new manufacturer, and such data will take time and are costly to generate, and
	the delay associated with generating these data may cause interruptions in our ability to meet commercial demand, if any. While
	physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for
	an indication that has not been approved. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the
	original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled studies that demonstrate
	the product&rsquo;s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such studies are conducted, the FDA may not approve any
	change in a timely fashion, or at all.

	it is absolutely convinced that the following conditions, among others, are fulfilled: (a) the expected benefits for the participant
	in the medical trial and to the requesting party to justify the risk and the inconvenience involved in the medical trial to its
	participant; (b) the available medical and scientific information justifies the performance to the requested medical trial; (c)
	the medical trial is planned in a scientific manner that enables a solution to the tested question and is described in a clear,

	Sales of our therapeutic
	candidates in the United States may depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the therapeutic candidates will be covered
	by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party
	payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health
	care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The
	United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment
	programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption
	of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls
	and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payers do not consider our therapeutic candidates
	to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our therapeutic candidates after approval as a benefit
	under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our therapeutic candidates on
	a profitable basis.

	The Medicare Prescription
	Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, (the MMA), imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription
	drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Under Part
	D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient
	prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement
	to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan
	sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies
	which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each
	therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary
	used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment
	for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for therapeutic candidates for which we receive marketing approval.
	However, any negotiated prices for our therapeutic candidates covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than
	the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private
	payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment
	that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.

	On February 17, 2009,
	President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This law provides funding for the federal government
	to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department
	of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic
	reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative
	effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear how such a result
	could be avoided and what if any effect the research will have on the sales of our therapeutic candidates, if any such therapeutic
	candidates or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness
	research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&rsquo;s product could adversely affect the sales of our therapeutic candidates.
	Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our therapeutic candidates or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our therapeutic
	candidates could reduce physician usage of the therapeutic candidates and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results
	of operations and financial condition.

	On March 23, 2010,
	President Obama signed into legislation the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was subsequently amended by the Healthcare
	and Education Reconciliation Act (as amended, the Affordable Care Act). The Affordable Care Act will result in sweeping changes
	across the health care industry. The primary goal of this comprehensive legislation is to extend health insurance coverage to currently
	uninsured legal U.S. residents through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. To
	fund the expansion of insurance coverage, the Affordable Care Act contains measures designed to promote quality and cost efficiency
	in health care delivery and to generate budgetary savings in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s
	provisions are designed to encourage providers to find cost savings in their clinical operations. Pharmaceuticals represent a significant
	portion of the cost of providing care. Through modified reimbursement rates and other incentives, the U.S. government is requiring
	that providers identify the most cost-effective services, supplies and pharmaceuticals. This environment has caused changes in
	the purchasing habits of providers and resulted in specific attention to the pricing negotiation, product selection and utilization
	review surrounding pharmaceuticals. This attention may result in our therapeutic candidates being chosen less frequently or the
	pricing being substantially lowered. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act is expected to expand and increase industry rebates
	for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot
	predict the impact of the Affordable Care Act on pharmaceutical companies as many of the Affordable Care Act reforms require the
	promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. The legislation also includes
	significant provisions that encourage state and federal law enforcement agencies to increase activities related to preventing,
	detecting and prosecuting those who commit fraud, waste and abuse in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid
	and Tricare. Since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, numerous regulations have been issued providing further guidance on
	its requirements. The Affordable Care Act continues to be implemented through regulation and government activity but is subject
	to possible amendment, additional implementing regulations and interpretive guidelines. Several states have decided not to expand
	their Medicaid programs and are seeking alternative reimbursement models to provide care to the uninsured. The manner in which
	these issues are resolved could materially affect the extent to which and the amount at which pharmaceuticals are reimbursed by
	government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare.

	Since commencement
	of our pharmaceutical research and development operations, we have generated significant losses mainly in connection with the research
	and development of our therapeutic candidates. Such research and development activities are expected to expand over time and will
	require further resources if we are to be successful. As a result, we expect to continue incurring operating losses, which may
	be substantial over the next several years, and will need to obtain additional funds to further develop our research and development
	programs. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $14.1 million.

	for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This means that an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; can delay the

	In April 2014, we entered

	the CMC work for KIT-302, and $500,000 for the final formulation PK trial for KIT-302. In addition, we will incur cost of approximately

	The term &ldquo;controlling

	is defined as (1) the right to vote at a general meeting of a company or a corresponding body of another corporation; or (2) the
	right to appoint directors of the corporation or its general manager. For the purpose of approving transactions with controlling
	shareholders, the term also includes any shareholder that holds 25% or more of the voting rights of the company if the company
	has no shareholder that owns more than 50% of its voting rights. For purposes of determining the holding percentage stated above,

	Under Israeli law,
	the initial term of an external director of an Israeli public company is three years.
<FONT STYLE="BACKGROUND-COLOR: WHITE">
	The
	Companies Law provides that after an initial term of three years, external directors may be re-elected to serve in that capacity
	for up to two additional three year terms, provided that either: (i) (1)&nbsp;his or her service for each such additional term
	is recommended by one or more shareholders holding in aggregate at least 1% of the company&rsquo;s voting rights and is approved
	at a shareholders meeting by a majority of the shares held by non-controlling shareholders who do not have a personal interest
	in the election of the external director (other than a personal interest not deriving from a relationship with a controlling shareholder)
	that are voted at the meeting, excluding for such purpose any abstentions, where the total number of shares held by non-controlling,
	disinterested shareholders voting for such reelection exceeds 2% of the aggregate voting rights in the company; and (2) the external
	director who has been nominated in such fashion by the shareholders is not a &ldquo;linked or competing shareholder&rdquo;, and
	does not have or has not had, on or within the two years preceding the date of such person&rsquo;s appointment to serve as another
	term as external director, any affiliation with a linked or competing shareholder. The term &ldquo;linked or competing shareholder&rdquo;
	means the shareholder(s) who nominated the external director for reappointment or a substantial shareholder of the company holding
	more than 5% of the shares in the company, provided that at the time of the reappointment, such shareholder(s) of the company,
	the controlling shareholder of such shareholder(s) of the company, or a company under such shareholder(s) of the company&rsquo;s
	control, has a business relationship with the company or are competitors of the company; (ii)&nbsp;his or her service for each
	such additional term is recommended by the board of directors and is approved at a shareholders meeting by the same disinterested
	majority required for the initial election of an external director (as described above); or (iii) the external director has proposed
	himself for reappointment and the reappointment was approved as provided in sub-section (i) above. The term of office for external
	directors for Israeli companies traded on certain foreign stock exchanges, including NASDAQ, may be further extended, indefinitely,
	in increments of additional three-year terms, in each case provided that, in addition to re-election in such manner described above:
	(1) the audit committee and subsequently the board of directors of the company confirm that, in light of the external director&rsquo;s
	expertise and special contribution to the work of the board of directors and its committees, the re-election for such additional
	period is beneficial to the company; and (2) prior to the approval of the reelection of the external director, the company&rsquo;s
	shareholders have been informed of the term previously served by such nominee and of the reasons why the board of directors and
	audit committee recommended the extension of such nominee&rsquo;s term.&nbsp;
</FONT>
	An external director may be removed by the
	same special majority of the shareholders required for his or her election, if he or she ceases to meet the statutory qualifications
	for appointment or if he or she violates his or her fiduciary duty to the company. An external director may also be removed by
	order of an Israeli court if the court finds that the external director is permanently unable to exercise his or her office, has
	ceased to meet the statutory qualifications for his or her appointment, has violated his or her fiduciary duty to the company,
	or has been convicted by a court outside Israel of certain offenses detailed in the Companies Law.

	the chief executive officer did not have a prior business relationship with the company or a controlling shareholder of the company

	labor court precedent rulings, as well as to certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General
	Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations including the Industrialists' Associations.
	These provisions of collective bargaining agreements are applicable to our Israeli employees by virtue of extension orders issued
	in accordance with relevant labor laws by the Israeli Ministry of Labor and Welfare, and which apply such agreement provisions
	to our employees even though they are not directly part of a union that has signed a collective bargaining agreement. The laws
	and labor court rulings that apply to our employees principally concern the minimum wage laws, procedures for dismissing employees,
	determination of severance pay, leaves of absence (such as annual vacation or maternity leave), sick pay and other conditions for
	employment. The extension orders which apply to our employees principally concern the requirement for length of the work day and
	workweek, mandatory contributions to a pension fund, annual recreation allowance, travel expenses payment and other conditions
	of employment. We generally provide our employees with benefits and working conditions beyond the required minimums.

	Israeli

	and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the United States
	Social Security Administration. Such amounts also include payments for national health insurance. A general practice also followed

	On November 27, 2013,
	we adopted the 2013 Kitov Pharmaceutical Holdings Ltd. Stock Option Allocation Plan, or the 2013 Option Plan. The 2013 Option Plan
	provides for the granting of options to our directors, officers, employees and consultants and to the directors, officers, employees
	and consultants of our subsidiaries and affiliates. The 2013 Option Plan provides for options to be granted at the determination
	of our board of directors (who is entitled to delegate its powers under the 2013 Option Plan to the Company's compensation committee)
	in accordance with applicable laws. The exercise price and vesting period are determined by our board of directors. As of March
	15, 2016, there were 2,233,753 non-tradable options exercisable into 213,657 ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding
	options under the 2013 Option Plan.

	Amount, and the Additional Principal Amount together with the Principal Amount, the Loan Amount. Such Additional Principal Amount,

	Principal Amount. The Principal Amount and the Additional Principal Amount did not bear interest and were not linked to any index.
	We did not exercise the option for the Additional Principal Amount. Each lender in the August Loan placed an order to purchase
	ADSs and warrants in the U.S. offering in an amount equal to or greater than such lender's Loan Amount. As such, and as we completed
	a U.S. Offering, we were required to repay the Loan Amount to each lender and also to pay each lender an allocation fee equal to

	that we received a lawsuit and motion to approve the lawsuit as a class action lawsuit pursuant to the Class Action Lawsuits Law
	5766-2006 (Motion) which was filed against us and our directors at the Tel Aviv District Court (Economic Division). The Motion
	is with respect to asserted claims for damages to the holders of our securities listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, arising
	due to our initial public offering of our securities in the U.S. during November 2015. In the Motion it was claimed that the class
	the petitioners are seeking to represent, namely, anyone holding our shares at the start of trading on November 22, 2015 exclusive
	of the respondents and/or anyone acting on their behalf and/or any affiliates thereof and excluding anyone whose rights to our
	shares derive from ADS certificates issued in the U.S to such extent as derived therefrom; and any holders of our Series 2 TASE
	listed warrants as of the start of trading on November 22, 2015, exclusive of the respondents and/or anyone acting on their behalf
	and/or any affiliates thereof (Purported Class). The total amount claimed from all defendants, if the Motion is certified as a
	class action, as set forth in the motion is approximately NIS 16.4 million. In addition to this amount, the petitioners in the
	motion are seeking remedies in order to redress discrimination against the Purported Class owing to the dilution caused by the
	public offering, including the possibility that the Purported Class should be awarded from the Company amounts reflecting the losses
	of the Purported Class from a possible price increase in the shares of the Company following the announcement of the Phase III

	. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each ordinary share held on all matters submitted
	to a vote of shareholders. The quorum required for an ordinary meeting of shareholders consists of at least two shareholders present,
	in person or by proxy, or who has sent us a voting instrument indicating the way in which he or she is voting, who hold or represent,
	in the aggregate, at least 25% of the voting rights of our outstanding share capital. A meeting adjourned for lack of a quorum
	is adjourned to the same day in the following week at the same time and place or any time and place as prescribed by the board
	of directors in notice to the shareholders. At the reconvened meeting one shareholder at least, present in person or by proxy constitutes
	a quorum except where such meeting was called at the demand of shareholders. With the agreement of a meeting at which a quorum
	is present, the chairman may, and on the demand of the meeting he must, adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to
	place, as the meeting resolves. Annual general meetings of shareholders are held once every year within a period of not more than
	15 months after the last preceding annual general shareholders&rsquo; meeting. The board of directors may call special general
	meetings of shareholders. The Companies Law provides that a special general meeting of shareholders may be called by the board
	of directors or by a request of two directors or 25% of the directors in office, whichever is the lower, or by shareholders holding

	Under the Companies

	transactions must be approved by both the board of directors and the audit committee and (i) must involve the extension of an existing
	transaction that was duly approved and does not involve any significant change in the terms of the existing transaction or the
	change is solely for the benefit of the company; (ii) is solely for the benefit of the company; (iii) is with the controlling shareholder
	or another person in which the controlling shareholder has an interest and the transaction is in accordance with the terms of a
	framework agreement that was duly approved; (iv) is with the controlling shareholder or another person in which the controlling
	shareholder has an interest, the purpose of which is a transaction of theirs with a third party or a joint proposal to enter into
	a transaction with a third party, and the terms of the transaction that apply to the controlling shareholder are not significantly
	different from the terms that apply to the controlling shareholder or an entity controlled by him or her (while taking into account
	the extent of their respective involvement in the transaction); (v) is among companies controlled by the controlling shareholder,
	or between the public company and the controlling shareholder or another person in which the controlling shareholder has a personal
	interest, and the transaction is on market terms, within the ordinary course of business and does not harm the company; or (vi)
	on the date of approval of the extraordinary transaction by the board of directors and audit committee, the shareholders who do
	not have personal interest in the approval of the said transactions do not hold more than 1% of the voting rights in the company.
	In addition, under such regulations, directors&rsquo; compensation and employment arrangements in a public company do not require
	the approval of the shareholders if both the compensation committee (or the audit committee acting in lieu of a compensation committee
	pursuant to the Companies Law) and the board of directors agree that such arrangements are solely for the benefit of the company.
	Also, employment and compensation arrangements for an office holder that is a controlling shareholder of a public company, or the
	provision of directors and officers insurance for the chief executive officer, do not require shareholder approval if certain criteria
	are met. The foregoing exemptions from shareholder approval will not apply if one or more shareholders holding at least 1% of the
	issued and outstanding share capital of the company or of the company&rsquo;s voting rights, objects to the use of these exemptions
	provided that such objection is submitted to the company in writing not later than fourteen days from the date of the filing of
	a report regarding the adoption of such resolution by the company. If such objection is duly and timely submitted, then the transaction
	or compensation arrangement of the directors will require shareholders&rsquo; approval as detailed above.

	Otherwise, under the Companies Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder, a private placement of securities does not require

	of a controlling interest to make an offer to acquire shares from the public, and as such Israeli companies that are publicly traded

	On April 1, 2014, we
	entered into a Development Services Agreement with Dexcel Ltd., or Dexcel, a global pharmaceutical company, which has been involved

	an NDA to the FDA. Dexcel&rsquo;s services include performing compatibility testing of APIs with excipients, screening to find
	at least two prototypes and identifying analytical methods for product analysis. We agreed to bear the cost of the APIs as well
	as other materials or means required for Dexcel to perform the services under the agreement. In exchange for these services, we
	will pay Dexcel: (i) $2 million in cash in four equal installments ($500,000 which was paid upon execution of the agreement, $500,000
	which was paid upon attainment of the second milestone in May 2015, and the remaining to be paid in two equal payments based on
	the remaining milestones during the development and manufacturing period); and (ii) in our ordinary shares having an aggregate
	value of $1.5 million issued in three equal installments (the first issuance of 157,783 ordinary shares was made upon execution
	of the agreement, the second issuance of 597,511 ordinary shares was made upon attainment of the second milestone in May 2015,

	On June 9, 2015 we,
	together with Dexcel, successfully completed the performance of a pilot pharmacokinetic clinical trial, or Pilot PK Study, which
	commenced on March 31, 2015 in Ichilov Medical Center in Tel Aviv. The objective of the Pilot PK Study was to demonstrate that
	the concentration of KIT-302 in the blood of the subjects is comparable to the concentrations observed in the administration of
	the two existing, approved drugs (celecoxib and amlodipine besylate, which are the active components of KIT-302). For the purpose
	of this Pilot PK Study, Dexcel manufactured two prototypes of the KIT-302 final formulation, based on the two existing approved
	drugs. The Pilot PK Study was performed with 15 subjects who were each treated with two different prototypes of the final formulation
	of KIT-302. During the course of the Pilot PK Study, blood samples were taken from the subjects following treatment with each of
	the two prototype formulations and following treatment with the two existing approved drugs (celecoxib and amlodipine besylate)
	separately for purposes of comparison, over a period of approximately six weeks. The Pilot PK Study demonstrated successful levels
	in the blood of the two prototype formulations, and one of the two final formulations that were tested met all the objectives of
	the study protocol and was selected for purposes of continuing the clinical development of KIT-302. In addition, based on the positive
	results achieved, we expect that the scope of the final PK study will be lower than originally expected.

	conditions are met: (i) the shares were purchased upon or after the registration of the securities on the stock exchange (this

	in respect of dividends distributed by an Israeli resident company to a U.S. resident: (i) if the U.S. resident is a corporation
	which holds during that portion of the taxable year which precedes the date of payment of the dividend and during the whole of
	its prior taxable year (if any), at least 10% of the outstanding shares of the voting stock of the Israeli resident paying corporation
	and not more than 25% of the gross income of the Israeli resident paying corporation for such prior taxable year (if any) consists
	of certain type of interest or dividends (other than dividend or interest received from subsidiary corporations, 50 percent or
	more of the outstanding shares of the voting stock of which is owned by the paying corporation at the time such dividends or interest
	is received) &ndash; the tax rate is 12.5%, (ii) if both the conditions mentioned in section (i) above are met and the dividend
	is paid from an Israeli resident company&rsquo;s income which was entitled to a reduced tax rate applicable to a Preferred Enterprise
	as defined in the Israel&rsquo;s Encouragement of Capital Investments Law (1959) &ndash; the tax rate is 15% and (iii) in all other
	cases, the tax rate is 25%. The aforementioned rates under the Israel U.S. Double Tax Treaty will not apply if the dividend income
	was derived through a permanent establishment of the U.S. resident in Israel.

	Subject to the discussion

	made to you with respect to our ADSs before reduction for any Israeli taxes withheld therefrom, generally will be includible in
	your income as dividend income to the extent such distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as
	determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Non-corporate U.S. Holders may qualify for the lower rates of taxation with
	respect to dividends on ADSs applicable to long-term capital gains (i.e., gains from the sale of capital assets held for more than
	one year), provided that certain conditions are met, including certain holding period requirements and the absence of certain risk
	reduction transactions. Moreover, such lower rate of taxation shall not apply if we are a PFIC for the taxable year in which it
	pays a dividend, or was a PFIC for the preceding taxable year. However, such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received
	deduction generally allowed to corporate U.S. Holders. To the extent that the amount of any distribution by us exceeds our current
	and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, it will be treated first as a tax-free
	return of your adjusted tax basis in our ADSs and thereafter as either long-term or short-term capital gain depending upon whether
	the U.S. Holder has held our ADSs for more than one year as of the time such distribution is received.

	U.S. federal income tax liability. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to
	specific classes of income. For this purpose, dividends generally constitute &ldquo;passive category income,&rdquo; or, in the

	Subject to certain

	Holder should be subject to tax at a preferential maximum tax rate of 20 percent. Distributions taxable as dividends paid on the
	our ADSs should qualify for the preferential 20 percent rate provided that either: (i) we are entitled to benefits under the income
	tax treaty between the United States and Israel (the &ldquo;Treaty&rdquo;) or (ii) our ADSs will be treated as readily tradable
	on an established securities market in the United States and certain other requirements are met. We believe that we will be entitled
	to benefits under the Treaty and that our ADSs will become readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States,
	and therefore any dividend distributions with respect to our ADSs should be &ldquo;qualified dividends&rdquo; eligible for the
	preferential tax rate. However, no assurance can be given that our ADSs will be treated as readily tradable. The preferential rate
	does not apply unless certain holding period requirements are satisfied. With respect to our ADSs, the U.S. Holder must have held
	such ADSs for at least 61 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The preferential rate also
	does not apply to dividends received from a passive foreign investment company (or classified as a passive foreign investment company
	in the preceding taxable year) or in respect of certain hedged positions or in certain other situations. The legislation enacting
	the preferential tax rate on qualified dividends contains special rules for computing the foreign tax credit limitation of a taxpayer
	who receives dividends subject to the preferential tax rate. U.S. Holders of our ADSs should consult their own tax advisors regarding
	the effect of these rules in their particular circumstances.

	our officers, directors and principal shareholders will be exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions
	contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we will not be required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports
	and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose securities are registered under the
	Exchange Act. However, we intend to file with the SEC, within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015
	and each subsequent fiscal year, an annual report on Form 20-F containing financial statements which will be examined and reported
	on, with an opinion expressed, by an independent registered public accounting firm. Furthermore, we have committed to the underwriters
	of our initial U.S public offering which was completed in November 2015 that for a period of three (3) years from November 25,
	2015, the Company, at its expense, will announce its financial information for each of the first three fiscal quarters consistent
	with the practices of companies dual-listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and a domestic U.S. securities exchange; provided that
	the foregoing shall not apply in the event the Company enters into a merger transaction in which the Company is the non-surviving
	entity that would cause our ADSs and warrants to no longer be registered under the Exchange Act. We will furnish this periodic

	Our foreign currency
	exposures give rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar, our functional and reporting currency,
	mainly against the NIS and other currencies. Although the U.S. dollar is our functional currency and reporting currency, a portion
	of our expenses are denominated in NIS. Our NIS expenses consist principally of payments to employees or service providers and
	short term investments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We anticipate that a sizable portion of our expenses will continue
	to be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar fluctuates significantly against the NIS it may
	have a negative impact on our results of operations. We manage our foreign exchange risk by aligning the currencies for holding
	short term investments with the currencies of expected expenses, based on our expected cash flows.

	Under
	NASDAQ Listing Rules, the Company must establish a compensation committee and adopt a formal written compensation committee charter

<FONT STYLE="BACKGROUND-COLOR: WHITE">

	public company which meets the has been established and conducts itself also in accordance with provisions governing the composition
	of&nbsp;&nbsp;the compensation committee as set forth in the Companies Law, may act in lieu of a compensation committee with respect
	to the responsibilities of a compensation committee which are set forth in the Companies Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our audit committee presently
	meets this requirement and our board of directors resolved on March 16, 2016 to have the audit committee as assume the responsibilities
	of the compensation committee pursuant to this new provision in the Companies Law. Additionally, we comply with the requirements
	set forth under the Companies Law, pursuant to which transactions with office holders regarding their terms of office and employment,
	and transactions with a controlling shareholder in a company regarding his or her employment and/or his or her terms of office
	with the company, may require the approval of the compensation committee (or the audit committee acting in lieu of a compensation
	committee in accordance with the Companies Law), the board of directors and under certain circumstances the shareholders, either
	in accordance with our previously approved compensation policy or, in special circumstances in deviation therefrom, taking into
	account certain considerations set forth in the Companies Law. The requirements for shareholder approval of any office holder
	compensation, and the relevant majority or special majority for such approval, are all as set forth in the Companies Law. Thus,
	we will seek shareholder approval for all corporate actions with respect to office holder compensation requiring such approval
	under the requirements of the Companies Law, including seeking prior approval of the shareholders for the compensation policy
	and for certain office holder compensation, rather than seeking approval for such corporate actions in accordance with NASDAQ

	&nbsp;We seek shareholder approval for all corporate actions requiring such approval in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Law, which are different from the shareholder approval requirements under the NASDAQ Listing Rules, including NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635. The NASDAQ Listing Rules require that we obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as for the establishment or amendment of certain equity-based compensation plans and arrangements, issuances that will result in a change of control of a company, certain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances of 20% or more of the shares or voting power in a company, and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company involving issuances of 20% or more of the shares or voting power in a company or if any director, officer or holder of 5% or more of the shares or voting power of the company has a 5% or greater interest in the company or assets to be acquired or consideration to be paid and the transaction could result in an increase in the outstanding common shares or voting power by 5% or more.

	Under the Companies Law, shareholder
	approval is required for any transaction, including any grant of equity-based compensation, to a director or a controlling shareholder,

	for a private placement that is deemed a &ldquo;extraordinary private placement&rdquo; or that involves a director or controlling
	shareholder. A &ldquo;extraordinary private placement&rdquo; is a private placement in which a company issues securities representing
	20% or more of its voting rights prior to the issuance and the consideration received pursuant to such issuance is not comprised,
	in whole or in part, solely of cash or securities registered for trade on an exchange or which is not made pursuant to market conditions,

	of which a person will become a holder of 5% of the shares or voting rights of the company or a controlling shareholder after the
	issuance. We will attempt to seek shareholder approval for our stock option or equity compensation plans (and the relevant annexes
	thereto) to the extent required in order to ensure they are tax qualified for any employees in the U.S. or who are U.S. citizens.
	However, even if such approval is not received, then the stock option or equity compensation plans will continue to be in effect,
	but the Company will be unable to grant options to its U.S. resident and/or citizen employees that qualify as Incentive Stock Options

	In December 2015, a lawsuit and a motion to approve such lawsuit as a class action was filed
	against the Company and its directors by shareholders who were holding the Company&rsquo;s Tel Aviv Stock Exchange listed securities before the
	offering mentioned in note 9C5, claiming damages for the purported class in the motion totaling NIS 16.4 million (USD 4.2
	million) due to the said offering. The Company&rsquo;s management rejects the claims and, in consultation with its legal
	advisors, believes that the likelihood of the Company not incurring any financial obligation as a result of this class action
	exceeds the likelihood that the Company will incur a financial obligation. Therefore, no provision for this

	KITOV respects the right of members

	contribution or political activity should be reviewed and approved by KITOV&rsquo;s General Counsel and/or the Audit Committee.
	Lobbying activity on behalf of the interests of our Company is permissible, but highly regulated by law. Regulators are to be treated
	in a professional manner and with respect. One must obtain approval from the General Council and/or the Audit Committee before:
	(i) lobbying or meeting with a government official, whether individually or as part of a group (e.g., a trade association); (ii)
	engaging a lobbyist at any level of government; or (iii) inviting a government official to a KITOV facility.
