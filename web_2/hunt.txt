	Hunter Maritime Acquisition

	similar business combination, vessels, vessel contracts (including contracts for the purchase and charter-in by us of vessels) or one or more operating businesses, which we intend to be in the international maritime shipping industry, which we refer

	This is an initial public offering of our securities. Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one
	Class A common share and one-half warrant.&nbsp;Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A common share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. Only whole warrants are
	exercisable. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and 12 months from the closing of this offering, and will expire five years after the completion of our initial
	business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation, as described in this prospectus. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. We have also granted the underwriters a 45-day
	option to purchase up to an additional 2,250,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any.

	We will provide our public shareholders with the

	as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including investment earnings (which investment earnings shall be net of taxes payable and any amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements)
	divided by the number of then outstanding Class A common shares that were sold as part of the units in this offering, which we refer to collectively as our public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. If we are unable to complete our
	initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, we will redeem 100% of the public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (defined herein)
	including investment earnings (less up to $100,000 of investment earnings to pay dissolution expenses and which investment earnings shall be net of taxes payable and any amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements) divided by the

	Our sponsor, Bocimar Hunter NV (which we

	the aggregate, or approximately $5,450,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. We refer to these warrants throughout this prospectus as the

	Prior to this offering, our sponsor purchased 4,312,500 Class B common shares (up to 562,500 of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to
	which the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised). The Class B common shares will automatically convert into Class A common shares at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as
	provided herein. In the case that additional Class A common shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing of the initial business combination, the
	ratio at which Class B common shares shall convert into Class A common shares will be adjusted so that the number of Class A common shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B common shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis,
	20% of the total number of all common shares outstanding upon completion of this offering plus all Class A common shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination, excluding any shares or
	equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination or pursuant to warrants issued to our sponsor, after taking into account any Class A common shares redeemed in connection with the initial business
	combination. Holders of the Class B common shares will have the right to elect all of our directors prior to our initial business combination. On any other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, holders of the Class B common shares and
	holders of the Class A common shares will vote together as a single class, except as required by law.

	Currently, there is no public market for

	securities will be approved for listing on NASDAQ.&nbsp;The Class A common shares and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus unless Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC informs us of
	its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our submission of a Form 6-K to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, containing an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds of this offering and
	the private placement and issuing a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once such separate trading begins, we anticipate that the Class A common shares and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols

	We are incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands as a corporation. Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended
	and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act, or the BCA.&nbsp;We will also be subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The Marshall Islands has a less
	developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides protections for investors to a lesser extent.

	All of our
	directors and officers are residents of countries other than the United States. Substantially all of our assets and a substantial portion of the assets of our directors and officers are located outside the United&nbsp;States. As a result, it may be
	difficult or impossible for United States investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors or officers or to realize against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments
	predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United&nbsp;States or any state in the United States. The Trust Company of the Marshall Islands, Inc., Trust Company Complex, Ajeltake Island, Ajeltake Road, Majuro,
	Marshall Islands MH96960, as our registered agent, can accept service of process on our behalf in any such action.

	combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.&nbsp;At or promptly following the completion of our initial business combination,
	we will use our best efforts to transfer our corporate domicile from the Marshall Islands to Belgium, which requires our shareholders&#146; approval under Belgian law and compliance with other applicable legal requirements. We have agreed with our
	sponsor, among other things, not to complete the initial business combination if we are unable to obtain such shareholder approval, subject to waiver by our sponsor in its sole discretion. Our sponsor and members of our management team have agreed

	Group, in 1991.&nbsp;The Saverys family remains CMB Group&#146;s majority shareholder. The CMB Group is a successor to companies that had a strong presence in the shipping industry, dating back to its formation in 1895 under the name Compagnie Belge

	Newcastlemax (approximately 207,000 dwt). Delphis NV, or Delphis, is CMB Group&#146;s containership division and controls 29 container vessels between 1,400 and 5,100 TEU. Delphis is one of the world&#146;s largest ice-classed containership owners,
	with 15 owned vessels with an aggregate carrying capacity of 40,000 TEU. CMB Group is also active in the chemical tanker business through Bochem, which owns and operates nine chemical tankers. CMB Group&#146;s major non-shipping related investment
	is in aviation through its subsidiary ASL Aviation Group of Dublin, Ireland, or ASL, which owns and operates a fleet of approximately 100 cargo and passenger aircraft. Since ASL was acquired from CMB Group in 2007, it has pursued an active growth
	strategy. ASL&#146;s most recent acquisitions are TNT Airways and Farnair.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that the shipping industry, and particularly the drybulk sector of the shipping industry, presents attractive opportunities for
	consolidation and growth and a favorable area in which to consummate a business combination transaction.&nbsp;We believe that many existing shipowners are unable to take advantage of the distressed nature of the shipping industry and related low
	asset values that emerged during 2009 and are continuing, as a result of difficulty in obtaining financing from traditional funding sources and challenges with their existing fleet (for example, high leverage and restrictions on doing business by
	their banks).&nbsp;In addition, the prevailing share prices of many publicly traded shipping companies are at prices below their net asset values, making it difficult for such companies to raise money in the capital markets or use their stock as
	currency for acquisitions.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our executive officers and directors have extensive experience in the shipping and transportation industries
	as managers, principals or directors of major worldwide shipping companies, where they have sourced, negotiated and structured transactions. We believe that the skills and experience of our management team will be crucial to consummating a
	successful business combination. Our executive officers and directors have been involved in the sale and purchase of approximately five hundred vessels throughout their careers, and have built and currently maintain extensive networks of
	relationships with some of the world&#146;s most highly regarded vessel charterers, including major oil and gas companies, mining companies and steel companies.&nbsp;We plan to apply those skills and experience to identify and generate vessel
	acquisition opportunities, which may include purchasing vessels and acquiring vessels by chartering them into our fleet from their owners. These relationships also include, among other sources, executives and board members at public and private
	companies, private equity and venture capital firms, banks, financial and legal consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, brokers and accountants.

	While we do not have any contractual arrangement with CMB Group to assist us in identifying and analyzing potential target assets and

	NASDAQ rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value
	equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our

	industry with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We may also raise additional funds that we may use in connection with our initial business combination, including through credit facilities, equity offerings, debt offerings or other public

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our
	public shareholders own shares will own or acquire vessels and/or 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction
	company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction
	company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company
	Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority
	interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all
	of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial
	business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the
	post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair
	market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the assets and target businesses that are acquired by us as part of our initial business combination.

	We intend to consummate our initial business combination and conduct the redemptions without seeking shareholder approval and instead redeem
	the shares held by our shareholders pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC. The tender
	offer documents will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
	Regardless of whether we are required by law or NASDAQ rules to seek shareholder approval, or we decide to seek shareholder approval for other business or legal reasons, so long as we maintain our status as a foreign private issuer, or FPI, and are
	required to comply with the FPI rules, we will conduct the redemptions pursuant to U.S. tender offer rules. If we are no longer deemed a FPI (and no longer required to comply with the FPI rules) and we are required by law or NASDAQ rules to seek
	shareholder approval, or we decide to seek shareholder approval for other business or legal reasons, we may conduct the redemptions in a manner similar to many non-FPI blank check companies in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the
	proxy rules and not pursuant to U.S. tender offer rules.

	On July 11, 2016, we issued to our sponsor an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for

	contributed to us by the number of founder shares issued. Up to 562,500 founder shares will be subject to forfeiture by our initial shareholders (or their permitted transferees) on a pro rata basis depending on the extent to which the

	the size of the offering under the Securities Act, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital, as applicable, with respect to our Class B common shares immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount

	We may seek

	we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be
	less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#146;s &#147;penny stock&#148; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination.
	Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing
	condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant
	to enter into a business combination transaction with us.

	addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising
	additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business

	The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or
	preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as &#147;covered securities.&#148; Because we expect that our units and eventually our Class A common shares and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ, our units,
	Class A common shares and warrants will qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a
	suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the
	sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of
	securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on NASDAQ, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our
	securities.

	to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or
	arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the
	prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10
	years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.00 per public share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to a letter
	agreement, the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or
	products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of&nbsp;(i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per
	share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the investment earnings which may be withdrawn to pay taxes
	and working capital expenses.&nbsp;This liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters
	of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of
	any liability for such third party claims. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe
	that our sponsor&#146;s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties
	including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be
	reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares.

	own 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not
	support, including amendments to our amended and restated articles of incorporation. If our initial shareholders purchase any units in this offering or if our initial shareholders purchase any additional common shares in the aftermarket or in
	privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control. Neither our initial shareholders nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any current intention to purchase additional securities, other than as disclosed in
	this prospectus. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our common shares. In addition, our board of directors will be divided into three classes, with only
	one class of directors being elected in each year and each class serving a three-year term. We may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of
	the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our &#147;staggered&#148; board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will
	be considered for election and our initial shareholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial shareholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion

	The difference between the
	public offering price per share (allocating all of the unit purchase price to the Class A common share and none to the warrant included in the unit) and the pro forma net tangible book value per Class A common share after this offering constitutes
	the dilution to you and the other investors in this offering. Our sponsor acquired the founder shares at a nominal price, significantly contributing to this dilution. Upon closing of this offering, and assuming no value is ascribed to the warrants
	included in the units, you and the other public shareholders will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately 89% (or $8.93 per share, assuming no exercise of the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option), the difference between the
	pro forma net tangible book value per share of&nbsp;$1.07 and the initial offering price of&nbsp; $10.00 per unit. This dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B common shares result in the issuance of
	Class A common shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B common shares at the time of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public shareholders seek redemptions from the trust
	for their public shares. In addition, because of the anti-dilution protection in the founder shares, any equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our Class
	A common shares.

	A significant contraction in demand for imported commodities as a result of economic downturns or
	changes in government policies in certain regional markets could further depress vessel freight rates, as well as the general demand for vessels and therefore the value of such vessels. The demand for vessels is also greatly affected by, among other
	factors, the demand for consumer goods, commodities and bagged and finished products, as well as commodity prices, environmental concerns and competition. The supply of shipping capacity is also a function of the delivery of new vessels and the
	number of older vessels scrapped, in lay-up, converted to other uses, reactivated or removed from active service. Supply may also be affected by maritime transportation and other types of governmental regulation, including that of international
	authorities. These and other factors may cause a decrease in the demand for the services we may ultimately provide or the value of the vessels we may own and operate, thereby limiting our ability to successfully operate any prospective target
	business with which we may ultimately consummate our initial business combination.

	The shipping industry has historically
	exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, in charter hire rates. This seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results. For example, the tanker market is typically stronger in the fall and winter
	months in anticipation of increased consumption of oil, coal and other raw materials in the northern hemisphere. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. As a
	result, revenues from the tanker market are typically weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30 and September 30, and, conversely, typically stronger in fiscal quarters ended December&nbsp;31 and March 31. Our operating results,

	accidental losses, vessel capacity will increase. If the supply of vessel capacity increases and if the demand for vessel capacity decreases or does not increase correspondingly, charter rates could materially decline. A reduction in charter rates

	Fuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in shipping operations when vessels are not under period charter. Changes in the price of

	dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future. However, if we increase the size of this offering under the Securities Act, we may effect a stock dividend with respect to our Class B common shares immediately prior to the consummation of
	this offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial shareholders, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of our issued and outstanding common shares upon the consummation of this offering. The payment of dividends, if any, after our

	The difference between the public offering price per Class A common share, assuming no value, is attributed to the warrants included in the
	units we are offering pursuant to this prospectus or the private placement warrants, and the pro forma net tangible book value per Class A common share after this offering, assuming all Class B common shares converted into Class A common shares on a
	one-for-one basis, constitutes the dilution to investors in this offering. Such calculation does not reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of warrants, including the private placement warrants, which would cause the actual
	dilution to the public shareholders to be higher, particularly where a cashless exercise is utilized. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities
	(including the value of Class A common shares which may be redeemed for cash), by the number of outstanding Class A common shares.

	At
	July 12, 2016, our net tangible book value was $6,092, or $0.001 per common share. After giving effect to the sale of 15,000,000 Class A common shares included in the units we are offering by this prospectus, the sale of the private placement
	warrants and the deduction of underwriting commissions and estimated expenses of this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value at July 12, 2016 would have been $5,000,001, or $1.07 per share, representing an immediate increase in net tangible
	book value (as decreased by the value of the approximately 14,077,500 Class A common shares that may be redeemed for cash and assuming no exercise of the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option) of&nbsp; $11.07 per share to our initial shareholders
	as of the date of this prospectus and an immediate dilution to public shareholders from this offering of&nbsp; $10.00 per share. Total dilution to public shareholders from this offering will be $8.93 per share (or $9.05 if the underwriters&#146;

	As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, at July 12, 2016, we had approximately
	$25,000 in cash, which was held in escrow for our benefit by our legal counsel (restricted cash as of July 12, 2016) pending the opening of our bank account, and which was subsequently released to us, and current liabilities of $18,908. Further, we
	expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. These factors, among others, raise
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

	We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational
	activities and those necessary to prepare for this offering. Following this offering, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of
	investment earnings on cash and cash equivalents after this offering. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. After
	this offering, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses to increase substantially
	after the closing of this offering.

	Our liquidity needs have been satisfied to date through receipt of $25,000 from the sale of the founder shares to our sponsor. We estimate that
	the net proceeds from (i) the sale of the units in this offering, after deducting offering expenses of approximately $1,000,000, underwriting commissions of $3,000,000 ($3,450,000 if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full)
	(excluding deferred underwriting commissions of $5,250,000 (or up to $6,037,500 if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full)), and (ii) the sale of the private placement warrants for a purchase price of $5,000,000 (or
	$5,450,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be $151,000,000 (or $173,500,000 if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full). $150,000,000 (or $172,500,000 if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option
	is exercised in full) will initially be held in the trust account, which includes $5,250,000 (or up to $6,037,500 if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions. The remaining approximately
	$1,000,000 will not be held in the trust account. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,000,000, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be
	held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase
	by a corresponding amount.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing
	investment earnings earned on the trust account (which investment earnings shall be net of taxes payable and working capital released to us and excluding deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may
	withdraw investment earnings to pay taxes and working capital expenses. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the
	trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

	Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we will have available to us the approximately $1,000,000 of proceeds held
	outside the trust account. We will use these funds primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
	target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, and to pay taxes to the extent the investment
	earnings earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our taxes.

	In order to fund working capital deficiencies, if any, or finance transaction costs in connection
	with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor, or an affiliate thereof, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would
	repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be
	used for such repayment. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement

	We expect
	our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $300,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations;
	$100,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; $55,000 for NASDAQ and other regulatory fees; $240,000 for office space, secretarial support and administrative services; and approximately $305,000 for general

	These amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our
	actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a
	&#147;no-shop&#148; provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from &#147;shopping&#148; around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business
	combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a
	&#147;no-shop&#148; provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result
	in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses.

	We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our
	business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds
	available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares
	upon completion of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing
	simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the current economic environment, it has become especially difficult to obtain acquisition financing. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not
	have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in
	order to meet our obligations.

	Management, however, is not exempt from this requirement and will be required to, among other things, maintain and periodically evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we will

	Introduction
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a newly organized
	blank check company incorporated on June 24, 2016 as a Marshall Islands corporation formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, debt acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar
	business combination, vessels, vessel contracts (including contracts for the purchase and charter-in by us of vessels) or one or more operating businesses, which we intend to be in the international maritime shipping industry. We have not selected
	any potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target.

	Business Opportunity and Strategy
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our
	business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination to form an owner and operator of shipping vessels, which would form a platform on which to expand and build a formidable player within the sector of the shipping industry
	in which those vessels are concentrated. We believe that the shipping industry, and particularly the drybulk sector of the shipping industry, presents attractive opportunities for consolidation and growth and a favorable area in which to consummate
	a business combination transaction.&nbsp;We believe that many existing shipowners are unable to take advantage of the distressed nature of the shipping industry and related low asset values that emerged during 2009 and are continuing, as a result of
	difficulty in obtaining financing from traditional funding sources and challenges with their existing fleet (for example, high leverage and restrictions on doing business by their banks).&nbsp;In addition, the prevailing share prices of many
	publicly traded shipping companies are at prices below their net asset values, making it difficult for such companies to raise money in the capital markets or use their stock as currency for acquisitions. While we may pursue one or more acquisition
	opportunities in various sectors of the shipping industry, in the event that we find opportunities in one or more different sectors that are more compelling than other sectors, including unrelated to the shipping industry, we would pursue those
	opportunities.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our executive officers and directors have extensive experience in the shipping and transportation industries as managers,
	principals or directors of major worldwide shipping companies, where they have sourced, negotiated and structured transactions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	believe that the skills and experience of our management team will be crucial to consummating a successful business combination. Our executive officers and directors have been involved in the sale and purchase of approximately five hundred vessels
	throughout their careers, and have built and currently maintain extensive networks of relationships with some of the world&#146;s most highly regarded vessel charterers, including major oil and gas companies, mining companies and steel
	companies.&nbsp;We plan to apply those skills and experience to identify and generate vessel acquisition opportunities, which may include purchasing vessels and acquiring vessels by chartering them into our fleet from their owners.&nbsp;These
	relationships also include, among other sources, executives and board members at public and private companies, private equity and venture capital firms, banks, financial and legal consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, brokers and accountants.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While we do not have any contractual arrangement with CMB Group to assist us in identifying and analyzing potential target assets and
	businesses, we expect to have access to some of its resources, such as financial and accounting personnel who will serve us under an administrative services agreement, which may assist us in evaluating these targets.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our executive officers currently intend, but are not required, to stay involved in our management following our initial business combination.
	The roles that they will fulfill will depend on the type of business with which we combine and the specific skills and depth of the target&#146;s management. If one or more of our executive officers remain with us in a management role following our
	initial business combination, we may enter into employment or other compensation agreements with them, the terms of which have not been determined.

	combination. The ability of management to retain their positions with us may influence our management&#146;s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after

	Summary of the International Shipping Industry
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The shipping industry provides a practical and cost-effective means of transporting large volumes of cargoes. This is accomplished
	predominantly by the dry bulk and tanker sectors, while other related sectors tend to be specialized. The dry bulk sector involves the transportation of dry bulk and general cargoes, including, among other products, coal, minerals, ore, steel
	products, forest products, agricultural products, construction materials and heavy equipment, machinery and spare parts via dry bulk cargo vessels. The tanker sector involves the transportation of wet products such as crude oil, refined petroleum
	cargoes and liquid chemicals via different types of tankers. Related sectors comprise, but are not limited to, the operation of vessels such as containerships, liquefied gas carriers and offshore supply and anchor-handling vessels.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We may seek to acquire newbuilding or secondhand vessels, one or more companies with agreements to purchase newbuilding or secondhand vessels,
	one or more companies that already own or operate vessels, a number of such companies as a group or one or more entities that provides commercial management, operational and technical management or other services to one or more segments of the
	shipping industry. Prices for newbuilding and secondhand vessels vary widely depending on the type, quality, age and discounted future earnings. A potential target business might be a holding company, the sole assets of which are one or more
	agreements to acquire individual vessels. If we acquire such a company, we will need to retain current management, seek to retain new management or outsource the commercial and technical management of the vessels by contracting with a shipping
	company engaged in this business. Although it is not our current intention to do so, if we were to acquire secondhand vessels or one or more companies with agreements to purchase individual secondhand vessels, we would be subject to risks resulting
	from being a start-up shipping company, such as the inability to quickly develop the infrastructure and hire the seafarers and land-based administrative and management personnel necessary to effectively manage and operate the business. In addition,
	we might have to begin our operations without advance bookings of charters, which could lead such vessels initially to have a higher than industry standard number of idle days until such time as we establish business relations. Moreover, if we were
	to acquire vessels that are newbuildings or one or more companies with agreements to purchase newbuildings, we would likely have to wait a considerable period of time prior to the delivery to us of the newbuildings, during which time we will have no
	earnings. Finally, one or more of our vessels may require modifications or upgrades for us to place them in service. As such, we may own vessels that are not engaged in revenue producing activities for some time after we acquire them. Our inability
	to manage such risks could, in such event, impair our operations. See &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Associated with the Shipping Industry&#151;If we were to acquire vessels, a company that owns vessels or a company with agreements to purchase
	vessels, we may be subject to risks resulting from being a start-up shipping company.&#148;

	In addition, if we elected to purchase one or
	more individual vessels, financial information that we provide at any time, whether in connection with obtaining approval for our initial business combination, if required, or otherwise, will likely not contain historical financial information with
	respect to such vessels. Rather, such information would consist of the same information that would typically be provided by shipping industry issuers, such as: (i) historical and prevailing market rates for vessels on the basis of type, age and
	proposed employment;

	LNG carriers transport liquefied natural gas, or LNG, internationally between liquefaction facilities and import terminals. After natural gas
	is transported by pipeline from production fields to a liquefaction facility, it is supercooled to a temperature of approximately negative 162 degrees Celsius. This process reduces its volume to approximately 1/600th of its volume in a gaseous
	state. The reduced volume facilitates economical storage and transportation by vessels over long distances, enabling countries with limited natural gas reserves or limited access to long-distance transmission pipelines to meet their demand for
	natural gas. LNG carriers include a sophisticated containment system that holds and insulates the LNG so it maintains its liquid form. The LNG is transported overseas in specially built tanks on double-hulled ships to a receiving terminal, where it
	is offloaded and stored in heavily insulated tanks. In regasification facilities at the receiving terminal, the LNG is returned to its gaseous state (or regasified) and then shipped by pipeline for distribution to natural gas customers.

	The LNG market includes private and state-controlled energy and utilities companies that generally operate captive fleets and independent ship
	owners and operators. Many major energy companies compete directly with independent owners by transporting LNG for third parties in addition to transporting their own LNG. Given the complex, long-term nature of LNG projects, major energy companies
	historically have transported LNG through their captive fleets. However, independent fleet operators have been obtaining an increasing percentage of charters for new or expanded LNG projects as major energy companies have continued to divest their
	non-core businesses.

	February 2004. The BWM Convention&#146;s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory
	concentration limits. All ships will also have to carry a ballast water record book and an International Ballast Water Management Certificate. The BWM Convention enters into force 12 months after it has been adopted by 30 states, the combined
	merchant fleets of which represent not less than 35% of the gross tonnage of the world&#146;s merchant shipping. On September&nbsp;8, 2016, this threshold was met (with 52 contracting parties making up 35.14%). Thus, the BWM Convention will enter
	into force on September 8, 2017. Many of the implementation dates in the BWM Convention have already passed, so that once the BWM Convention enters into force, the period of installation of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements would be
	extremely short, with several thousand ships a year needing to install ballast water management systems (BWMS). For this reason, on December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention so that
	they are triggered by the entry into force date and not the dates originally in the BWM Convention. This, in effect, makes all vessels constructed before the entry into force date &#147;existing vessels&#148; and allows for the installation of a
	BWMS on such vessels at the first renewal survey following entry into force of the convention.&nbsp;Furthermore, in October 2014 the MEPC met and adopted additional resolutions concerning the BWM Convention&#146;s implementation. Once mid-ocean
	ballast exchange or ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers and the costs of ballast water treatments may be material.&nbsp;However, many countries already regulate the
	discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such discharges.&nbsp;The United States for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to
	conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements.

	damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The 1992 Protocol changed certain limits on liability, expressed using the International Monetary Fund

	We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares

	100% of such interests or assets in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more
	of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the
	Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction
	company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock
	of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less
	than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of
	such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the

	If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
	combination pursuant to U.S. tender offer rules, our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in
	concert or as a &#147;group&#148; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in this offering, without our prior consent. We
	believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase
	their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise
	its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder&#146;s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders&#146;
	ability to redeem to no more than 20% of the shares sold in this offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly
	in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders&#146; ability to vote all of their
	shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 20% of the shares sold in this offering) for or against our initial business combination.

	in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company&#146;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#146;s option. The tender offer or
	proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have
	from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to
	seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.

	There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them
	through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred
	regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be
	effectuated.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in
	connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders&#146; vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and
	check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her
	certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an &#147;option window&#148; after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&#146;s shares in the market. If the
	price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they
	needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become &#147;option&#148; rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic
	delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder&#146;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date
	of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable
	date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to
	redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Ocean-going vessels represent the most efficient and often the only means of transporting large volumes of basic commodities and finished
	products over long distances. In general, the supply of and demand for seaborne transportation capacity are the primary drivers of charter rates and values for all vessels.&nbsp;Larger vessels exhibit higher charter rate and vessel value volatility
	compared with smaller vessels, due to the larger volume of cargo shipped on board, their reliance on a few key commodities, and long-haul routes among a small number of ports. Vessel values primarily reflect prevailing and expected future charter
	rates, and are also influenced by factors such as the age of the vessel, the shipyard of its construction and its specifications. During extended periods of high charter rates, vessel values tend to appreciate, while during periods when rates are in
	decline, vessel values also tend to fall.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Historically, the relationship between incremental supply and demand has varied among different
	sectors of shipping, meaning that at any one time different sectors of the seaborne transportation industry may be at differing stages of their respective supply and demand cycle, as the drivers of demand in each sector are different and are not
	always subject to the same factors.&nbsp;This is the case in 2016, as there is clear evidence to suggest that dry bulk carriers, oil tankers and container vessels are at different stages in the normal freight market/asset price cycle, as indicated
	in the chart below.

	Over 90% of world trade by volume terms is transported by sea and with the exception of 2009
	global seaborne trade has grown in every year in the last three decades. World seaborne trade increased at a compound average growth rate, or CAGR, of 3.8% between 2000 and 2015 to reach 10.4 billion tons. Seaborne cargo is broadly categorized as
	either liquid or dry cargo. Dry cargo includes drybulk cargo and other dry cargo which can either be containerised or transported in break-bulk form.&nbsp;Liquid cargo includes crude oil, refined petroleum products, vegetable oils, gases and
	chemicals. The following table presents the breakdown of global seaborne trade by the three main types of cargo between 1980 and 2015.

	The supply of dry bulk shipping capacity is determined by the size of the existing worldwide dry bulk fleet, the number of new vessels on
	order, the scrapping of older vessels and the number of vessels out of active service (for example, vessels that are laid up or otherwise not available for hire). As of October&nbsp;31, 2016 the global fleet of dry bulk carriers consisted of 10,814
	vessels, totaling 789 million dwt in capacity.

	The increase in the dry bulk fleet was the highest during the period from 2010 to 2012, with average per annum fleet growth during the
	three-year period being close to 14%. In 2016, the dry bulk fleet is expected to grow by 1.2% due to high rates of demolition and low deliveries of new tonnage.

	Future supply of dry bulk carriers depends on delivery of new vessels from the orderbook and the
	removal of vessels from the global fleet, primarily through scrapping. As of October&nbsp;31, 2016, the global dry bulk orderbook (excluding options) amounted to 100.6 million dwt, or 12.8% of the existing dry bulk fleet.&nbsp;By recent standards
	(since 2000) the ratio of the July 2016 orderbook to the existing fleet is quite low. At its most recent peak in 2008, the orderbook was equivalent to 70% of the existing fleet.&nbsp;However, it has since declined steadily as a result of reduced
	levels of new ordering and ships being delivered from the orderbook.

	Between 2004 and 2007, slippage rates tended to be less than 10%, which means that 10% of the vessels due to be delivered in any year are in
	fact delivered in subsequent years.&nbsp;In the dry bulk sector, the evidence suggests that the slippage rate was slightly less than 20% in 2008, but has since increased considerably. For example, in 2015, actual deliveries were close to 33 million
	dwt, against scheduled deliveries of 76 million dwt, equivalent to a slippage rate of 56%. In 2016 the situation is expected to be similar, with shipowners delaying the delivery of vessels due to low freight rates and the absence of funding.

	Apart from owners delaying the delivery of new tonnage, slippage is also a manifestation of the
	combined effects of (i) shipyards initially quoting unrealistic delivery times, (ii) inexperience among new shipbuilders, and (iii) financing problems associated with both shipowners securing finance and new shipyards obtaining development
	capital.&nbsp;In the current market global banks are skeptical about new lending to the shipping community, plus abysmal freight rates have led to restricted ordering activity by shipowners.&nbsp;Finally, shipbuilders have also started to shut down
	because of lack of business and inability to raise funds for building new ships.

	Future supply will also be affected by the level of removals from the fleet. At one level
	scrapping activity is a function of the age profile of the fleet, as all vessels have finite lives.&nbsp;However, the single biggest influence on the decision to scrap is the prevailing level of freight rates and the perceived market outlook. Strong
	freight rates encourage further trading, which minimizes tonnage offered to breakers.&nbsp;The converse applies, so when freight markets weaken, scrapping will normally increase.&nbsp;As a result of sluggish freight markets, there has been a marked
	increase in scrapping activity.

	Dry bulk carriers play an important role in connecting points of resource extraction, such as mines and farms, with end users, such as steel
	mills and food processors.&nbsp;Due to the increasingly global supply chain and changing demand patterns for different raw materials, dry bulk carriers provide the most cost effective means of completing the supply chain than other methods such as
	air, rail, or truck transportation.&nbsp;Dry bulk trade is influenced by the underlying demand for the dry bulk commodities which, in turn, is influenced by the level of worldwide economic activity. Generally, growth in gross domestic product, or
	GDP, and industrial production correlate with peaks in demand for marine dry bulk transportation services.

	. A voyage charter involves the carriage of a specific amount and type of cargo on a load port-to-discharge port basis, subject to various cargo handling terms. Most of these charters are of
	a single voyage nature, as trading patterns do not encourage round voyage trading. The owner of the vessel receives one payment derived by multiplying the tonnage of cargo loaded on board by the agreed upon freight rate expressed on a U.S.
	dollar-per-ton basis. The owner is responsible for the payment of all voyage and operating expenses, as well as the capital costs of the vessel.

	concluded as well as daily assessments provided to the exchange by a panel of independent shipbrokers) for the major bulk vessel trading routes. These indices include the Baltic Panamax Index, or BPI, the index with the longest history and, more

	The dramatic increase in newbuilding prices and the strength of the charter market have also affected values in the secondhand market, to the
	extent that prices for dry bulk vessels rose sharply from 2004 reaching a peak in mid-2008. With vessel earnings running at relatively high levels and a limited availability of newbuilding berths, the ability to deliver a vessel early has resulted
	in increases in secondhand prices, especially for modern tonnage. Consequently, secondhand prices of modern dry bulk vessels in 2008 reached higher levels than those of comparably sized newbuildings.

	Crude oil is transported in uncoated vessels, which range upwards in size from 55,000 dwt.&nbsp;Products are carried in coated and un-coated
	ships and include commodities such as fuel oil and vacuum gas oil (often referred to as &#147;dirty products&#148;), gas oil, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene and naphtha (often referred to as &#147;clean products&#148;). In addition, some product
	tankers are also able to carry bulk liquid chemicals and edible oils and fats if they have the appropriate International Maritime Organization (IMO) certification. These vessels are classified as product/chemical tankers, and as such, they represent
	a swing element in supply. They have the ability to move between product and edible oil, chemical trades depending on market conditions.&nbsp;Clean petroleum products are therefore carried by non-IMO product tankers and IMO certified
	product/chemical tankers. IMO tankers will also carry, depending on their tank coatings, a range of other products including organic and inorganic bulk liquid chemicals, vegetable oils, animal fats and special products such as molasses.

	As of October&nbsp;31, 2016 the total oil tanker fleet (crude and products tankers) consisted of 3,366 ships with a combined capacity of 453.5

	New ordering of tankers picked up in late 2014 and 2015 because of the continued strength in the
	tanker freight market on account of tight supply demand dynamics and shipowners seeking exemptions from compliance to tier III nitrogen-oxide (NOx) emission norms for vessels ordered before January 1, 2016. As a result, the tanker orderbook surged
	by 68.4% from 47.6 million dwt in December 2013 to 80.2 million dwt in December 2015.

	Demand for oil traded by sea is principally affected by world and regional economic conditions, as well as other factors such as changes in the
	location of productive capacity and variations in regional prices. Demand for shipping capacity is a product of the physical quantity of the cargo (measured depending on the cargo in terms of tons or cubic metrics) together with the distance the
	cargo is carried. Demand cycles move broadly in line with developments in the global economy, with demand for products slowing significantly in the period immediately after the onset of the global economic downturn in late 2008, before recovering
	gradually from 2011 onwards with the general improvement in the economic climate. Provisional data for 2015 suggests that world oil demand was 94.5 million barrels per day (mpbd), an increase of 1.8% in 2014.&nbsp;Between 2005 and 2015, world oil
	demand grew by a CAGR of 1.2%.

	Tanker charter hire rates and vessel values for all tankers are influenced by the supply and demand for tanker capacity. Also, in general
	terms, time charter rates are less volatile than spot rates, because they reflect the fact that the vessel is fixed for a longer period of time. In the spot market, rates will reflect the immediate underlying conditions in vessel supply and demand
	and are thus prone to more volatility. The trend in spot rates since 2005 for the main tanker classes is shown in the chart below.

	Tanker newbuilding prices increased significantly between 2003 and 2007 primarily as a result of increased tanker demand. Thereafter prices
	weakened in the face of a poor freight market and lower levels of new ordering. In late 2013, prices started to recover and they continued to edge up slowly during 2014 before falling by a small amount in late 2015/early 2016. For most oil tanker
	sizes, newbuilding prices are still below the peaks reported at the height of the market boom in 2008 and also below long-term averages.

	Containerships are typically &#147;cellular,&#148; which means they are equipped with metal guide rails to allow for rapid loading
	and unloading and provide for more secure carriage. In some cases, smaller containerships will be equipped with their own cranes for loading and unloading. These ships are often referred to as &#147;geared&#148; ships. The larger ships, typically
	over 3,000 TEU, are virtually all &#147;gearless.&#148;&nbsp;There are no industry-accepted definitions of the container fleet, but Drewry classifies the fleet by the following main categories.

	A significant proportion of the ships of 10,000 TEU capacity and above on the current orderbook
	has been driven by container liner companies seeking larger vessels to minimize average costs per TEU slot.&nbsp;Container liner companies have continued to maximize economies of scale by deploying large TEU capacity and more fuel-efficient vessels
	which benefit from lower fuel consumption, operating expense benefits and other costs per TEU of capacity. Furthermore, modern designs, including wide-beam designs, can provide increased homogenous TEU capacity per nominal intake compared to older
	vessels of a similar nominal TEU capacity, providing further unit cost advantages. As such, container liner operators have maintained an interest in larger vessels, despite a significant fall in the cost of fuel since the second half of 2014.

	The main factors affecting charter rates are primarily supply and demand for container shipping. Charters can be on a spot, short-term or
	long-term basis. The shorter the charter period, the greater the charter rate is affected by the current supply/demand balance and by the current phase of the market cycle. For longer charter periods, from three years to ten years, charter rates
	tend to be more stable and less cyclical. Other factors affecting charter rates include the age and characteristics of the ships (including fuel consumption, speed, new design, whether geared or gearless) and supply demand dynamics.

	Pricing of containership transportation services occurs against a background of a highly competitive global containership charter market.
	Containership charter hire rates depend on the supply of, and demand for, containership capacity, and can vary significantly from year to year. Containership economies of scale mean that the daily time charter hire rate per TEU for a larger
	containership is less than for a ship with lower TEU capacity.

	The onset of the global economic downturn and the resulting slowdown in container trade growth
	created a relative oversupply of capacity, leading to a rapid decrease in containership earnings in the latter half of 2008, which continued in the first half of 2009, with earnings remaining depressed during the rest of the year. In 2010,
	containership charter hire rates registered an upward trend over the year as a whole and made further gains in early 2011 before decreasing sharply in the second half of 2011 and remaining depressed through 2012, 2013 and 2014. There was a small

	As the containership charter market plays an increasingly important role in the container shipping industry, the market for the sale and
	purchase of secondhand containerships has also expanded. Secondhand vessel prices are influenced by newbuilding prices and also by vessel charter hire rates or earnings, although there is sometimes a lag in the relationship.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Activity on the secondhand market for containerships has grown steadily in recent years. A portion of this activity has been constituted by
	the sale of containerships by container liner companies to tonnage providers. These sales have commonly been accompanied by &#147;time charter back&#148; arrangements whereby the container liner company sells the vessel, removing the asset from its
	balance sheet, then, as part of the transaction, arranges a time charter of the vessel from the party to which it has sold the ship. The liquidity of the secondhand sales market is much greater for small and medium-sized containerships than for
	large vessels.

	The BCA authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of
	directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for certain breaches of directors&#146; fiduciary duties. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a provision that eliminates
	the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the
	fullest extent authorized by law, and further, that we may advance expenses incurred while defending a civil or criminal proceeding. The foregoing obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or
	damage awards against our officers and directors, which we may be unable to recoup.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our amended and restated bylaws further permit

	officers&#146; liability insurance that insures our directors and officers against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify the directors and officers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These provisions and resultant costs may discourage us and our shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers and directors for
	breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our officers and directors even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders.
	Furthermore, a shareholder&#146;s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.&nbsp;We believe that these provisions,
	the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced directors and officers.

	Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and by the BCA. The
	provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States, including Delaware. While the BCA also provides that it is to be interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware and other
	states with substantially similar legislative provisions, there have been few, if any, court cases interpreting the BCA in the Marshall Islands, and we cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as Delaware or
	other courts in the United States. Accordingly, you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests under Marshall Islands law in the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a
	corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction that has developed a substantial body of case law. The following table provides a comparison between statutory provisions of the BCA and the Delaware General Corporation Law relating to

	At or promptly following the completion of our initial business combination, we will use our best efforts to transfer our corporate domicile
	from the Marshall Islands to Belgium, which requires our shareholders&#146; approval under Belgian law and compliance with other applicable legal requirements.&nbsp;Upon effectiveness of any such redomiciliation to Belgium, our corporate affairs
	would be governed by our new articles of association and by the Belgian Companies Code. You should be aware that the Belgian Companies Code differs in certain material respects from the laws generally applicable to U.S. companies incorporated in the
	State of Delaware. Accordingly, you may have more difficulty protecting your interests under Belgian law in the face of actions by management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a United
	States jurisdiction, such as the State of Delaware. From a Belgian corporate law point of view, should we transfer our corporate domicile to Belgium, we would qualify as a public company (

	een vennootschap die een openbaar beroep op het spaarwezen
	heeft gedaan / une soci&eacute;t&eacute; ayant fait publiquement appel &agrave; l&#146;&eacute;pargne

	), but not as a listed company (genoteerde vennootschap / soci&eacute;t&eacute; cot&eacute;e) because none of our securities are listed on any
	regulated market in the European Economic Area. The Belgian corporate law provisions that are applicable to Belgian listed companies do therefore not apply to us. Furthermore, we are not subject to most of the disclosure obligations applicable to
	Belgian listed companies. The following table provides a comparison between the statutory provisions of the Belgian Companies Code and the Delaware General Corporation Law relating to shareholders&#146; rights.

	Any dividends or other distributions we make,
	following the transfer of our corporate domicile to Belgium, to shareholders will, in principle, be subject to withholding tax in Belgium at a rate of 27% (30% as of January&nbsp;1, 2017), except for shareholders which qualify for an exemption of

	a lower withholding tax rate or an exemption by virtue of a tax treaty. Various conditions may apply and shareholders residing in countries other than Belgium are advised to consult their advisers regarding the tax consequences of dividends or other
	distributions made by us. Our shareholders residing in countries other than Belgium may not be able to credit the amount of such withholding tax to any tax due on such dividends or other distributions in any other country than Belgium. As a result,

	Belgium and the United States
	have concluded a tax treaty concerning the avoidance of double taxation, which we refer to as the U.S.-Belgium Treaty. The U.S.-Belgium Treaty generally reduces the applicability of Belgian withholding tax on dividends to 15%, 5% or 0% of the gross
	amount of the dividends paid to U.S. taxpayers, provided that the U.S. taxpayer meets certain limitation of benefits conditions imposed by the U.S.-Belgium Treaty. The 5% withholding tax applies in case where the U.S. shareholder is a company which
	owns directly at least 10% of our voting stock. A 0% Belgian withholding tax applies when the shareholder is a company which has owned directly at least 10% of our share capital for a 12-month period ending on the date the dividend is declared, or
	is, subject to certain conditions, a U.S. pension fund. A 15% Belgian withholding tax generally applies in all other cases. All U.S. shareholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisers to determine whether they can invoke the benefits and
	meet the limitation of benefits conditions as imposed by the U.S.-Belgium Treaty.

	Belgian withholding tax provided that the shares held by the non-resident company, upon payment or attribution of the dividends, amount to at least 10% of our share capital and are held or will be held during an uninterrupted period of at least one

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Speculation Tax is applicable on shares (as well as other qualifying financial instruments) listed on a Belgian or foreign-regulated
	market (pursuant Art. 2, 1st ind., 3&deg; of the Law of August 2, 2002), or a multilateral trading facility (pursuant Art. 2, 1st ind., 4&deg; of the Law of August 2, 2002) (provided there is at least one daily transaction and a central order book),

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The taxable base of the Speculation Tax is equal to the difference between (i) the price received when disposing of the Shares (in whatever
	form), reduced with the levied Belgian tax on stock exchange transactions (see &#147;Belgian Tax on Stock Exchange Transactions&#148; below) borne by the taxpayer on the transfer; and (ii) the acquisition price paid by the taxpayer (or the donor in
	case of a gift) increased with the Belgian tax on stock exchange transactions borne by the taxpayer (or donor) upon the acquisition of the shares. If the acquisition price is unknown, the withholding tax is applied on the full price received for the

	was acquired by the shareholder is also deemed to be the first share that is sold. The six month period is calculated per share with an identical ISIN-code. In case of short-selling the six month period is calculated by looking at the time elapsed

	The Speculation Tax is levied by the

	to be declared in the personal income tax return of the shareholder/taxpayer. Resident individuals who have a foreign custody account and who realize the capital gains without the intervention of a Belgian based intermediary have to declare the

	In the opinion of Seward &amp; Kissel LLP, our United States counsel, the following discussion summarizes certain United States federal income
	tax consequences to us based on our proposed activities and to our U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders, each as defined below, of the ownership and disposition of our Class A common shares and units. The following discussion of United States federal
	income tax matters is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements, and existing and proposed regulations issued by the United States
	Department of the Treasury, which we refer to as the Treasury Regulations, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussion below is based, in part, on the description of our proposed business as described herein
	and assumes that we conduct our proposed business as described herein. Unless otherwise noted, references in the following discussion to the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we&#148; and &#147;us&#148; are to Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. and its
	subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (and, with respect to the taxation of our Company following an initial business combination, the entity resulting from the initial business combination and its subsidiaries).

	No statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for United
	States federal income tax purposes, and therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. The acquisition of a unit should be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of our Class A common shares and
	one-half of one warrant, a whole one of which is exercisable to acquire one share of our Class A common shares. We intend to treat the acquisition of a unit in this manner and, by purchasing a unit, you will agree to adopt such treatment for tax
	purposes. For United States federal income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one Class A common share and the one-half of one warrant based on the relative fair market
	value of each at the time of issuance. The price allocated to each Class A common share and one-half of one warrant should be the shareholder&#146;s tax basis in such share or warrant. Any disposition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes as a disposition of the Class A common share and one-half of one warrant comprising the unit, and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the Class A common share and warrant based on their respective
	fair market values. The separation of the Class A common share and the one-half of one warrant constituting a unit should not be a taxable event for United States federal income tax purposes.

	The foregoing treatment of the Class A common shares and warrants and a holder&#146;s purchase price allocation are not binding on the IRS or
	the courts. Because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the characterization described above or the discussion below.
	Accordingly, each prospective investor is encouraged to consult its tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative characterizations of a unit). The balance of this discussion assumes that the

	As discussed above under the caption &#147;Belgian Tax

	other requirements, be less than 80% of the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. holder immediately before the conversion and, immediately after the conversion, the U.S. holder must own (actually
	and/or constructively) less than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote.&nbsp;In general, there will be a complete termination of a U.S. holder&#146;s interest if either (1) all of the shares of our stock

	Subject to the discussion of the PFIC rules below, and except with respect to a cashless exercise of warrants (as discussed below), a U.S.

	equal to the portion of the purchase price of each unit allocated to the warrant as described above under &#147;&#151;Allocation of Purchase Price and Classification of Units&#148;), increased by the exercise price paid to exercise the warrant. The

	Although holders of warrants may not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, which we understand to be the case currently
	under Belgian law, in the event that holders are able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a cashless exercise of warrants are not clear under current tax law. A cashless exercise may be
	tax-free, either because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization or is otherwise not a gain recognition event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under either of these characterizations, a U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in the Class A common
	shares received upon the cashless exercise of warrants would equal the U.S. holder&#146;s aggregate tax basis in the warrants used to effect the cashless exercise. If the cashless exercise of warrants were to be treated as a recapitalization, the
	holding period of the Class A common shares received in the cashless exercise would include the holding period of the warrants. If the cashless exercise of warrants were not treated as a recapitalization but were otherwise to be treated as not being
	a gain recognition event, a U.S. holder&#146;s holding period of the Class A common shares received in the cashless exercise may be treated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly on the date of exercise) of the

	It is also possible that a cashless exercise of warrants could be
	treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, a U.S. holder may be deemed to have surrendered of warrants having an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise
	price for the total number of warrants deemed exercised. Under one possible analysis, the U.S. holder would recognize U.S.-source capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the warrants deemed
	surrendered to pay the exercise price and the U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in the warrants deemed surrendered. Provided that the warrants were held by a U.S. holder for more than one year at the time of such exercise, any such gain or loss would be
	long-term capital gain or loss. In such case, a U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in the Class A common shares received would equal the sum of the U.S. holder&#146;s initial investment in the warrants exercised (for example, the portion of the U.S.
	holder&#146;s purchase price for the units that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under &#147;&#151;Allocation of Purchase Price and Classification of Units&#148;) and the exercise price of such warrants. It is unclear whether a U.S.
	Holder&#146;s holding period for the Class A common share would commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant.

	recognized on the sale of our common shares generally will be taxable as capital gain and no additional tax charge will be imposed under the PFIC rules. As discussed above, if we are a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. holder of our common shares
	that has made a QEF election will be currently taxed on its pro rata share of our earnings and profits, whether or not distributed for such year. A subsequent distribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income

	adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering.&nbsp;As an additional means of facilitating this offering, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase, units in the open market to stabilize the price of the units.&nbsp;These activities may

	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position of Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. as of July 12, 2016 and the related
	statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the period then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
	financial statements based on our audit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
	evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.&nbsp;An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements
	referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. as of July 12, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the period from June 24, 2016 (inception) to July
	12, 2016, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, Hunter Maritime Acquisition Corp. was incorporated on June 24,
	2016 with a share capital of 25,000 USD. The statement of financial position per July 12, 2016 reflects a total equity of 6,092 USD. This situation raises substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability
	of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the financial support of its ultimate shareholder, Belgische Scheepvaartmaatschappij-Compagnie Maritime Belge (&#147;CMB NV&#148;), and the ability of management to achieve its business
	purpose, as described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

	after the Proposed Public Offering. If the Company increases or decreases the size of the Proposed Public Offering under the Securities Act, the Company will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital, as applicable, immediately

	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,
	the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than
	the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
	connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	.&nbsp;If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder into
	any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Underwriters could purchase
	United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given.&nbsp;The obligation of the Company with respect to any sum due from it to any Underwriter or any person
	controlling any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, not be discharged until the first business day following receipt by such Underwriter or controlling person of any sum in such other
	currency, and only to the extent that such Underwriter or controlling person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency. If the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum
	originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder, the Company agrees as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter or controlling person against such loss.&nbsp;If the United States
	dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder, such Underwriter or controlling person agrees to pay to the Company an amount equal to the excess of the dollars so purchased over the
	sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder.
