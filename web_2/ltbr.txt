	Fuel Technology Business Segment Overview
</U>
</B>
<B>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Since the founding of our company, we have been engaged in the
	design and development of proprietary, innovative nuclear fuels. This effort has
	led us to develop a metallic fuel rod design that is at the heart of each of our
	nuclear fuel products. The Company&#146;s efforts are focused on the success of our
	nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We are currently focusing our development efforts on all-metal
	fuel (i.e., non-oxide fuel) for currently operating as well as new build
	reactors. The Company also owns fuel assembly designs for all-uranium seed and
	blanket fuel for existing plants and new build reactors and thorium-based seed
	and blanket fuel for both existing and new build reactors. Each of the fuel
	designs utilizes our metallic fuel rod technology, and each design advances our
	mission to improve the cost competitiveness, safety, proliferation resistance,
	and performance of nuclear power generation. The Company&#146;s focus on metallic
	fuel is based on input from nuclear utilities that have expressed interest in
	the improved economics and enhanced safety that metallic fuel can provide.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In response to the challenges associated with conventional
	oxide fuels, we believe our innovative, proprietary metallic fuels will be
	capable of significantly higher burnup and power density compared to
	conventional oxide fuels. The fuel in a nuclear reactor generates heat energy.
	That heat is then converted through steam into electricity that is sold. Burnup
	is the total amount of electricity generated per unit mass of nuclear fuel, and
	is a function of the power density of a nuclear fuel and the amount of time the
	fuel operates in the reactor. Power density is the amount of heat power
	generated per unit volume of nuclear fuel. Conventional oxide fuel used in
	existing commercial reactors is approaching the limits of its burnup and power
	density capability. As a result, further optimization to increase power output
	from the same core size and improve the economics and safety of nuclear power generation using conventional oxide
	fuel technologies is limited. As the industry prepares to meet the increasing
	global demand for electricity production, longer operating cycles and higher
	reactor power outputs have become a much sought-after solution for the current
	and future reactor fleet.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We believe our proprietary nuclear fuel designs have the potential to
	significantly enhance the nuclear power industry&#146;s economics and increase power
	output by:
</P>
<UL STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN: JUSTIFY">
<LI>
	providing an increase in power output of up to 10% while simultaneously
	extending the operating cycle length from 18 to 24 months in existing
	pressurized water reactors (which are currently constrained to an 18-month
	operating cycle by oxide fuel); or increasing the power up to 17% while
	retaining an 18-month operating cycle;
<LI>
	enabling increased reactor power output (up to 30% increase) without
	changing the core size in new build pressurized water reactors (PWRs); and
<LI>
	reducing the volume of spent fuel per kilowatt-hour as well as enhancing
	proliferation resistance of spent fuel.
</LI>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	There are significant technology synergies among our primary
	fuel products due to utilization of the proprietary metallic fuel rod technology
	that is at the core of each of them. Once completed, a full-scale demonstration
	and qualification of the metallic fuel rod technology will simultaneously
	advance all of our product families currently under development. Due to the
	significantly lower fuel operating temperature, our metallic nuclear fuel rods
	are expected to provide major improvements to safety margins during off-normal
	events.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We are currently focusing our development efforts on the
	metallic fuel with a power uprate of up to 10% and a 24-month operating cycle in
	existing Westinghouse-type four-loop pressurized water reactors. Those reactors
	represent a large segment of the global market and comprise our initial target
	market. Our metallic fuel could also be adapted for use in other types of
	water-cooled commercial power reactors, such as boiling water reactors, Canada
	Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) heavy water reactors, as well as water-cooled small
	modular reactors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	US Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing processes require
	engineering analysis of a large break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), as well
	as many other scenarios. The LOCA scenario assumes failure of a large water pipe
	in the reactor coolant system. Under LOCA conditions, the fuel and cladding
	temperatures rise due to reduced cooling capacity. Preliminary analytical
	modeling shows that under a design-basis LOCA scenario, unlike conventional
	uranium dioxide fuel, the cladding of the Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel
	rods would stay at least 200 degrees below the 850-900 degrees Celsius
	temperature at which steam begins to react with the zirconium cladding to
	generate hydrogen gas. Buildup of hydrogen gas in a nuclear power plant can lead
	to detonation of the hydrogen. Lightbridge fuel is designed to prevent hydrogen
	gas generation in design-basis LOCA situations, which is a major safety
	benefit.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We believe our fuel designs will allow current and new build
	nuclear reactors to safely increase power production and reduce operations and
	maintenance costs on a per kilowatt-hour basis. New build nuclear reactors could
	also benefit from the reduced upfront capital investment per kilowatt of
	generating capacity. In addition to the projected electricity production cost
	savings, we believe that our technology can result in utilities or countries
	needing to deploy fewer new reactors to generate the same amount of electricity,
	resulting in significant capital cost savings. For utilities or countries that
	already have operating reactors, our technology could be utilized to increase
	the power output of those reactors as opposed to building new reactors. Further,
	we believe that the fuel fabrication or manufacturing process for this new fuel
	design is simpler, which we expect could lower fuel fabrication costs.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our business model expanded with the establishment of a
	consulting business segment in 2007, through which we provide consulting and
	strategic advisory services to companies and governments planning to create or
	expand electricity generation capabilities using nuclear power plants. On August
	1, 2008, we signed separate consulting services agreements with two government
	entities: Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) formed by Abu Dhabi, one of the member Emirates of the
	United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation
	(FANR) formed by the government of the UAE. Under these two original agreements,
	we have provided consulting and strategic advisory services over a contract term
	of five years starting from June 23, 2008. The FANR contract has been extended
	to December 31, 2016. These contracts can each continue to be extended upon
	agreement by both parties. Substantially all of our consulting business segment
	revenue is from foreign sources. We have also signed other consulting contracts
	in 2013 and 2014 with governmental and non-governmental entities to provide
	various consulting services that ended in 2015.

	On December 18, 2015, we entered
	into a letter of agreement with AREVA NP (&#147;AREVA&#148;) setting out the principal
	terms of the potential formation of one or more joint ventures between
	Lightbridge and AREVA to further develop, manufacture, commercialize, and fund
	Lightbridge&#146;s next generation metallic nuclear fuel technology. The letter of
	agreement established a framework for the future collaboration between
	Lightbridge and AREVA. The letter of agreement, as amended, also granted AREVA
	an exclusivity period for negotiations with us regarding formation of joint
	ventures to develop, manufacture, commercialize, and fund our next generation
	metallic nuclear fuel technology, which exclusivity period will expire on
	March 14, 2016 or the later expiration of the joint development
	agreement.
<BR>
<BR>
	On March 14, 2016, we entered into a joint development agreement
	(&#147;JDA&#148;) with AREVA which will define the different steps (including, without
	limitation, a feasibility study, a business plan, and an implementation action
	plan), working groups, and methodology to determine the feasibility and
	opportunity of future joint ventures between the parties. The joint
	development agreement provides the process by which the parties will execute
	definitive documentation for the joint ventures, including a term sheet that
	will set forth the main terms of the definitive joint venture
	agreements.
<BR>
<BR>
	As part of the definitive joint venture agreements, based on
	successful completion of the scope of work under the JDA, Lightbridge and
	AREVA will agree on: (1) terms and conditions to complete the remaining scope
	of work to demonstrate and commercialize the fuel assemblies based on
	Lightbridge&#146;s metallic nuclear fuel, and (2) a technology licensing
	arrangement and other agreements needed to form and operate the joint venture
	company. The companies have agreed to work exclusively together in the area
	covered by the JDA, which will remain in force until the formation of the
	joint venture or December 31, 2016 at the latest.

	On September 9, 2015, we signed a Comprehensive Nuclear Services Agreement
	with Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) for fabrication of our patented next
	generation metallic nuclear fuel test samples at CNL facilities at Chalk
	River, Ontario, Canada. This enabling agreement provides the framework to
	proceed with Phases 2 and 3 of the test fuel sample fabrication at CNL&#146;s
	facilities in Chalk River as envisioned in an October 2014 Initial Cooperation

	We entered into a binding, 10-year service agreement with the IFE, operator
	of the 25 MW Halden Research Reactor, southeast of Oslo, Norway. Beginning in
	2017, we expect our fabricated fuel samples to undergo full irradiation under
	prototypic commercial reactor operating conditions in a pressurized water loop
	of the Halden Research Reactor. The project&#146;s pre-irradiation scope includes
	irradiation-rig mechanical design, detailed neutronic and thermal-hydraulic
	calculations, and safety analyses with necessary regulatory approvals. The
	initial phase of irradiation testing is expected to continue for about three
	years to reach the burnup necessary for insertion of lead test assemblies
	(LTAs) in a commercial power reactor. The final phase of irradiation testing
	necessary for batch reloads and full cores operating with a 10% power uprate
	and a 24-month cycle is expected to take an additional two years and be
	completed while LTAs have begun operating in the core of a commercial power
	reactor. Post-irradiation examination of our partially irradiated fuel samples
	also is planned to begin at Halden in 2018.

<LI>
<P>
	IFE was granted an export license by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign
	Affairs covering all planned activities relating to the Company's nuclear fuel
	in Norway. Planned activities include irradiation testing of our advanced
	metallic fuel samples under prototypic commercial reactor operating
	conditions, as well as discharge of irradiated fuel samples from IFE's Halden
	Research Reactor. The export license is valid for a standard initial term of 3
	years through October 31, 2018, and is extendable. Post-irradiation
	examination of irradiated fuel samples at Studsvik in Sweden requires a
	separate Norwegian export license, for which IFE plans to apply.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	To our knowledge, our nuclear fuel development project is the
	only program that we believe could be commercially viable to increase, in a safe
	and economically attractive way, power output by up to 17% in existing PWRs and
	up to 30% in new build PWRs. Due to long product development timelines,
	significant nuclear regulatory requirements, and our intellectual property, we
	believe that the barriers to entry are very high for a competitor to our nuclear
	fuel technology segment.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Competition with respect to the design of commercially viable
	nuclear fuel products is limited to conventional uranium oxide fuels, which, as
	discussed above, are reaching the limits in terms of their capability to provide
	increased power output or longer fuel cycles. We believe that the industry needs
	fuel products that can provide these benefits. While we believe conventional
	uranium oxide fuel may be capable of achieving power uprates of up to 10% in
	existing PWRs, doing so would require uranium-235 enrichment levels above 5% (as
	is also the case with our metallic fuel), higher reload batch sizes, or a
	combination thereof. The alternative route of increasing reload batch sizes
	while keeping uranium enrichment levels below 5% for power uprates up to 10%
	using conventional uranium oxide fuel raises the cost of each fuel reload,
	resulting in a significant fuel cycle cost penalty to the nuclear utility. The
	cost penalty could have a dramatic adverse impact on the economics of existing
	plants whose original capital cost has already been written off (most US nuclear
	power plants fall into this category).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Due to poor economics, nuclear utilities may be reluctant to
	embrace that route as a way to increase power output by up to 10%, which could
	lead to greater opportunities for use of Lightbridge&#146;s nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	There are several major companies that collectively fabricate a
	large majority of the fuel used in the world&#146;s commercial nuclear power plants,
	including both Western-type PWRs and boiling water reactors (BWRs), as well as
	Russian-type VVERs. To the extent that these companies currently own and may in
	the future develop new nuclear fuel designs that can be used in the same types
	of reactors as those targeted by us, they can be viewed as potential
	competitors. However, our commercialization strategy is not to compete with
	these major fuel fabricators, but rather to partner with one or more of these
	companies through technology license arrangements to extend their fuel offerings
	to their customers with our fuel technologies. For this reason, we consider
	these companies as potential partners or licensees as opposed to competitors.

	The testing, fabrication and use of nuclear fuels by our future

	approvals will lie with our research and development contractors that conduct
	such tests and experiments. Nuclear fuel fabricators, which will ultimately
	fabricate fuel using our technology under commercial licenses from us, are
	similarly regulated. Utilities that operate nuclear power plants that may
	utilize the fuel produced by these fuel fabricators require specific licenses
	relating to possession and use of nuclear materials as well as numerous other
	governmental approvals for the ownership and operation of nuclear power

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Separately, some of the planned critical path research,
	development, and demonstration activities require access to certain highly
	specialized technical expertise and licensed facilities where such development
	and demonstration work can be carried out. There are a limited number of
	commercial entities or government research laboratories in the world that
	possess this kind of technical expertise and have a licensed operating facility,
	including a limited number in the United States. We are currently focusing our
	fuel development efforts with both domestic and overseas development
	partners/vendors. Beginning in 2017, we expect our fabricated fuel samples to
	undergo full irradiation under prototypic commercial reactor operating
	conditions in a pressurized water loop of the Halden Research Reactor in Norway.
	However, the National Nuclear Security Administration (&#147;NNSA&#148;) of the U.S.
	Department of Energy, has informed us that a transfer of our fuel samples to
	Norway would not be possible until the bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear
	cooperation, or a so-called &#147;123 Agreement&#148; between the U.S. and Norway was
	renewed. Under Section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, a
	bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the United States
	and another country must be in place before significant transfers of nuclear
	material, equipment, or components from the United States to the other country.
	The previous Section 123 Agreement with Norway has expired. The State Department
	and Norway have finalized the terms for the renewal of the 123 Agreement. Once
	the new 123 Agreement has been signed by both governments, , the U.S. President
	transmits the proposed agreement to both houses of Congress for a 90-day review
	process. The agreement will become effective unless Congress adopts a joint
	resolution of disapproval. If the 123 Agreement between the United States and
	Norway is not renewed by the time our fuel samples are fabricated and ready for
	shipment (currently expected around the end of 2016), we may risk program
	schedule delays. Such delays could disrupt our fuel technology development
	plans, which may have a detrimental impact on the results of our operations.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A domestic partner/vendor may eliminate the need to seek a
	separate US export license authorization for this work and eliminate the risk of
	the 123 Agreement with Norway not being in place in time to support our current
	schedule. If we proceed with a US national laboratory, any agreement will be
	subject to DOE&#146;s review and approval. Any delay in such approval of our proposed
	agreement by DOE could cause program schedule slippage. If we proceed with a US
	commercial entity, some aspects of the development and demonstration work may
	still require certain US regulatory approvals (e.g., relating to 19.7% enriched
	uranium). Any delay in such regulatory approvals could have an adverse impact on
	our program schedule and future financial results.

	Presently, nuclear power provides approximately 7% of the
	world&#146;s energy, including approximately 11% of the world&#146;s electricity.
	According to the World Nuclear Association, as of January 1, 2016 there were
	approximately 439 operable nuclear power plants worldwide, mostly light water
	reactors, with the most common types being PWRs, BWRs, and VVER reactors (a
	Russian equivalent of PWRs). Nuclear power provides a non-fossil fuel,
	low-carbon energy solution that can meet baseload electricity needs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Due to substantial project risks and the significant upfront
	capital commitment associated with building new reactors, many nuclear utilities
	in deregulated markets choose to optimize their existing generating capacity
	through increasing their capacity utilization factor, power uprates and plant
	life extensions. We expect this trend to continue, particularly in the mature
	nuclear markets with significant existing nuclear capacity. We expect most of
	the new build activity to occur in emerging nuclear markets.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Of the world&#146;s existing reactors currently in operation, PWRs
	(including Russian-designed VVERs) account for more than half of the net
	operating capacity, with BWRs being second accounting for another 20%.

	Of the nuclear reactors currently under construction, over 80%
	are either PWRs or VVERs with a rated electric power output of 1,000 megawatts
	(&#147;MWe&#148;) or greater.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Utilities have utilized power uprates since the 1970&#146;s as a way
	to increase the power output of their nuclear plants. Typically, more highly
	enriched uranium fuel and/or more fresh fuel is needed to increase power output.
	This enables the reactor to produce more thermal energy and therefore more steam
	to drive the turbine generator and produce electricity. In order to accomplish
	this, components such as pipes, valves, pumps, heat exchangers, electrical
	transformers and generators, must be able to accommodate the conditions that
	would exist at the higher power level. For example, a higher power level usually
	involves higher steam and water flow through the systems used to convert thermal
	power into electric power. These systems must be capable of accommodating the
	higher flows.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In some instances, utilities will modify and/or replace
	components in order to accommodate a higher power level. Technical analyses must
	demonstrate that the proposed plant configuration remains safe and that measures
	to protect the health and safety of the public continue to be effective. These
	analyses, which span many technical disciplines, are reviewed and approved by
	the regulator before a power uprate can be performed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The utility will conduct an economic analysis to evaluate the
	potential financial benefits of the proposed uprate. Typically, power uprates
	enable utilities to increase their generating capacity at a cost significantly
	less than the cost of building a new plant. In many cases, power uprates can be
	completed in months as opposed to the several years required for new build, thus
	the invested dollars begin producing revenue shortly after they are spent. Power
	uprates, therefore, represent an efficient use of capital.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Utilities have embraced power uprates as a cost effective way
	to increase their generation capacity. While the efforts thus far have occurred
	mostly in the United States, there is a large, untapped worldwide market for
	power uprates. There are about 150 PWRs operating outside the United States. If
	all of these plants had their power increased by 10%, the aggregate generating
	capacity would increase by about 14,500 MWe. This is equivalent to about 12 new
	1,200 MWe reactors. The incentive to proceed with power uprates at the 10% level
	is significant since there are few changes required to implement the power
	uprate, and the changes that are required are relatively inexpensive. The
	limiting factor at the moment is the fuel. We believe that our metallic fuel rod
	technology will enable the 10% increase in power along with extending the fuel
	cycle to 24 months, and can be used to support even greater power increases up
	to 30%.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Most nuclear power plants originally had a licensed lifetime of
	25 to 40 years, but engineering assessments have established that many can
	operate much longer. In the US, approximately 60 reactors have been granted
	license extensions to continue operating for a total of 60 years. Most of the
	plants that have not already requested a license extension are expected to apply
	in the near future. A license extension at about the 30-year mark requires
	additional capital expenditure for the replacement of worn equipment and
	outdated control systems.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The technical and economic feasibility of replacing major
	reactor components, such as steam generators in PWRs, has been demonstrated. The
	increased revenue generated from extending the lifetime of existing plants is
	attractive to utilities, especially in view of the difficulties in obtaining
	public acceptance of constructing replacement nuclear capacity.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The loss of generating capacity by old plants being retired is
	balanced by new plants coming on line. There are no firm projections for
	retirements over the next two decades, however the World Nuclear Association
	(WNA), estimates that at least 60 of those now operating will close by 2030,
	most being small plants. Using conservative assumptions about license renewal,
	the 2009 WNA Market Report anticipates that approximately 143 reactors will be
	decommissioned by 2030.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Almost all of the new build reactor designs are either
	Generation III or Generation III+ type reactors. The primary difference from
	second-generation designs is that many incorporate passive or inherent safety
	features which require no active controls or operational intervention to avoid
	accidents in the event of malfunction. Many of these passive systems rely on gravity,
	natural convection, or resistance to high temperatures.

	The major nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant
	in Japan following the strong earthquake and massive tsunami that occurred on

	resulting in a slowdown in, or, in some cases, a complete halt to, new
	construction of nuclear power plants and an early shut down of existing power
	plants in certain countries. As a result, some countries that were considering
	launching new domestic nuclear power programs before the Fukushima accident have
	delayed or cancelled preparatory activities they were planning to undertake as
	part of such programs. This has diminished the number of consulting
	opportunities that we could compete for globally, at least in the near-term. In

	Presently, we are targeting Western-type PWR reactors with a

	These reactors represent the largest market segment, both in terms of operating
	reactors and new build units under construction or planned. Our technology is
	applicable to many more reactors than those included in our initial target

	the largest commercial market segment with the highest potential for return on
	investment in the near-term.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Based on the WNA&#146;s reactor database, we estimate that the

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This segment is primarily engaged in the business of assisting
	commercial and governmental entities globally with developing and expanding
	their nuclear industry capabilities and infrastructure. We provide integrated
	strategic advice across a range of expertise areas including, for example,
	regulatory development, nuclear reactor site selection, procurement and
	deployment, reactor and fuel technology, international relations, program
	management and infrastructure development.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Due to the relatively limited growth in the nuclear energy
	industry during the 1980&#146;s and 1990&#146;s, and corresponding limited recruitment
	into the industry, the cadre of engineers, managers and other nuclear energy
	industry experts is aging. In any nuclear renaissance, we believe that the
	industry will be challenged in acquiring and retaining sufficient qualified
	expertise. In countries studying the potential of establishing new nuclear
	energy programs, the number of qualified nuclear energy personnel is limited,
	and we believe that those countries will need to rely on significant support
	from non-domestic service providers and experts to ensure success in those
	programs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our emergence in the field of nuclear energy consulting is in
	direct response to the need for independent assessments and highly qualified
	technical consulting services from countries looking to establish nuclear energy
	programs, by providing a blueprint for safe, secure, reliable, and
	cost-effective nuclear power. We offer full-scope strategic planning and
	advisory services for new and growing existing markets. Furthermore, we only
	engage with commercial entities and governments that are dedicated to
	non-proliferative and transparent nuclear programs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our consulting services are expert and relationship based, with
	particular emphasis on key decision makers in senior positions within
	governments or companies, as well as focus on overall management of nuclear
	energy programs. To date, nearly all of our revenues have been derived from our
	consulting and strategic advisory services business segment, which primarily
	provides nuclear consulting services to entities within the United Arab
	Emirates, our first significant consulting and strategic advisory client. We
	have also provided nuclear safety consulting advice to US nuclear utilities. We
	expect to be working both directly and as a subcontractor to larger companies
	for our new consulting contracts in 2016 and beyond and utilizing less outside
	consulting firms to provide us with consulting services in the future.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Competition in Nuclear Industry Consulting
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In general, the market for nuclear industry consulting services
	is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid change. The market includes a
	large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise,
	including local, regional, national, and international firms that specialize in
	political assessment, legal and regulatory framework, nuclear technology, or
	program implementation. Some of these companies are global in scope and have
	greater personnel, financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. The
	larger companies offering similar services as we do typically are also active in
	the delivery of nuclear power plant equipment and/or provision of engineering
	design services. We believe that our independence, experience, expertise,
	reputation and segment focus, enable us to compete effectively in this
	marketplace as a strategic advisor for those governments wishing to develop a
	new civil nuclear program.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our major challenge in pursuing our business is that the
	decision making process for nuclear power programs typically involves careful
	consideration by many parties and therefore requires significant time. Many of
	the potential clients that could benefit from our services are in regions of the
	world where tensions surrounding nuclear energy are high, or in countries where
	public opinion plays an important role. Domestic and international political
	pressure and public opposition to nuclear power may hinder our efforts to
	provide nuclear energy consulting services.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Employees
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our business model is to limit the number of our full-time
	employees and to rely on individual independent contractors, outside agencies
	and technical facilities with specific skills to assist with various business
	functions including, but not limited to: corporate overhead personnel, research
	and development, and government relations. This model limits overhead costs and
	allows us to draw upon resources that are specifically tailored to our internal
	and external (client) needs. As of December 31, 2015, we had seven full-time
	employees and two part-time employees. We utilize a network of independent
	contractors available for deployment for specialized consulting assignments. We
	believe that our relationship with our employees and contractors is
	satisfactory.

	Thorium Power, Inc. and changed our name to Thorium Power, Ltd. Thorium Power,
	Inc. was incorporated on January 8, 1992. In 2008, we formed Lightbridge
	International Holding, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) to be a
	holding company for our foreign branch offices. Our foreign branch offices were
	set up to facilitate our international operations. We registered a branch office
	in England in 2008 called Lightbridge Advisors Limited and a branch office in
	Moscow, Russia in July 2009, which we are in the process of closing. On
	September 21, 2009, we changed our name from Thorium Power Ltd. to Lightbridge

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As noted above, we have incurred recurring losses since
	inception and expect to continue to incur losses as a result of costs and
	expenses related to our research and continued development of our nuclear fuel
	and our corporate general and administrative expenses. Our limited capital
	resources and operations to date have been funded through sales of our equity
	securities. As of December 31, 2015, we had working capital of approximately
	$0.1 million, cash of approximately $0.6 million, stockholders&#146; deficit of
	approximately $1.5 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $74.4
	million. As a result, we have included a discussion about our ability to
	continue as a going concern in our consolidated financial statements, and our
	auditor&#146;s report for year ended December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory
	paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
	&#147;going concern.&#148; In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash
	from our operating activities or raise additional funds, we may be required to
	delay, reduce or severely curtail our operations or otherwise impede our
	on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our
	business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects.

	On November 27, 2015, we received a letter from the Listing
	Qualifications staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that we are no
	longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders&#146; equity requirement for
	continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq initially provided us
	with 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum
	stockholders&#146; equity standard. Our plan to regain compliance was accepted and
	Nasdaq granted an extension of 180 calendar days from the date of the
	notification letter or May 25, 2016 to regain compliance with the minimum
	stockholders&#146; equity requirement. There can be no assurance that we will be able
	to regain compliance with the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Subsequently, on December 11, 2015, we received a letter from
	the Listing Qualifications staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market notifying us that
	for the preceding 30 consecutive business days our common stock did not maintain
	a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share as required by Nasdaq
	Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). We have a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until
	June 8, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price
	requirement for continued listing. In the event we do not regain compliance by
	June 8, 2016, we may be provided an additional 180-day compliance period,
	subject to certain requirements. If we are unable to regain compliance with the
	minimum closing bid price requirement, the Nasdaq staff could provide notice
	that our common stock is subject to delisting. There can be no assurance that we
	will regain compliance with the minimum closing bid requirement.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If we fail to regain compliance with, or otherwise fail to
	comply with, all applicable continued requirements, Nasdaq may determine to
	delist our common stock, which could substantially decrease trading in our
	common stock and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and
	cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, our ability
	to raise additional capital, including through future at-the-market offerings
	and other offerings utilizing short-form registration statements on Form S-3,
	would be substantially impaired.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	We will need to raise significant additional capital in
	the future to expand our operations and continue our research and development
	and we may be unable to raise such funds when needed and on acceptable terms.
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We will need to raise significant additional capital in order
	to continue our research and development activities and fund our operations. Our
	current plan is to seek external funding from third party sources to support a
	large portion of the remaining development, testing and demonstration activities
	relating to our metallic nuclear fuel technology. The extent to which we utilize
	the Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital as a source of funding will depend on
	a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock,
	the volume of trading in our common stock and the extent to which we are able to
	secure funds from other sources. The number of shares that we may sell to Aspire
	Capital under the Purchase Agreement on any given day and during the term of the
	Purchase Agreement is limited. See Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated
	Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form
	10-K for additional information about our Aspire Capital Transaction.
	Additionally, we and Aspire Capital may not affect any sales of shares of our
	common stock under the Purchase Agreement during the continuance of an event of
	default or on any trading day that the closing sale price of our common stock is
	less than $0.10 per share. Even if we are able to access the full $10.0 million
	under the Purchase Agreement, we will still need additional capital to fully
	implement our business, operating and development plans.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	When we elect to raise additional funds or additional funds are
	required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private
	equity offerings, debt financings or other financing alternatives, as well as
	through sales of common stock to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement.
	Additional equity or debt financing or other alternative sources of capital may
	not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our
	stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would
	result in substantial fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that
	include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions,
	such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring
	dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which
	are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise
	additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may
	not be able to fully develop our nuclear fuel designs, our future operations
	will be limited, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain
	future profitability will be substantially harmed.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We are subject to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
	2002, particularly Section 404, and the applicable SEC rules and regulations
	that require an annual management report on our internal controls over financial
	reporting. The management report includes, among other matters, management's
	assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
	reporting.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over
	financial reporting and we may not be capable of maintaining an effective system
	of internal control in the future. The material weakness relates to our previous
	interpretation of ASC 815 and our initial classification and subsequent
	accounting for warrants. This material weakness resulted in a misstatement of
	our liabilities, non-cash expense relating to the changes in fair value of
	common stock warrants, additional paid-in capital, accumulated deficit accounts
	and related financial disclosures. Management took steps during the fourth
	quarter of 2015 to ensure that the Company's accounting staff is knowledgeable
	about ASC 815 and its application to the Company. Based on the measures taken

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Successful execution of our business model is dependent upon
	public support for nuclear power in the United States and other countries.
	Nuclear power faces strong opposition from certain competitive energy sources,
	individuals, and organizations. The major nuclear accident that occurred at the
	Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan beginning on March 11, 2011 increased
	public opposition to nuclear power in some countries, resulting in a slowdown
	in, or, in some cases, a complete halt to, new construction of nuclear power
	plants, an early shut down of existing power plants, or a dampening of the
	favorable regulatory climate needed to introduce new nuclear technologies. In
	addition, the Fukushima accident appears to have shrunk the projected size of
	the global nuclear power market in 2025-2030 as reflected in the most recent
	reference case projections published by the World Nuclear Association. As a
	result of the Fukushima accident, some countries that were considering launching
	new domestic nuclear power programs have delayed or cancelled preparatory
	activities they were planning to undertake as part of such programs. This has
	diminished the number of consulting opportunities that we could compete on
	globally, at least in the near-term. Furthermore, nuclear fuel fabrication and
	the use of new nuclear fuels in reactors must be licensed by the US Nuclear
	Regulatory Commission and equivalent governmental authorities around the world.
	In many countries, the licensing process includes public hearings in which
	opponents of the use of nuclear power might be able to cause the issuance of
	required licenses to be delayed or denied.

	Risks Related to Our Fuel Technology Business
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Our fuel designs have never been tested in an existing
	commercial reactor and actual fuel performance, as well as the willingness of
	commercial reactor operators and fuel fabricators to adopt a new design, is
	uncertain.
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Nuclear power research and development entails significant
	technological risk. New designs must undergo extensive development and testing
	necessary for regulatory approval. Our fuel designs are still in the research
	and development stage and while certain testing on our fuel technologies has
	been completed, further testing and experiments will be required in test
	facilities. Furthermore, the fuel technology has yet to be demonstrated in
	operating conditions analogous to those found in an existing commercial reactor.
	Until we are able to successfully demonstrate operation of our fuel designs in
	commercial reactor conditions, we will not be certain about the ability of the
	fuel we design to perform as expected. In addition, there is also a risk that
	suitable testing facilities may not be available to us on a timely basis or at a
	reasonable cost, which could cause development program schedule delays.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We will also have to enter into a commercial arrangement with a
	fuel fabricator to produce fuel using our designs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If our fuel designs do not perform as anticipated in commercial
	reactor conditions, we will not realize revenues from licensing or other use of
	our fuel designs.

	Potential competitors could limit opportunities to

</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Part of our strategy is to partner with major fuel fabricators
	through technology licensing arrangements. However, these fuel fabricators may
	potentially develop new nuclear fuel designs that can be used in the same types
	of reactors as those that we target. Existing fuel fabricators also have
	established commercial connections to nuclear power facilities that we do not
	have. If these types of companies were to compete with our nuclear fuel design
	technology, opportunities to license our technology would be limited.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Moreover, many of these fuel fabricators have substantially
	greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development
	resources and experience than we do. These larger companies may be better able
	to handle the corresponding long-term financial requirements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	We serve the nuclear power industry, which is highly

	development program schedule delays. Entities within the nuclear industry may be
	hesitant to be the first to use our fuel, which has little or no history of
	successful commercial use. Furthermore, our fuel development timeline relies on
	the relevant nuclear regulator to accept and approve technical information and
	documentation about our fuel that is generated during the research and
	development program. There is a risk that regulators may require additional

	Existing commercial nuclear infrastructure in many

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Existing commercial nuclear infrastructure, including
	conversion facilities, enrichment facilities, fabrication facilities, fuel
	storage facilities, fuel handling procedures, fuel operation at reactor sites,
	used fuel storage facilities and shipping containers, were designed and are
	currently licensed to handle uranium enrichment up to 5%. Our fuel designs are
	expected to have enrichment levels up to 19.7% and would therefore require
	certain modifications to existing commercial nuclear infrastructure to enable
	commercial nuclear facilities to handle our fuels. Those nuclear facilities will
	need to go through a regulatory licensing process and obtain regulatory
	approvals to be able to handle uranium with enrichment levels up to 19.7% and
	operate commercial reactors using our fuel. There is a risk that some relevant
	entities within the nuclear power industry may be slow in making any required
	facility infrastructure modifications or obtaining required licenses or
	approvals to handle our fuel or operate commercial reactors using our fuel.
	There is also a risk associated with possible negative perception of uranium
	enrichment greater than 5% that could potentially delay or hinder regulatory
	approval of our nuclear fuel designs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our nuclear fuel designs rely on fabrication technologies that
	in certain material ways are different from the fabrication techniques presently
	utilized by existing commercial fuel fabricators. In particular, our metallic
	fuel rods must be produced using a co-extrusion fabrication process. Presently,
	most commercial nuclear fuel is produced using a pellet fabrication technology,
	whereby uranium oxide is packed into small pellets that are stacked and sealed
	inside metallic tubes. Our co-extrusion fabrication technology involves
	extrusion of a single-piece solid fuel rod from a metallic matrix containing
	uranium and zirconium alloy. Fabrication of full-length (approximately 3.5 to
	4.5 meters) PWR metallic fuel rods has yet to be demonstrated. There is a risk
	that the fuel fabrication process utilized to produce one meter long metallic
	fuel rods may not be adaptable to the fabrication of full-length metallic fuel
	rods used in commercial reactors.

	Our plans to develop our fuel designs depend on our
	ability to acquire the rights to the designs, data, processes, and methodologies
	that are used or may be used in our business in the future. If we are unable to
	obtain such rights on reasonable terms in the future or develop our own know-how
	necessary for fabrication of our nuclear fuel designs, our ability to exploit
	our intellectual property may be limited.
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We do not currently possess all of the necessary know-how or
	have licensing or other rights to acquire or utilize certain designs, data,
	methodologies, or processes required for the fabrication of our fuel assemblies.
	If we, or a fuel fabricator to which we license our fuel technology, desires to
	utilize such existing processes or methodologies in the future, a license or
	other right to use such technologies from other entities that previously
	developed and own such technologies would be required. Alternatively, we would
	have to develop our own know-how necessary for fabrication of our metallic fuel
	rods and fuel assembly components. Nuclear operators typically seek diversity of
	fuel supply and may be hesitant to use a fuel product that is only available
	from a single supplier. If we are unable to obtain a license or other right to
	acquire or utilize certain processes or develop our own know-how required for
	the fabrication of our metallic fuel rods and fuel assembly components, or there
	is only a single supplier of our fuel assemblies, then we may not be able to
	fully exploit our intellectual property and may be hindered in the sale of our
	fuel products and services.

	In October 2014, we announced the signing of an Initial
	Cooperation Agreement with CNL in Canada to perform fabrication and loop
	irradiation testing of Lightbridge-designed fuel samples at CNL&#146;s existing
	facilities at Chalk River, ON, Canada. At the time of the announcement of the
	Initial Cooperation Agreement, our preference was for all of the proposed work
	to take place at a single location in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada.
	Subsequently, on February 9, 2015, the Canadian government made an official
	decision to extend the operating life of the National Research Universal reactor
	at Chalk River from 2016 through March 31, 2018. This shorter than expected
	operating life extension would not be able to accommodate all of our anticipated
	schedule for irradiation testing of our metallic fuel samples. Shipping
	partially irradiated fuel samples from Canada to another research reactor in a
	different country would entail significantly higher shipping costs, longer
	timelines, and more challenging transportation logistics. As a result, our
	current plan is to work with CNL on fabrication of our fuel samples at their
	Chalk River facilities, with full irradiation of the fabricated fuel samples to
	be performed in a pressurized water loop of the Halden Research Reactor located
	in Halden, Norway. The operating license of the Halden Research Reactor has
	recently been renewed through 2020 which would allow us to maintain our proposed
	irradiation testing schedule. Our current plan is to have post-irradiation
	examination of the irradiated fuel samples performed on the same site in Norway
	or to utilize additional nearby hot cell facilities located in Studsvik, Sweden
	that are operated by the Swedish company Studsvik AB.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In February 2015, in response to our request for guidance, the
	National Nuclear Security Administration of the US Department of Energy, or
	NNSA, confirmed that the proposed activities relating to fabrication,
	irradiation testing and post-irradiation examination of our fuel samples as
	outlined in our revised plan are generally authorized. However, the NNSA
	supplementally stated that a transfer of our fuel samples to Norway would not be
	possible until the bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation, a
	so-called &#147;123 Agreement&#148; between the United States and Norway was renewed.
	Under Section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, a bilateral
	agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the United States and another
	country must be in place before significant transfers of nuclear material,
	equipment, or components from the United States to such other country. The U.S.
	Department of State and Norway are presently negotiating the renewal of the 123
	Agreement. Once the terms of the Section 123 Agreement are agreed to by the
	State Department, the proposed agreement must be submitted to the President for
	review and approval. After presidential approval, the President transmits the
	proposed agreement to both houses of Congress for a 90-day review process. The
	agreement will become effective unless Congress adopts a joint resolution of
	disapproval. If the 123 Agreement between the United States and Norway is not
	renewed by the time our fuel samples are fabricated and ready for shipment
	(currently expected around the end of 2016), we may risk program schedule

	rights with respect to our nuclear fuel designs. The cost to us of any patent
	litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be
	substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such
	litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater
	financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and
	continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material
	adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation
	and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.

	Our nuclear fuel process is dependent on outside
	suppliers of nuclear and other materials and any difficulty by a fuel fabricator
	in obtaining these materials could be detrimental to our ability to eventually
	market our fuel through a fuel fabricator.
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Production of fuel assemblies using our nuclear fuel designs is
	dependent on the ability of fuel fabricators to obtain supplies of nuclear
	material utilized in our fuel assembly design. Fabricators will also need to
	obtain metal for components, particularly zirconium or its alloys. These
	materials are regulated and can be difficult to obtain or may have unfavorable
	pricing terms. Any difficulties in obtaining these materials by fuel fabricators
	could have a material adverse effect on their ability to market fuel based on
	our technology.

	Applicable Russian intellectual property law may be
	inadequate to protect some of our intellectual property, which could have a

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Intellectual property rights are evolving in Russia, and are
	trending towards international norms, but are by no means fully developed. We
	have worked closely with employees in Russia and other Russian contractors and
	entities to develop some of our material intellectual property. Some of our
	earlier intellectual property rights originate from our patent filings in
	Russia. Our worldwide rights in some of this intellectual property, therefore, may be affected by Russian intellectual property
	laws. If the application of Russian laws to some of our intellectual property
	rights proves inadequate, then we may not be able to fully avail ourselves of
	all of our intellectual property, and our business model may be impeded.

	Risks Associated With Our Consulting Activities
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Our inability to attract business from new clients,
	maintain current levels of business, or retain our existing clients could have a
	material adverse effect on us.
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We expect that many of our future client engagement agreements
	will be terminable by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty.
	Some of our work may involve multiple engagements or stages. In those
	engagements, there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for
	additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay
	additional planned engagements. In addition, a small number of existing clients
	account for a majority of our consulting revenues, the loss of any one of which
	would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Some of our
	existing clients reduced their utilization of our consulting services beginning
	in 2013. Our current consulting clients are not contractually obligated to
	purchase a certain level of services from us and may significantly reduce their
	utilization of our services, resulting in a material reduction in revenue.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Our future profitability will suffer if we are not able
	to maintain current pricing and utilization rates.
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our revenue, and our profitability, will be largely based on
	the billing rates charged to clients and the number of hours our professionals
	work on client engagements, which we define as the &#147;utilization&#148; of our
	professionals. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the pricing for our
	services or an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals, revenues,
	project profit margins and our future profitability will suffer.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Bill rates and utilization rates are affected by a number of
	factors, including:
</P>
<UL STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN: JUSTIFY">
<LI>
<P>
	our ability to predict future demand for services and maintain the
	appropriate headcount and minimize the number of underutilized personnel;
</P>
<LI>
<P>
	our clients&#146; perceptions of our ability to add value through our services;
</P>
<LI>
<P>
	our competitors&#146; pricing for similar services;
</P>
<LI>
<P>
	the market demand for our services; and
</P>
<LI>
<P>
	our ability to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as
	we increase the number of our professionals and execute our growth strategies.
</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
<I>
	Unsuccessful future client engagements could result in
	damage to our professional reputation or legal liability, which could have a
	material adverse effect on us.
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our professional reputation and that of our personnel is
	critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and
	attract or retain professionals. Any factors that damage our professional
	reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Any client engagements that we obtain will be subject to the
	risk of legal liability. Any public assertion or litigation alleging that our
	services were negligent or that we breached any of our obligations to a client
	could expose us to significant legal liabilities, could distract our management,
	and could damage our reputation. We carry professional liability insurance, but
	our insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could
	potentially arise from our engagements. The limits of our insurance coverage may
	not be enough to cover a particular claim or a group of claims, and the costs of
	defense.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Global economic and political conditions affect our clients&#146;

	our clients and the industries we serve. Clients could determine that
	discretionary projects are no longer viable or that new projects are not
	advisable. This may reduce demand for our services, depress pricing for our
	services, or render certain services obsolete, all of which could have a
	material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic
	conditions or the regulatory or legislative landscape could also shift demand to
	services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could
	negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Although we
	have implemented cost management measures, if we are unable to appropriately
	manage costs or if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic
	and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond
	to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.

</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We are a leading nuclear fuel technology company, and
	participate in the nuclear power industry in the US and internationally. Our
	business operations can be categorized into two segments: (i) our technology
	segment, which is a developer of next generation nuclear fuel technology that
	has the potential to significantly improve the economics of existing and new
	nuclear power plants by uprating the power output of reactors, reducing the
	per-unit of electricity cost of generating energy, and also improving the
	reactor safety margins and reducing nuclear waste and proliferation potential,
	and (ii) our consulting segment, which provides nuclear power consulting and
	strategic advisory services to commercial and governmental entities worldwide,
	both in nuclear power generation and nuclear regulation.

<I>
<U>
	Climate Change and Nuclear Energy Fuel Market
</U>
</I>
<I>
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We see an increasing trend globally toward addressing climate
	change, which causes us to focus more closely on our nuclear fuel technology as
	a means for doing so.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Nuclear power is useful as a means to reduce greenhouse gas
	emissions since reactors emit no carbon dioxide. Lightbridge metallic nuclear
	fuel technology is well-suited to be used as a means to prevent climate change
	since the fuel can be used in existing reactors, as well as in new reactors that
	will be deployed. Increased electricity generation resulting from use of
	Lightbridge fuel will be a low-cost option to add base load electricity to the
	electric grid of any country that already has a reactor that can use Lightbridge
	fuel. In our analysis, the world can only meet its growing energy and climate
	goals with increased use of nuclear power, and commercialization of Lightbridge
	metallic fuel will be facilitated by the fuel&#146;s climate change benefits.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In certain markets with a diversified energy base, decisions on
	new build power plants are largely affected by the economics of various energy
	sources. If prices of non-nuclear energy sources, in particular natural gas,
	fall below or remain below the cost of electricity from new nuclear generation
	facilities, it could limit the deployment of new build nuclear power plants in
	such markets. This could reduce the size of the potential markets for our fuel
	technology. If prices or production costs of non-nuclear energy increase, there
	may be increased demand for the deployment of new build nuclear power
	plants.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We are currently working under separate agreements with CNL and
	BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc. to demonstrate feasibility of fabrication of
	semi-scale irradiation fuel samples at their existing facilities in Canada and
	the United States, respectively. Once the initial phase of work involving
	development of a fabrication plan is completed in the first half of 2016, we
	plan to select one of these two entities as our primary vendor for fabrication
	of the fuel samples for irradiation testing in Norway, with the other entity
	serving as a back-up option.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As previously stated, preparatory work for irradiation testing
	is also underway at IFE, operator of the 25 MW Halden Research Reactor,
	southeast of Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We currently expect to incur approximately $3-3.5 million in
	research and development costs over the next 12-15 months.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In support of our long-term business plan with respect to our
	fuel technology business, we endeavor to create strategic alliances with major
	nuclear fuel vendors, fuel fabricators and/or other strategic parties during the
	next three years, to support the remaining research and development activities
	required to further enhance and complete the development of our fuel products to
	a commercial stage. On January 12, 2016, we issued a press release announcing
	our entry into an initial services agreement with BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc., a
	wholly owned subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc., to evaluate the ability to
	fabricate and prepare a preliminary plan for fabrication of Lightbridge-designed
	partial length nuclear fuel samples at BWXT facilities in the United States.
	This arrangement can provide us with an alternative vendor and site to CNL for
	fabrication of our patented next generation metallic nuclear fuel test samples
	for irradiation testing at the Halden Research Reactor.

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The SEC issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, &#147;Cautionary
	Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies&#148; suggesting that
	companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical
	accounting policies. In Financial Reporting Release No. 60, the SEC has defined
	the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the
	portrayal of a company&#146;s financial condition and operating results, and require
	management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a
	result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
	Based on this definition, we have identified the following significant policies
	as critical to the understanding of our financial statements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make a variety
	of estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
	of the financial statements and (ii) the reported amounts of revenues and
	expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our management expects to make judgments and estimates about
	the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables
	and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increase,
	these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe
	that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ
	significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and assumptions based
	upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operation and/or financial condition. We have identified certain
	accounting policies that we believe are most important to the understanding of
	our current financial condition and results of operations.

<U>
	Derivative Instruments
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our issued and outstanding warrants to purchase Common Stock
	contain provisions whereby the warrants do not meet the requirements for
	classification as equity and are recorded as derivative warrant liabilities. We
	used valuation methods and assumptions that consider among other factors the
	fair value of the underlying stock, risk-free interest rate, volatility,
	expected life and dividend rates consistent with those discussed in Note 10,
	"Warrant Liability" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
	of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in estimating the fair value for these
	warrants. Such derivative warrant liabilities are initially recorded at fair
	value with subsequent changes in fair value charged (credited) to operations in
	each reporting period. The fair value of the derivative warrant liability is
	most sensitive to changes in the fair value of the underlying Common Stock and
	the estimated volatility of our Common Stock. The nature of the warrant
	liability is such (i.e., the warrant holders receive more value when the
	Company&#146;s stock price is higher) that increases in the Company&#146;s stock price
	during the period result in losses on the Company&#146;s statement of operations
	while decreases in the Company&#146;s stock price result the Company recording
	income.

<U>
	Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Stock Options and
	Stock Granted to Employees and Non-employees
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We adopted the requirements for stock-based compensation, where
	all forms of share-based payments to employees or non-employees, including stock
	options and stock purchase plans, are treated the same as any other form of
	compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under these requirements, stock-based compensation expense for
	employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award,
	and the expense is recognized ratably over the award&#146;s vesting period.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The stock-based compensation expense incurred by Lightbridge in
	connection with its employees is based on the employee model of ASC 718. Under
	ASC 718 employee is defined as &#147;An individual over whom the grantor of a
	share-based compensation award exercises or has the right to exercise sufficient
	control to establish an employer-employee relationship based on common law as
	illustrated in case law and currently under US tax regulations.&#148; Our advisory
	board members and consultants do not meet the employer-employee relationship as
	defined by the IRS and therefore stock-based compensation to them is accounted
	for under ASC 505-50. Under these requirements, stock-based compensation expense
	for non-employees is based on the fair value of the award on the measurement
	date which is the earlier of the date at which a commitment for performance by
	the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached (a performance
	commitment), or the date at which the counterparty&#146;s performance is complete.
	For all grants made, we recognize compensation cost under the straight-line
	method.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We measure the fair value of stock options on the measurement
	date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which requires the use of
	several estimates, including:

	We use the historical volatility of our stock price over the
	number of years that matches the expected life of our stock option grants or we
	use the historical volatility of our stock price since January 5, 2006, the date
	we announced that we were becoming a public company, to estimate the future
	volatility of our stock. At this time we do not believe that there is a better
	objective method to predict the future volatility of our stock. The expected
	life of options is based on internal studies of historical experience and
	projected exercise behavior. We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based
	awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards
	expected to vest. The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual
	forfeiture rate. Estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and
	may change based on new facts and circumstances. We utilize a risk-free interest rate, which is
	based on the yield of US treasury securities with a maturity equal to the
	expected life of the options. We have not and do not expect to pay dividends on
	our common shares for the foreseeable future.

	Revenue Recognition from Consulting Contracts
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	One of our critical accounting policies is revenue recognition
	from our consulting contracts. We are currently primarily deriving our revenue
	from fees by offering consulting and strategic advisory services to commercial
	and government owned entities outside the US planning to create or expand
	electricity generation capabilities, using nuclear power plants. Our fee type
	and structure for each client engagement depend on a number of variables,
	including the size of the client, the complexity, the level of the opportunity
	for us to improve the client&#146;s electricity generation capabilities using nuclear
	power plants, and other factors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We entered into two consulting agreements in August 2008 with the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) and the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR). We recognize revenue associated with these contracts in accordance with the time and expense billed to our customer, which is subject to their review and approval. When a loss is anticipated on a contract, the full amount of the anticipated loss is recognized immediately. Our management uses its judgment concerning the chargeable number of hours to bill under each contract considering a number of factors, including the experience of the personnel that are performing the services, the value of the services provided and the overall complexity of the project. Should changes in management&rsquo;s estimates be required, due to business conditions that cause the actual financial results to differ significantly from management&rsquo;s present estimates, revenue recognized in future periods could be adversely affected.

	Over the next 12 to 15 months, we expect to incur approximately $3 million to $3.5 million in research and development expenses related to the development of our proprietary nuclear fuel designs, contingent on us raising additional equity capital in 2016. We spent approximately $1.5 million for research and development during each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Over the next 2-3 years, we expect that our research and
	development activities will increase and will be primarily focused on testing
	and demonstration of our metallic fuel technology for Western-type water-cooled
	reactors. The main objective of this research and development phase is to
	prepare for full-scale demonstration of our fuel technology in an operating
	commercial power reactor.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	At the present time, all of our revenue for the years ended
	December 31, 2015 and 2014 is from our consulting services business segment and
	is derived by offering services to governments outside of the US planning to
	create or expand electricity generation capabilities using nuclear power plants.
	The fee type and structure that we offer for each client engagement is dependent
	on a number of variables, including the complexity of the services, the level of
	the opportunity for us to improve the client&#146;s electricity generation
	capabilities using nuclear power plants, and other factors.

	The decrease in our revenues from 2014 to 2015 of $0.4 million
	resulted from the net decrease in the work performed for our FANR and ENEC
	projects of approximately $0.6 million. This decrease was partially offset by an
	increase in our consulting revenues from Lloyds Register of approximately $0.2
	million. Our consulting projects with ENEC and FANR are being performed pursuant
	to ongoing requests to work on specific projects on a time and expense basis as
	needed. The FANR contract was extended to December 31, 2016. The future revenue
	to be earned and recognized under both the ENEC and FANR agreements will depend
	upon agreed upon work plans that are under current discussion, which can differ
	from the revenue amounts initially planned to be earned under these
	agreements.

	The market for nuclear industry consulting services is

	compete effectively in this marketplace. We see a declining future trend in our
	nuclear consulting business segment.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The decrease in our cost of services provided for the years
	ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 resulted from less revenue and margins earned
	due to increased pricing competition in 2015, which was offset by an increase in
	stock-based compensation in 2015. Cost of services provided is comprised of
	expenses related to the consulting, professional, administrative, and other
	support costs and stock-based compensation allocated to our consulting projects
	labor, which were incurred to perform and support the work done for our
	consulting projects with ENEC, FANR and our other contracts. The billing rates
	to us from our consultants who provide services under our consulting contracts
	predominantly remained the same in 2015 and 2014. If consulting revenues
	increase in future periods, we expect cost of services provided will increase in
	dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues due to increased
	pricing competition for consulting contracts.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Total reported gross profit margin for the years ended December
	31, 2015 was 24% compared to 42% for the years ended December 31, 2014, because
	of increased stock-based compensation in 2015 and increased pricing competition
	for consulting contracts.

	To date, our consulting revenue has not provided sufficient

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The primary potential sources of cash available to us are equity investments through our purchase agreement with Aspire Capital and our ATM agreement with MLV. We have no debt or debt credit lines and we have financed our operations to date through our consulting revenue and the sale of our common stock. We raised approximately $0.2 million in 2015 from our ATM financing agreement, and as of the date of this filing, we have raised approximately $1.2 million in 2016 through our equity purchase agreement with Aspire. On November 17, 2014, we raised approximately $4.5 million after payment of certain fees and expenses in a registered direct offering.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As of December 31, 2015, we had total cash and cash equivalents
	of approximately $0.6 million and approximately $0.3 million in restricted cash.
	Our working capital at December 31, 2015, was approximately $0.1 million. Our
	current average monthly cash flow shortfall based on our current operations, is
	averaging approximately $300,000 per month, and we expect this shortfall to
	increase to approximately $400,000 per month through the remainder of 2016 as we
	increase spending on research and development. Based on our December 31, 2015
	working capital amount and our current projected monthly operating cash flow
	shortfall, our current working capital without additional financing is not
	sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months. We are working to reduce our monthly cash flow
	shortfall and will also seek new sources of financing. We may delay incurring
	some operating expenses, which will reduce our cash flow shortfall for the next
	12 months, if needed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We have put in place an ATM financing arrangement with MLV and
	an equity purchase agreement with Aspire Capital to fund our future research and
	development expenses and overhead expenses over the next 12 months. Based on the

	and others, we expect to have sufficient working capital for the next 12 months

	The decrease in our cash used in operating activities in 2015
	was primarily due to the change in revenue and operating expenses as explained
	above and the change in working capital items as explained below.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of net loss adjusted for non-cash (income) expense items such as depreciation and amortization and warrant revaluation, as well as the effect of changes in working capital. Cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of a net loss of $4.3 million and net adjustments to net loss for non-cash income items totaling $0.0 million, consisting of non-cash adjustments or decrease to net loss for stock-based compensation of $1.9 million and abandonment loss of $0.4 million and a non-cash adjustment or increase to net loss for the warrant revaluation income of $2.3 million. Total cash provided by working capital totaled $0.7 million. The cash provided by working capital was due primarily to the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.3 million, due to the decrease in our cash balances and a decrease in accounts receivable and other of $0.4 million, primarily due to the decrease in our revenue in 2015.

	On September 4, 2015, we entered into an equity purchase agreement with Aspire Capital, which provides that Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of shares of our common stock over a two-year term, subject to our election to sell any such shares. We have approximately $8.8 million of remaining availability under the purchase agreement; however, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, the aggregate number of shares that we can issue to Aspire Capital under the purchase agreement may in no case exceed 3,614,766 shares of our common stock (of which we have sold 2.1 million shares as of the date of this report), unless (i) stockholder approval is obtained to issue more, in which case this 3,614,766 share limitation will not apply, or (ii) stockholder approval has not been obtained and at any time the 3,614,766 share limitation is reached and at all times thereafter the average price paid for all shares issued under the purchase agreement (including 300,000 commitment shares issued thereunder) is equal to or greater than $0.95 per share, a price equal to the closing sale price of our common stock on the business day before the execution of the purchase agreement.

	Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
	adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
	Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the
	participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
	internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the
<I>
	Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework
</I>
	(2013) issued by the Committee of
	Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
	designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
	reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
	America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
	and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
	reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)
	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
	permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
	being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
	the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
	timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
	Company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
	statements.

</A>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
	financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
	of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
	that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
	the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
	over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Based on this assessment,
	management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer, determined that as of December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting was effective.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation
	report of the Company&#146;s independent public accounting firm regarding internal
	control over financial reporting. Management&#146;s report was not subject to
	attestation by the Company&#146;s independent public accounting firm pursuant to

	Remediation of Previous Material Weakness
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In connection with the restatement discussed in Note 2 to the
	consolidated financial statements in Amendment No. 2 to the Company's Annual
	Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2014, management
	identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
	internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
	possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
	statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material
	weakness relates to our previous interpretation of ASC 815 and our initial
	classification and subsequent accounting for warrants. This material weakness
	resulted in a misstatement of our liabilities, non-cash expense relating to the
	changes in fair value of common stock warrants, additional paid-in capital,
	accumulated deficit accounts and related financial disclosures. This material
	weakness resulted in the restatement of the Company's consolidated financial
	statements as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and for the years ended December 31,
	2014 and 2013.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company's management believes that this incident was
	related to the interpretation of ASC 815 and specific accounting literature
	under GAAP and is isolated. Management took steps during the fourth quarter of
	2015 to ensure that the Company's accounting staff is knowledgeable about ASC
	815 and its application to the Company. Based on the measures taken and
	implemented, the Company's management has tested the newly implemented control
	activities and found them to be effective and has concluded that the material
	weakness described above has been remediated as of December 31, 2015.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Changes in Internal Controls
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Other than as described under &#147;Remediation of Previous Material
	Weakness&#148; above, there were no changes in the Company&#146;s internal control over
	financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially
	affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
	control over financial reporting.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Lightbridge Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&rsquo; equity, and cash flows for the year then ended.&nbsp; These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lightbridge Corporation at December 31, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company was formed on October 6, 2006, when Thorium Power, Ltd. merged with Thorium Power, Inc., (&ldquo;TPI&rdquo;), which had been formed in the State of Delaware on January 8, 1992. On September 29, 2009, we changed our name from Thorium Power, Ltd. to Lightbridge Corporation (subsequently referred to as &ldquo;we&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;). We are engaged in two operating business segments: our Technology Business Segment and our Consulting Business Segment (see Note 12-Business Segment Results).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Going Concern
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We have incurred recurring losses since inception and expect to
	continue to incur losses as a result of costs and expenses related to our
	research and continued development of our nuclear fuel and our corporate general
	and administrative expenses. Our limited capital resources and operations to
	date have been funded through sales of our equity securities. As of December 31,
	2015, we had working capital of approximately $0.1 million, cash of
	approximately $0.6 million, stockholders&#146; deficit of approximately $1.5 million
	and an accumulated deficit of approximately $74.4 million. As a result, there is
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In the event
	that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities or
	raise additional funds, we may be required to delay, reduce or severely curtail
	our operations or otherwise impede our on-going business efforts, which could
	have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial
	condition and long-term prospects. The Company expects to seek to obtain
	additional funding through future equity issuances. There can be no assurance as
	to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be
	available.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Technology Business Segment
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our primary business segment, based on future revenue
	potential, is to develop and commercialize innovative, proprietary nuclear fuel
	designs which we expect will significantly enhance the nuclear power industry&#146;s
	economics due to higher power output and improve safety margins.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We are currently focusing our development efforts primarily on
	the metallic fuel with a power uprate of up to 10% and a 24-month operating
	cycle in existing Westinghouse-type four-loop pressurized water reactors. Those
	reactors represent the largest segment of our global target market. Our metallic
	fuel could also be adapted for use in other types of water-cooled commercial
	power reactors, such as boiling water reactors, CANDU heavy water reactors, as
	well as water-cooled small modular reactors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On September 9, 2015, we entered into a Comprehensive Nuclear
	Services Agreement with Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) for fabrication of
	Lightbridge's patented next generation metallic nuclear fuel test samples at CNL
	facilities at Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. This enabling agreement provides the
	framework to proceed with Phases 2 and 3 of the test fuel sample fabrication at
	CNL's facilities in Chalk River as envisioned in an October 2014 Initial
	Cooperation Agreement. The initial scope of work under the comprehensive nuclear
	services agreement involves development of a fabrication plan in 2015.
	Subsequent activities will include fabrication and characterization in early
	2016 of prototype fuel test samples using depleted uranium, to be followed by
	fabrication in late 2016 of irradiation fuel test samples using low enriched
	uranium for loop irradiation testing under prototypic commercial reactor
	operating conditions in a pressurized water loop of the 25 MW nuclear research
	reactor operated by the Institute for Energy Technology (&#147;IFE&#148;) at Halden,
	Norway.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On July 8, 2015 we entered into a service agreement with IFE of
	Norway for irradiation testing of Lightbridge advanced metallic nuclear fuel
	samples under prototypic commercial reactor operating conditions in IFE&#146;s Halden
	Research Reactor.

	Consulting Business Segment
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our business model expanded with the establishment of a
	consulting business segment in 2007, through which we provide consulting and
	strategic advisory services to companies and governments planning to create or
	expand electricity generation capabilities using nuclear power plants. On August
	1, 2008, we signed separate consulting services agreements with two government
	entities: Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (&#147;ENEC&#148;) formed by Abu Dhabi, one
	of the member Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (&#147;UAE&#148;), and the Federal
	Authority for Nuclear Regulation (&#147;FANR&#148;) formed by the government of the UAE.
	Under these two original agreements, we have provided consulting and strategic
	advisory services over a contract term of five years starting from June 23,
	2008. The ENEC contract had been extended through 2015. The FANR contract has
	been extended to December 31, 2016. These contracts can each continue to be
	extended upon agreement by both parties.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On August 11, 2014, we were selected to provide quality
	assurance, safety and construction inspection services in support of the
	in-house inspection team of FANR. As a team with Lloyd&#146;s Register, this work is
	in addition to our ongoing support of FANR&#146;s activities.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the fourth quarter of 2014, we signed a contract with
	ENEC to provide management consulting services to their Seoul Korea office, on a
	time and material basis.

	Basis of Consolidation

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
	Lightbridge, a Nevada corporation, and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, TPI, a
	Delaware corporation, Lightbridge International Holding LLC, a Delaware limited
	liability company, and our foreign branch offices.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	All significant intercompany transactions and balances have
	been eliminated in consolidation. We registered a branch office in the United
	Kingdom in 2008 called Lightbridge Advisors Limited (inactive) and we also
	established a branch office in Moscow, Russia, in July 2009, both of which are
	wholly owned by Lightbridge International Holding LLC at December 31, 2015.
	These branch offices will be closed in 2016. Translation gains and losses for
	the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not significant. Foreign
	branches are winding down as of December 31, 2015.

	Use of Estimates and Assumptions
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
	liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
	revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates.

<B>
<I>
	Significant Estimates
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	These accompanying consolidated financial statements include
	some amounts that are based on management&#146;s best estimates and judgments. The
	most significant estimates relate to valuation of stock grants and stock
	options, derivative liability for the stock purchase warrants, the valuation
	allowance on deferred tax assets, and various contingent liabilities. It is
	reasonably possible that these above-mentioned estimates and others may be
	adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment could
	be significant in future reporting periods. It is also reasonably possible that
	the actual grant date value of the stock options vested might have been
	materially different than the estimated value.

<I>
	Fair Value of Financial Instruments
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist principally of cash
	and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and derivative
	warrant liabilities. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that
	would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
	transaction between unaffiliated market participants. Assets and liabilities
	measured at fair value are categorized based on whether the inputs are
	observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The
	categorization of financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy is based
	on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
	The fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities were determined based on
	&#147;Level 3&#148; inputs. See note 10 for more information on the Level 3 inputs and
	valuation of the derivative warrant liability and note 13 for more information
	on fair value measurements.

<I>
	Certain Risks, Uncertainties and
	Concentrations
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We are an early stage company and will likely need additional
	funding by way of strategic alliances, further offerings of equity securities,
	an offering of debt securities, or a financing through a bank in order to
	support the remaining research and development activities required to further
	enhance and complete the development of our fuel products to a commercial stage.
	Currently, we are working on consulting revenue opportunities with the overall
	goal of increasing our profitability and cash flow.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We participate in a government-regulated industry. Our
	operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors including decreases
	in the use or public favor of nuclear power, the ability of our technology to
	safeguard the production of nuclear power and our ability to safeguard our
	patents and intellectual property from competitors. Due to these factors, we may
	experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our future operating
	results. Potentially, a loss of a key officer, key management, and other
	personnel could impair our ability to successfully execute our business
	strategy, particularly when these individuals have acquired specialized
	knowledge and skills with respect to nuclear power and our operations.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our future operations and earnings currently depend on the
	results of the Company&#146;s operations outside the United States. There can be no
	assurance that the Company will be able to successfully continue to conduct such
	operations, and a failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the
	Company&#146;s research and development activities, financial position, results of
	operations, and cash flows. Also, the success of the Company&#146;s operations will
	be subject to other numerous contingencies, some of which are beyond
	management&#146;s control. These contingencies include general and regional economic
	conditions, competition, changes in regulations, changes in accounting and
	taxation standards, inability to achieve overall long-term goals, future
	impairment charges and global or regional catastrophic events. Because the
	Company is dependent on its international operations for almost all its revenue,
	the Company may be subject to various additional political, economic, and other
	uncertainties.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are primarily
	derived from revenues earned from customers located in the Middle East. We
	perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount
	of credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our
	customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses if necessary,
	however, no reserve has been set up at December 31, 2015 and 2014, as we have
	not incurred any credit losses from our customers to date.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Approximately 56% and 81% of the total revenues reported for
	the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were from the ENEC and

	The Company accounts for stock warrants as either equity

	warrant agreement. Stock warrants are accounted for as a derivative in
	accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging
	(&#147;ASC 815&#148;) if the stock warrants contain terms that could potentially require
	&#147;net cash settlement&#148; and therefore, do not meet the scope exception for
	treatment as a derivative. Warrant instruments that could potentially require
	&#147;net cash settlement&#148; in the absence of express language precluding such
	settlement are initially classified as derivative liabilities at their estimated
	fair values, regardless of the likelihood that such instruments will ever be
	settled in cash. The Company will continue to classify the fair value of the
	warrants that contain &#147;net cash settlement&#148; as a liability until the warrants
	are exercised, expire or are amended in a way that would no longer require these warrants to be classified as a liability. For

	Commitments and Contingencies

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain
	conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are
	issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be
	resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company
	assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an
	exercise of judgment.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is
	probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
	can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company&#146;s
	consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a
	potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably
	possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the
	contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if
	determinable and material, would be disclosed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not
	disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be
	disclosed. The Company&#146;s legal costs associated with contingent liabilities are

	right to exercise sufficient control to establish an employer-employee
	relationship based on common law as illustrated in case law and currently under

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Leases &#150; In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 which
	amends existing lease accounting guidance, including the requirement to
	recognize most lease arrangements on the balance sheet. The adoption of this
	standard will result in the Company recognizing a right-of-use asset
	representing its rights to use the underlying asset for the lease term with an
	offsetting lease liability. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is
	currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this accounting
	pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, &#147;Balance
	Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes&#148;, which simplifies the presentation of
	deferred income taxes. This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and
	liabilities be classified&nbsp;on a net basis as non-current in a statement of financial position.
	Adoption of this ASU did not have an effect on our deferred tax assets and
	deferred tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,

	Consolidation

	&#151; In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU
	No. 2015-02, &#147;Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation
	Analysis&#148;. This will improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for
	reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate
	certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability
	corporations, and securitization structures. ASU 2015-02 simplified and improves
	GAAP by: eliminating the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a
	limited partnership, eliminating the indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No.
	167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation
	models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model),
	and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include
	in the consolidation of VIEs. ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods
	beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the
	potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on its financial statements.

	Going Concern
</I>
	&#151; In August 2014, FASB issued guidance
	that requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an
	entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the
	financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if
	conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to
	continue as a going concern. The updated accounting guidance will be effective
	for the Company on December 31, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The
	Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this guidance upon
	adoption.

<I>
	Revenue Recognition
</I>
	&mdash; In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity&rsquo;s contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, (early adoption is permitted but not sooner than the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the revenue recognition provisions in this guidance upon adoption.

	Note 2. Net Loss Per Share

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average
	number of common shares outstanding during the period except that it does not
	include unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Diluted
	net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common
	shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period.
	Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon
	the exercise of stock options, warrants, restricted shares, and unvested common
	shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. The dilutive effect of outstanding
	stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and warrants is not
	reflected in diluted earnings per share because we incurred net losses for the
	years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the effect of including these
	potential common shares in the diluted earnings per share calculations would be
	anti-dilutive and are therefore not included in the calculations.

	December 17, 2015 we entered into a sublease agreement for this prior office
	space with a third party with a lease term starting January 1, 2016 to February
	28, 2018. The average monthly rent to be received under this sub-lease is
	approximately $15,000 per month, over the sub-lease term. The present value of
	the negative cash flows over this sub-lease term is approximately $433,000 and
	this amount plus a real estate commission paid to find the sub-lease tenant of
	approximately $20,000, resulted in a total $453,000 that was recognized as an
	abandonment loss. This total was recorded under general and administrative
	expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. The long-term portion of deferred

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our former Chief Financial Officer filed a complaint against
	the Company and Seth Grae, President and Chief Executive Officer, with the
	Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia (the &#147;Fairfax County Complaint&#148;), and
	a separate complaint against the Company with the U.S. Occupational Safety and
	Health Administration (the &#147;OSHA Complaint&#148;) on March 9, 2015.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Fairfax County Complaint contained two claims for damages.
	The first claim alleged that the Company and Mr. Grae made defamatory statements
	regarding the former Chief Financial Officer. The claim demands at least
	$1,000,000 in compensatory damages; costs, including reasonable fees for
	attorneys; and punitive damages of $1,000,000. The second claim alleges that the
	Company breached the former Chief Financial Officer&#146;s employment contract by not
	paying the former Chief Financial Officer $15,507 for paid time off, and demands
	additional compensatory damages of at least $15,507.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In November 2015, subsequent to the above Fairfax County
	Complaint being filed, our legal counsel was notified by the attorney
	representing the former Chief Financial Officer that the former Chief Financial
	Officer has voluntarily decided to nonsuit the above Fairfax County Complaint on
	November 30, 2015. A nonsuit is essentially a voluntary dismissal of the case
	without prejudice, meaning that he is dismissing the case but that he can refile
	the suit at a later time. The statute for refiling this case is approximately 6
	months from the filing date of this nonsuit.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The OSHA Complaint alleges that the Company unlawfully
	retaliated against the former Chief Financial Officer for challenging allegedly
	improper actions of the Company by making allegedly defamatory statements and
	terminating him from his employment with the Company. The former Chief Financial
	Officer&#146;s demand for damages is for back pay, front pay, and special damages.
	The complaint did not specify the amount of damages sought.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company believes that all of the above claims by the former
	Chief Financial Officer are without merit and intends to vigorously defend
	itself. As of December 31, 2015, legal fees of $105,046 were incurred that are
	expected to be paid by the Company&#146;s insurance carrier.

	respectively. We shut down our Moscow office operations as of January 1, 2015

	On October 20, 2014, we announced the signing of an initial
	cooperation agreement with Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (&#147;CNL&#148;), a wholly owned
	subsidiary of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, for fabrication and test reactor
	irradiation of Lightbridge&#146;s patented next generation metallic nuclear fuel
	samples. Though we had initially planned for all of the work to take place at a
	single location in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada, subsequent to our announcement
	the Canadian government made an official decision to extend the operating life
	of the National Research Universal reactor at Chalk River only until the end of
	March 2018. This shorter than expected operating life extension would not be
	able to accommodate all of our entire anticipated schedule for irradiation testing of our metallic fuel samples.
	Consequently, our plan is to work with CNL on fabrication of our fuel samples at
	their Chalk River facilities, with full irradiation of the fabricated fuel
	samples to be performed separately in a pressurized water loop of the Halden
	Research Reactor located in Halden, Norway. The operating license of the Halden
	Research Reactor has recently been renewed through 2020 which fits well with our
	anticipated irradiation testing schedule. Our current plan is to have
	post-irradiation examination of the irradiated fuel samples performed on the
	same site in Norway and nearby hot cell facilities located in Studsvik, Sweden
	that are operated by the Swedish company Studsvik AB.

	metallic nuclear fuel test samples at CNL facilities at Chalk River, Ontario,
	Canada. This enabling agreement provides the framework to proceed with Phases 2
	and 3 of the test fuel sample fabrication at CNL&#146;s facilities in Chalk River as
	envisioned in an October 2014 Initial Cooperation Agreement. The initial scope
	of work under the comprehensive nuclear services agreement involves development

	preliminary plan for fabrication of Lightbridge-designed partial length nuclear
	fuel samples at BWXT facilities in the United States. This arrangement can

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On July 8, 2015, we announced the signing of an Umbrella
	Services Agreement with the Institute for Energy Technology (&#147;IFE&#148;) of Norway
	for irradiation testing of Lightbridge advanced metallic nuclear fuel samples
	under prototypic commercial reactor operating conditions in IFE's Halden
	Research Reactor, southeast of Oslo. The project's pre-irradiation scope
	includes irradiation-rig mechanical design, detailed neutronic and
	thermal-hydraulic calculations, and safety analyses with necessary regulatory
	approvals. The initial phase of irradiation testing is expected to begin in 2017
	and continue for about three years to reach the burnup necessary for insertion
	of lead test assemblies (LTAs) in a commercial power reactor. The final phase of
	irradiation testing necessary for batch reloads and full cores operating with a
	10% power uprate and a 24-month cycle is expected to take an additional two
	years and be completed while LTAs have begun operating in the core of a
	commercial power reactor. The IFE umbrella services agreement is valid for 10
	years.

	Note 9. Income Taxes

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our tax provision is determined using an estimate of our annual
	effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into
	account in the relevant period. The 2015 and 2014 annual effective tax rate is
	estimated to be a combined 38% for the U.S. federal and state statutory tax
	rates. We review tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances
	and adjust them accordingly. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no tax
	contingencies or unrecognized tax positions recorded.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
	differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recognized
	for financial reporting, and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes. The
	significant components of deferred tax assets (at a 38% effective tax rate) as
	of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are as follows:

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We have a net operating loss carry-forward for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $49.4 million at December 31, 2015, that is potentially available to offset future taxable income, which will begin to expire in the year 2021. For financial reporting purposes, no deferred tax asset was recognized because at December 31, 2015 and 2014, management estimates that it is more likely than not that substantially all of the net operating losses will expire unused. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The timing and manner in which we can utilize our net operating loss carryforward and future income tax deductions in any year may be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the change in ownership of corporations. Such limitation may have an impact on the ultimate realization of our carryforwards and future tax deductions. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (&ldquo;Section 382&rdquo;) imposes limitations on a corporation&rsquo;s ability to utilize net operating losses if it experiences an &ldquo;ownership change.&rdquo; In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in assets held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change. Upon review of the ownership shifts, there has not been an ownership change as defined under Section 382.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable was reduced 100% by a valuation allowance. The change in the valuation allowance was approximately $1.4 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The excess tax benefits of approximately $0.2 million associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders' equity only when realized. Many of the Company&rsquo;s operating expenses in its 2007 and 2006 tax years were classified under the Internal Revenue Code as capitalized &ldquo;Startup Costs&rdquo;, which did not begin to be deductible for tax purposes until 2008. The Company files a consolidated tax return with its subsidiaries. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2011, except that earlier years can be examined for the sole purpose of challenging the net operating loss carry-forwards arising in those years.

	Note 10. Warrant Liability
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our outstanding warrants are recorded as liabilities at their
	estimated fair value at the date of issuance, with the subsequent changes in
	estimated fair value recorded in other income (expense) in the Company&#146;s
	statement of operations in each subsequent quarterly period. The change in the
	estimated fair value of our warrant liability for the years ended December 31,
	2015 and 2014 resulted in non-cash income of approximately $2.3 million and
	non-cash income of approximately $1.2 million, respectively. The Company
	utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method to value the liability
	classified warrants.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The estimated fair value of these warrants is determined using
	Level 3 inputs. Inherent in the Monte Carlo valuation model are assumptions
	related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest
	rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common
	stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of
	the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
	zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected
	remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be
	equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on
	the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero.

	On September 4, 2015, we entered into an equity purchase

	and warrants were sold in fixed combinations, with each combination consisting
	of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.95 shares of common
	stock. The purchase price was $1.75 per fixed combination. The warrants became

	on May 18, 2015, and will remain exercisable for seven-and-a-half years from the
	date of issuance at an exercise price of $2.31 per share. The exercise price of
	the warrants is subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits, stock
	dividends, combinations of shares, and similar recapitalization transactions.
	The exercisability of the warrants may be limited if, upon exercise, the holder
	or any of its affiliates would beneficially own more than 4.99% of the Company's

	These stock options have an expected life of 1.5 -5 years, and

	Under this method, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the

	On April 8, 2015, August 12, 2015, and November 20, 2015, the
	Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors granted long term incentive
	stock options totaling 550,972, 79,588, and 661,222 respectively, under the 2015
	Equity Incentive Plan, the (&#147;Plan&#148;) to employees and consultants of the Company.
	These stock options vest 1/3 on each annual anniversary date over three years.
	These stock options have a strike price ranging from $0.92 to $1.26, and the
	stock options have a fair value ranging from $0.67 to $0.91, based on a risk
	free rate of between 1.55% and 1.87%, volatility between 86% and 87%, and an
	expected life of six years, as measured on the grant date. The expected life is
	calculated using the simplified method as we do not have sufficient historical
	option data to provide a better estimate of the expected option term. These
	options have a 10 year contractual term. The risk free rate was based on the US
	Treasury Yield Curve for the expected life of the options on the grant date.
	Expected dividends are estimated at $0.0, as we have never issued dividends and
	we have no current plans to issue dividends in the future. Grants to our
	consultants were remeasured as of December 31, 2015, and the fair value of each
	option was between $0.69 and $0.72 on the measurement date. This re-measured stock option expense for
	options issued to consultants was not significant. We estimated future pre-vest
	forfeitures to be 1.5%, based on historical information.

	Equity Incentive Plan to the Board of Directors of the Company. These stock

	stock options have a strike price between $0.92 and $1.26, and the stock options
	have a fair value of between $0.65 to $0.88, based on a risk free rate between
	1.46% and 1.79%, volatility between 86% and 87%, and an expected life of 5.5

	2014 Stock Option Grants
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On May 5, 2014, we granted 579,429 stock options to our
	employees, directors, and consultants. These stock options vest over three years
	for employees and consultants, and over one year for our directors. The fair
	value of each option was $1.79 on the grant date, based on (1) The strike price
	of $2.55, the price of our stock at the close of the market on the grant date;
	(2) The expected life of the grant of 5 years which is equal to the term of the
	grant, as historically grants have only been exercised just before the term
	expires; (3) The risk free rate of 1.68% which is based on the treasury yield
	curve for a 5 year term as published by the U.S. Treasury for the grant date;
	(4) Volatility of 90.44%, as measured based on the expected life of the options,
	and (5) Expected dividends of $0.0, as we have never issued dividends and we
	have no current plans to issue dividends in the future. Grants to our
	consultants were re-measured as of December 31, 2015, and the fair value of each
	option was $0.52 on the measurement date. The re-measured stock option expense
	for options issued to consultants was not significant. We estimated future
	pre-vest forfeitures to be 1.5%, based on historical information.

	We use the historical volatility of our stock price over the
	number of years that matches the expected life of our stock option grants or we
	use the historical volatility of our stock price since January 5, 2006, the date
	we announced that we were becoming a public company, to estimate the future
	volatility of our stock. At this time we do not believe that there is a better
	objective method to predict the future volatility of our stock for options with
	an expected term that is greater than our stock trading history. Prior to
	January 1, 2015, we estimated the life of our option awards based on the full
	contractual term of the option grant. To date we have had very few exercises of
	our option grants, and those stock option exercises had occurred just before the
	contractual expiration dates of the option awards. Since the strike price of
	most of our outstanding awards is greater than the price of our stock, generally
	awards have expired at the end of the contractual term. For options granted
	after January 1, 2015, we have applied the simplified method to estimate the
	expected term of our option grants as it is more likely that these options may
	be exercised prior to the end of the term. We estimate the effect of future
	forfeitures of our option grants based on an analysis of historical forfeitures
	of unvested grants, as we have no better objective basis for that estimate. The
	expense that we have recognized related to our grants includes the estimate for
	future pre-vest forfeitures. We will adjust the actual expense recognized due to
	future pre-vest forfeitures as they occur. We have estimated that 1.5% of our
	option grants will be forfeited prior to vesting.

	Annually, the board of directors assess and approve the fair
	value measurement policies and procedures. At least annually, the finance
	department determines if the current valuation techniques used in the fair value
	measurements are still appropriate and evaluates and adjusts the unobservable
	inputs used in the fair value measurements based on current market conditions
	and third-party information. The following fair value hierarchy table presents
	information about each major category of the Company&#146;s financial liability
	measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and

	The fair value of the warrant liability is based on Level 3
	inputs. For this liability, the Company developed its own assumptions that do
	not have observable inputs or available market data to support the fair value.
	See Note 10 for further discussion of the warrant liability. Significant
	increases (decreases) in any of those Level 3 inputs in isolation would result
	in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We believe that the fair values of its current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3.

	On March 14, 2016, we entered into a joint development agreement (&ldquo;JD&rdquo;) with AREVA NP (&ldquo;Areva&rdquo;) to develop a joint business plan to evaluate the technical, economic, and strategic feasibility and desirability of the parties&rsquo; forming one or more joint venture companies to further develop, manufacture, and commercialize the Company&rsquo;s metallic nuclear fuel technology. The JD agreement includes a statement of work whereby the Company is expected to pay a total of approximately $141,000 toward the total cost of work to be performed as part of the Joint Evaluation Project Plan by placing a work release or purchase order with Areva. The total amount is due and payable by the Company as follows: 40% of the total amount due upon the effective date of the signing of the JD; 30% of the total amount due upon the delivery of an intermediate report by Areva and the remaining 30% due upon the delivery of the final report to the Company.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	1. I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K of
	Lightbridge Corporation;

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any
	untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
	statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	4. The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are
	responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
	(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control
	over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
	controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
	material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
	subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
	during the period in which this report is being prepared;
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
	Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal
	control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to
	provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles;
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.
	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
	procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
	of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered
	by this report based on such evaluation; and
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Disclosed in this report any
	change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that
	occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's
	fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially

	internal control over financial reporting.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	5. The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have
	disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
	financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the
	registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
	functions):
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
