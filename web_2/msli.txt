	This Annual Report and the documents incorporated by reference
	herein contain certain statements or disclosures that may constitute
	forward-looking information or statements (collectively, &#147;forward-looking

	other than those of historical fact, which address activities, events, outcomes,
	results or developments that management of our company, as applicable,
	anticipates or expects may or will occur in the future (in whole or in part)
	should be considered forward-looking information. In some cases, forward-looking
	information can be identified by terms such as &#147;forecast&#148;, &#147;future&#148;, &#147;may&#148;,
	&#147;will&#148;, &#147;expect&#148;, &#147;anticipate&#148;, &#147;believe&#148;, &#147;could&#148;, &#147;potential&#148;, &#147;enable&#148;,
	&#147;plan, &#147;continue&#148;, &#147;contemplate&#148;, &#147;pro forma&#148; or other comparable terminology.
	Forward-looking information presented in such statements or disclosures may,

	expenditures, including general and administrative expenses, and the sources of
	the financing thereof; expectations regarding the ability to raise capital;
	movements in currency exchange rates; anticipated income taxes; our business
	outlook; plans and objectives of management for future operations; forecast
	business results; and anticipated financial performance.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Various assumptions or factors are typically applied in drawing
	conclusions or making the forecasts or projections set out in forward-looking
	information. Those assumptions and factors are based on information currently
	available to our company, including information obtained from third-party
	industry analysts and other third party sources. In some instances, material
	assumptions and factors are presented or discussed elsewhere in this Annual
	Report in connection with the statements or disclosure containing the
	forward-looking information.

	Risk Factors Associated with the our Business
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	We may not be able to implement our strategy to grow our
	business and expand our revenues.
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We have historically increased sales and net income through
	strategic acquisitions, licensing and related internal growth initiatives
	intended to develop marketing opportunities with respect to acquired product
	lines. Our strategy is focused on increasing sales and enhancing our competitive
	standing and enabling us to promote and sell new products through existing and
	new marketing and distribution channels. Since we engage in limited proprietary
	research activity with respect to product development, we rely heavily on
	purchasing product lines from other companies. Other companies, many of which
	have substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources than us, may
	compete for the acquisition of products. We may not be able to acquire rights to
	additional products on acceptable terms, if at all, or be able to obtain future
	financing for acquisition on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to
	effect acquisitions of additional branded products could limit the overall
	growth of our business. Furthermore, even if we are able to obtain rights to
	pharmaceutical products, we may not generate sales sufficient to create a profit
	or otherwise avoid a loss. For example, the marketing strategy, distribution
	channels and levels of competition with respect to acquired products may be
	different than those of our current products, limiting our ability to compete
	favourably in those product categories.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	If we are not able to acquire the license rights to new
	products, we may not be able to execute our business strategy and generate
	revenues as planned.
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We depend on acquisition of rights to products from other
	companies as the primary source for new products. Risks in acquiring new
	products include: (a) the ability to locate new products that are attractive and
	complement our business, and (b) the price to acquire or obtain the license for
	these products may be too costly to justify the acquisition. We also face
	competition from other pharmaceutical companies in acquiring rights to products,
	which makes it more difficult to find attractive products on acceptable
	terms.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and is
	subject to rapid and significant technological change, which could render our
	technologies and products obsolete or uncompetitive.
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our products will face competition from new pharmaceutical and
	biotech products that treat some of the same diseases and conditions as our
	products. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources and selling
	and marketing capabilities. We will face further competition from
	drug development companies that focus their efforts on developing and marketing
	products that are similar in nature to our products, but that in some instances
	offer improvements over our products, such as less frequent dosing, more
	pleasant taste, new dosage formats and other novel approaches to improve
	existing products. Our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and
	products that are more effective or less expensive to use than any that we may
	license or acquire. These developments could render our products obsolete or
	uncompetitive, which would have a material adverse effect on our business,
	financial condition and operating results.

	Core patent protection for our initial portfolio has expired
	or will expire in the future, which could result in significant competition from
	generic products resulting in a significant reduction in sales.
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The core patents protecting our Vancocin&#174; products expired on
	July 13, 2010 and the core patents protecting our ENABLEX products expire in
	August 2016, which could result in significant competition from generic products
	and could result in a significant reduction in sales. In such situations, in
	order to continue to obtain commercial benefits from our products, we will rely
	on product manufacturing trade secrets, know-how and related non-patent
	intellectual property. The effect of this patent expiration depends, among other
	things, upon the nature of the market and the position of our products in the
	market from time to time, the growth of the market, the complexities and
	economics of manufacture of a competitive product and regulatory approval
	requirements of generic drug laws. In the event that competition develops from
	generic products, this competition could have a material adverse effect on our
	business, financial condition and operating results. The entrance into the
	market of a generic pharmaceutical product may erode the branded product&#146;s
	market share which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
	condition and results of operations. In December 2011, Health Canada granted a
	notice of compliance (&#147;NOC&#148;) to Pharmaceutical Partners of Canada Inc. (&#147;PPC&#148;),
	which grants PPC the authority to market their generic version of Vancocin
	capsules in the Canadian market. In July 2012, PPC confirmed its intentions to
	market a generic Vancomycin capsule product and in November 2012 gained
	reimbursement listing status in a number of provinces. The entry of this generic
	product has had a material adverse effect on the sales of Merus&#146; branded
	Vancocin capsules and other existing and future market entrants may also have a
	material adverse effect on sales.

	We may not be able to protect and maintain our intellectual

</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect and
	maintain intellectual property rights and licensing arrangements for our
	products. No assurance can be given that the licenses or rights used by our
	company will not be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or that
	the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to our
	company. Any loss of intellectual property protection is likely to adversely
	affect our operating results. Our commercial success will also depend in part on
	us not infringing patents or proprietary rights of others and not breaching the
	licenses granted to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain
	a license to any third party technology that it may be required to conduct our
	business or that such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost. There is
	no certainty that we will not be challenged by our partners for non-compliance
	with our existing or future licensing arrangements. Consequently, there may be a
	risk that licensing arrangements are withdrawn with no compensation or penalties
	to us.

	We may be subject to product liability claims, which can be
	expensive, difficult to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements.
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The administration of drugs to humans, whether in clinical
	trials or after marketing clearance is obtained, can result in product liability
	claims. Product liability claims can be expensive, difficult to defend and may
	result in large judgments or settlements against our company. In addition, third
	party collaborators and licensees may not protect us from product liability
	claims.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We will maintain product liability insurance in connection with
	the marketing of our products. Merus may not be able to obtain or maintain
	adequate protection against potential liabilities arising from product sales. If
	Merus is unable to obtain sufficient levels of insurance at acceptable cost or
	otherwise protect against potential product liability claims Merus will be
	exposed to product liability claims. A successful product liability claim in
	excess of its insurance coverage could harm its financial condition, results of
	operations and prevent or interfere with its product commercialization efforts.
	In addition, any successful claim may prevent Merus from obtaining adequate
	product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable
	terms. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such a claim may be
	time-consuming and expensive and would result in Merus needing to divert
	resources which could otherwise be used in developing its business.

	We have incurred significant liabilities in connection with the

	when due and payable. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure
	future additional financing to repay our current debt facility or our
	outstanding convertible debentures should cash flows from operations be

	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the

	In both domestic and foreign markets, the formulation,

	intent to sell an unapproved new drug. If any such evidence is found with
	respect to our products, the FDA may take adverse action against us, ranging
	from a warning letter necessitating cessation of use of the statement to
	injunctions against product sale, seizures of products promoted with the

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We may be exposed to fluctuations of the Canadian dollar
	against certain other currencies because we publishes our financial statements
	in Canadian dollars, while a portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and
	costs are or will be denominated in other currencies, such as the euro and the
	U.S. dollar. Exchange rates for currencies of the countries in which we operate
	may fluctuate in relation to the Canadian dollar, and such fluctuations,
	especially as between the Canadian dollar, U.S. dollar and the euro, may have a
	material adverse effect on its earnings or assets when translating foreign
	currency into Canadian dollars. In order to mitigate the risk, we have used, in
	the past, forward contracts and other derivative instruments to reduce our
	exposure to foreign currency risk and may or may not do so in the future.
	Dependent on the nature, amount and timing of foreign currency receipts and
	payments, we may from time-to-time enter into foreign currency contracts.
	Accordingly, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings
	solely as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which include foreign
	currency devaluations against the Canadian dollar. We do not typically carry

</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
	Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and
	maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
	control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
	assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
	of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. Internal
	control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
	financial reporting objectives due to its inherent limitations. Internal control
	over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and
	compliance and is therefore subject to error, collusion, or improper override.
	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not
	be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and although it is possible to
	incorporate into the financial reporting process safeguards to reduce this risk,
	they cannot be guaranteed to entirely eliminate it. If we fail to maintain
	effective internal control over financial reporting, then there is an increased
	risk of an error in our financial statements that could result in us being
	required to restate previously issued financial statements at a later date.

	Risks Relating to our Common Shares
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	There are unexercised share purchase warrants and stock

	Common Shares will be diluted.
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As of November 30, 2013, there were 38,391,512 Common Shares
	issued. If all of the share purchase warrants and options that were issued and
	outstanding as of that date were to be exercised, including warrants and options
	that are not yet exercisable, Merus would be required to issue up to an
	additional 4,760,950 Common Shares, or approximately 12% of Merus&#146; issued and
	outstanding Common Shares as of November 30, 2013. In addition, if the option to
	convert the outstanding convertible debentures was exercised, we would be
	required to issue an additional 6,666,666 shares or approximately 17% of our
	issued and outstanding Common Shares. These issuances would substantially
	decrease the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders.
	This dilution could cause the price of our Common Shares to decline and it could
	result in the creation of new control persons. In addition, our stockholders
	could suffer dilution in the net book value per share.

	A decline in the price of the Common Shares could affect our

</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A prolonged decline in the price of the Common Shares could
	result in a reduction in the liquidity of our Common Shares and a reduction in
	our ability to raise capital. Because a significant portion of our operations
	have been and will be financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline
	in the price of our Common Shares could be especially detrimental to our
	liquidity and our operations. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds
	from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our
	business plan and operations, including its ability to acquire new products and
	continue its current operations. If our stock price declines, we can offer no
	assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms
	or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are
	unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not have the resources
	to continue our normal operations.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	Because we can issue additional Common Shares, holders of
	our Common Shares may incur immediate dilution and may experience further

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We are authorized to issue an unlimited number of Common
	Shares, of which 38,391,512 shares were issued and outstanding as of November
	30, 2013 and an unlimited number of Preferred Shares, of which none were issued
	and outstanding as of November 30, 2013. Our board of directors has the
	authority to cause us to issue additional Common Shares without the consent of
	any of our stockholders. Consequently, the stockholders may experience more
	dilution in their ownership of the Common Shares in the future.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	Because it is unlikely that we will pay dividends in the

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We have never paid dividends on our Common Shares and we do not
	intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any future

	anticipates the need for current dividends from his or her investment should not
	purchase Common Shares.

	PDL

	BioPharma. US$35 million of this amount was drawn down upon acquisition of the
	asset with a further US$20 million guaranteed through a letter of credit
	facility. We paid the balance of the purchase price from cash on hand, of which,
	US$4 million had been paid as a deposit at June 30, 2012. The PDL BioPharma loan
	bore interest at 13.5% per annum, with monthly interest payments and periodic
	principal repayments until maturity on March 31, 2015. We used the unpaid
	balance of the credit facility to repay the $20 million Novartis VTB Note at

	On August 26, 2013, we sold the North American rights to

	the license to the FACTIVE&#174; trademark and patent, inventory on hand, various
	contingent liabilities, and certain related intellectual property and other
	information and materials required to market the brand in the North American
	market. The gross proceeds from the divestiture are comprised of a cash payment
	of US$2.2 million paid on closing, a non-contingent deferred cash payment of
	US$800,000 to be paid in quarterly instalments over the next 15 months, and 3
	million shares of OKNV. We determined to sell our rights due to the inherent
	challenges associated with the product and the need for additional investment.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On September 24, 2013, we entered into a new senior secured
	debt facility with a syndicate of Canadian chartered banks. We used the proceeds
	of the new facility, in combination with the convertible debenture described
	below, to repay the Company's credit facility with PDL BioPharma at a lower rate
	and extended term. The new facility matures September 30, 2016 and provides for
	a $30 million term loan, currently at prime plus 3.0%, with monthly payments of
	principal and interest. Principal payments are $700,000 per month for the first
	24 months, increasing to $1,100,000 per month for the final 12 months. The
	facility also provides for up to $2 million on a revolving line of credit, based
	on eligible accounts receivable. In connection with this refinancing, the
	Company issued convertible debentures with a principal value of $10,000,000 to
	two investment funds. The debentures have a term of five years, maturing
	September 20, 2018, with interest at 8.0%, payable quarterly. The principal
	amount of the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a
	fixed rate of $1.50 per common share, with an option for the Company to force
	conversion if its common shares trade at, or above, $2.30 per share for 20
	consecutive days. The facility is secured by all assets of the Company and
	contains affirmative and negative covenants including compliance with laws and
	restrictions on additional debt, as well as financial covenants such as debt to
	earnings and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Company was in compliance with
	all covenants of the senior secured facility as at September 30, 2013.

	B. Business Overview
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During 2011, we made a decision to deploy our capital through
	an amalgamation with Old Merus. We now operate as just one segment relating to
	our specialty pharma business, under the name &#147;Merus Labs International Inc.&#148;
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Merus is a specialty pharmaceutical company that acquires
	prescription medicines in the following categories:
</P>
<UL STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN: JUSTIFY">
<LI>
<P>
	on patent but at maturity stage of product life cycle;
</P>
<LI>
<P>
	branded generics;
</P>
<LI>
<P>
	under promoted products;
</P>
<LI>
<P>
	niche market pharmaceuticals; and
</P>
<LI>
<P>
	products with annual sales below critical threshold for large pharma.
</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Once a product is acquired, our experienced team implements a
	focused sales and marketing plan to promote the product with the goal of
	increasing sales and market share. Our corporate growth strategy is driven by a
	product acquisition plan which employs an opportunistic approach to source
	product acquisition candidates. This approach allows us to source pharmaceutical
	products across broad therapeutic classes which provides access to acquisition
	targets not available to other players and creates a diversified strategy.
	Although we have a broad therapeutic focus, opportunities will be pursued if the
	application of a dedicated small scale sales force can deliver incremental
	product sales growth. The geographic focus is the United States, Canada, and
	Europe. Our corporate strategy results in a diversified product portfolio
	approach. To manage such a product portfolio, a low cost operating model has
	been implemented in which there is a light infrastructure footprint. We have
	partnered with third party contract manufacturing and regulatory service
	providers to leverage their expertise but still maintain maximum flexibility.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Superior Business Model for Acquisition of Diversified
	Legacy Products
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We believe that we have a unique strategy in seeking to acquire
	legacy products primarily for the purpose of generating a stream of stable
	revenues and cash flow. We believe that this strategy will provide us with the
	flexibility to consider a broad range of acquisition targets from a variety of
	therapeutic areas. Therefore, the potential number of product acquisition
	candidates may be much larger for us than for our competitors. Management
	believes that our approach to product acquisition and our return objectives
	provide us with a competitive advantage in acquiring products as we can often
	purchase diversified bundles of products from a single vendor. In contrast, our
	competitors, such as niche pharmaceutical companies, are more likely to focus on
	individual product acquisition within the same therapeutic area. As a result,
	certain vendors may view us as a preferred purchasing candidate.

	Predictable Cost Structure

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our plan to establish a predictable cost structure by relying
	on a small employee base and outsourcing more of the operational functions
	associated with its business, including warehousing, distribution, customer
	service, invoicing, collections, regulatory affairs, medical and drug

	We will rely on a combination of regulatory and patent and

	We will rely on patent protection for products that we acquire in order to
	provide protection from generic pharmaceutical products during the remaining
	life of patents that apply to the products that we acquire. A patent is the
	grant of a property right which allows its holder to exclude others from, among

	Our Competitors
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Competitors in the pharmaceutical market range from large
	multinational pharmaceutical development corporations to small, single product
	companies that may limit their activities to a particular therapeutic area or
	region or territory. Competition also comes from generic companies, which
	develop and commercialize formulations that are identical to marketed brands. We
	expect to compete with a variety of drug companies. However, the initial
	portfolio is comprised of products with several years of remaining patent life
	or established brands.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	With respect to its acquisition strategy, we expect to compete
	principally with other pharmaceutical companies who seek to acquire mature
	pharmaceutical products as part of their growth strategy. These companies,
	however, typically focus on under-promoted products in specific therapeutic
	niches that offer growth potential through synergistic sales and marketing
	efforts. To our knowledge, few, if any, companies are currently seeking to
	acquire legacy products solely for the purpose of generating a stream of
	consistent cash flow. In addition, since we are not focused on specific
	therapeutic classes, we will have the ability to purchase diversified products
	and product bundles.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic
	pharmaceutical products when patents covering certain of our currently marketed
	products expire or are successfully challenged. Generic versions are generally
	significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be
	required in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement
	programs, or substituted by pharmacies. If competitors introduce new products,
	delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products
	can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or
	both. Most products that we acquire must compete with other products already on
	the market or products that are later developed by competitors. Manufacturers of
	generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development
	than research-based pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their
	products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded
	product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price
	competition from generic forms of the product. Our Vancocin product faces
	generic competition in Canada, as discussed below.

	Overactive bladder occurs when a large muscle in the bladder
	known as the detrusor contracts more often than normal. This causes a person to
	feel a sudden and sometimes overwhelming urge to urinate even when the bladder
	isn&#146;t full. Urgency, incontinence, and urinary frequency can also be caused by
	urinary-tract infections, kidney stones, prostate infection or enlargement, or
	medicine taken to treat other conditions such as high blood pressure. Though not
	life-threatening, overactive bladder is inconvenient, can be embarrassing, and
	can markedly reduce quality of life.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	According to an article published in the Reviews of Urology by
	the Department of Urology, New York University School of Medicine, in women,
	moderate and severe bother have a prevalence ranging from about 3% to 17%.
	Severe incontinence has a low prevalence in young women, but rapidly increases
	at ages 70 through 80. In men, the prevalence of incontinence is much lower than
	in women, about 3% to 11% overall, with urge incontinence accounting for 40% to
	80% of all male patients. Incontinence in men also increases with age, but
	severe incontinence in 70- to 80-year-old men is about half of that in women.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Decision Resources, an advisory firm for pharmaceutical and
	healthcare issues, finds that although more than 50 percent of people with
	overactive bladder in the world&#146;s major pharmaceutical markets are undiagnosed,
	the sizeable prevalent population fuels significant sales for the indication. As
	a result, the overactive bladder drug market will increase from approximately $3
	billion in 2009 to nearly $4 billion in 2019 in the United States, France,
	Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan.

	In 2003, Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis) acquired the

	approved for sale in Europe and the United States in 2004. As the global sales
	of Emselex&#174;/Enablex&#174; were below the critical sales threshold for Novartis, the
	company decided to reduce its marketing and sales efforts in the majority of
	territories where the product was marketed. In 2010, Novartis divested the

	sell the branded prescription medicine product Emselex&#174;/Enablex&#174; (darifenacin)
	extended release tablets. Darifenacin is a muscarinic antagonist indicated for
	the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence,
	urgency and frequency. The product&#146;s specific mechanism of action is the
	blocking of the M3 muscarinic receptor, which is primarily responsible for
	bladder muscle contractions. As overactive bladder is a chronic condition,
	Emselex&#174;/Enablex&#174; is prescribed as a medication to be taken once daily and the

	Transition Period under Novartis Acquisition Agreement

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The acquisition of the license rights to Enablex were completed
	pursuant to the Novartis Acquisition Agreement. As part of this agreement, we
	entered into a transition services and supply agreement with Novartis to
	facilitate the seamless and efficient transfer of the product to us. The
	agreement required that Novartis continue to manufacture, distribute, and
	promote the Enablex product in the licensed territories until we had obtained
	the necessary marketing authorizations to allow us to take over these functions
	as principal. During this transition period, Novartis provided us with a monthly
	reconciliation of revenues, cost of goods, and marketing and selling expenses
	for which we then billed Novartis for the net amount receivable. We relied on
	the financial information provided by Novartis to estimate the amounts due under
	this agreement. Based on the terms of this arrangement and the guidance per IAS
	18 regarding agency relationships, for the period of this arrangement the
	Company recorded revenues relating to Enablex on a net basis in the statement of
	operations, net of cost of goods and marketing and selling expenses. During
	April and May 2013, substantially all marketing authorizations for Enablex were
	transferred to us and we began selling directly to third parties and took over
	all other responsibilities for purchase and sale of the product. As a result, we
	determined we were acting as the principal in the sales of Enablex as opposed to
	an agent. As such, revenues for sales of Enablex made by the Company acting as
	principal were accounted for on a gross basis, as opposed for on a net-basis.

	The core patents protecting our Vancocin products expired on July 13, 2010.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Vancomycin was first isolated by Eli Lilly. The original
	indication for vancomycin was for the treatment of penicillin-resistant
	staphylococcus aureus. One advantage that was quickly apparent is that
	staphylococci did not develop significant resistance despite serial passage in
	culture media containing vancomycin. The rapid development of penicillin
	resistance by staphylococci led to the compounds being fast-tracked for approval
	by the US Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;). Eli Lilly first marketed
	vancomycin hydrochloride under the trade name Vancocin. Vancocin is a powerful
	antibiotic used to treat a life-threatening disease resulting from the infection
	of Clostridium Difficile (&#147;C. Difficile&#148;).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	C. Difficile is on the increase with higher mortality and
	severity. Due to the nature of the disease, intravenous (systemic) solutions are
	regarded as ineffective. To be effective against C. Difficile, drugs must act
	locally on the flora of the gastro intestinal track. Intravenous solutions by
	definition do not act locally.

	Clinical Practice Guidelines (Clinical Practice Guidelines for
	Clostridium difficile Infection in Adults: 2010 Update by the Society for

	severe cases of C. Difficile. The guidelines state that vancomycin is the drug
	of choice for an initial episode of severe C. Difficile. The dosage is 125 mg
	orally four times per day for 10&#150;14 days. Vancomycin administered orally (and

	Also, the future of Vancocin may be affected by new therapies
	such as DIFICID&#174; (Fidaxomicin), a macrocyclic antibiotic, which may replace the

	Difficile in a phase III non-inferiority study reported in the February 3, 2011
	issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. However, DIFICID&#174;is currently

	certain foreign countries, is also required. The FTC, the FDA and state and

	federal False Claims Act imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or
	entities who submit (or cause the submission of) false or fraudulent claims for
	payment to the government. If our operations are found to be in violation of any
	of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental
	regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to

	The following discussion should be read in conjunction
	with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the Consolidated Financial Statements
	of Merus and the Notes relating thereto, included as item 17 in this Form 20-F.
	The information contained in this Item 5 refers to Financial Statements of
	Merus, which are presented in Canadian dollars and are prepared in accordance
	with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the
	International Accounting Standards Board.

	U.S. readers are cautioned that IFRS differs in certain

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We acquired Old Merus on December 19, 2011 pursuant to the
	amalgamation of the Company and Old Merus to form a new amalgamated entity under
	the name &#147;Merus Labs International Inc.&#148;. We have accounted for the amalgamation
	as an acquisition of Old Merus using the acquisition method of accounting, with
	the Company as the acquirer, and with the acquisition of the assets and
	liabilities of Old Merus being recorded at fair value. The common shares that we
	issued to complete the acquisition were valued using the market price at the
	time of the amalgamation and the stock options and share purchase warrants
	issued were valued using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Details as to the
	purchase price allocation are provided in Note 3 to our audited financial
	statements presented in Item 17 to this Form 20-F.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Based on this accounting, our results of operations for the
	year ended September 30, 2012 include the operations of Old Merus from December
	20, 2011, the first day following the amalgamation, to September 30, 2012. We
	have presented pro-forma financial information showing our results of operations
	for the year ended September 30, 2012 had the acquisition occurred as at October
	1, 2011 in Note 3 to our audited financial statements presented in Item 17 to
	this Form 20-F. This pro-forma financial information is presented for
	information purposes only and does not purport to represent what our operating
	results would have been had the acquisition occurred as at October 1, 2011 or to
	project our results of operating for any future period.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We incurred a net loss of $3,102,129 for fiscal 2013 compared
	to a net loss of $20,720,548 for fiscal 2012. The reduction to our net loss was
	primarily attributable to increased revenues in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 and
	significant non-recurring impairment charges that were incurred in fiscal
	2012.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For the year ended September 30, 2013, EBITDA
<SUP>
	1
</SUP>
	was
	$18,372,453, compared to $2,694,534 for the prior year. Adjusted
	EBITDA
<SUP>
	1
</SUP>
	, which adds back non-cash share based compensation expense
	and acquisition costs, was $19,365,502, compared to $5,427,774 for the prior
	year comparative period. As at September 30, 2013, the Company had an
	accumulated deficit of $52,972,037.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Cash provided by continuing operations of the Company was
	$11,464,696 for the year ended September 30, 2013, compared to cash provided by
	continuing operations of $640,506, for the year ended September 30, 2012. Cash
	provided by (used in) discontinued operations of the Company for the same
	periods were $1,512,137 and ($796,451), respectively.

	EBITDA &#150; Non-IFRS Financial Measures
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The term EBITDA does not have any standardized meaning under
	IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other
	companies. The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest expense,
	taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange gains or losses and
	unusual items; such as writedowns and gains or losses on intellectual property
	and investments. The Company believes EBITDA to be an important measurement that
	allows it to assess the operating performance of its ongoing business on a
	consistent basis without the impact of amortization expenses, debt service
	obligations and other non-operating items. The Company excludes amortization
	expenses because their level depends substantially on non-operating factors such
	as the historical cost of intangible assets. The Company's method for
	calculating EBITDA may differ from that used by other issuers and, accordingly,
	this measure may not be comparable to EBITDA used by other issuers.

	Revenues and Gross Margin
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Revenues were $28,385,968 for the year ended September 30, 2013
	compared to revenues of $9,257,843 for the year ended September 30, 2012. All
	revenues in fiscal 2013 were attributable to sales of Vancocin and Enablex.
	Sales attributed to Factive during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 are reflected
	under income from discontinued operations.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Gross margin for the year ended September 30, 2013 was
	$25,934,777 (91%) compared to gross margin of $8,390,720 (91%) for the year
	ended September 30, 2012. The Company expects that gross margin as a percentage
	of revenues will decline in 2014 as the Company continues the shift to reporting
	revenues from Enablex on a gross basis, rather than on a net basis, as discussed
	below.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Revenues attributable to Enablex for the year ended September
	30, 2013, recorded partially on a net basis, were $22,234,391, after deducting
	costs of goods sold and marketing costs. Revenues from Enablex for the prior
	year ended September 30, 2012, which reflected revenues from the date of
	acquisition (July 11, 2012) through September 30, 2012 calculated entirely on a
	net basis, were $2,351,911.
<B>
</B>
	Until the beginning of the third quarter of
	2013, the Company recorded revenues in the statements of operations relating to
	Enablex on a net basis whereby revenues net of cost of goods and marketing and
	selling expenses are recorded due to a period of transition under the Novartis
	Acquisition Agreement whereby Novartis continued to provide certain sales and
	distribution functions while the parties worked through the process of
	transferring the necessary marketing authorizations. The Company has now
	transferred the majority of marketing authorizations in the territories in which
	it operates. Until the marketing authorizations transferred, the Company was
	reporting revenues from Enablex on a net basis, equal to the net compensation it
	received from Novartis. Beginning in the third quarter, revenues and costs of
	goods, along with marketing expenses, were reported on a gross basis within the
	financial statements. Had the Company reported Enablex on a gross basis for the
	entire year, revenues for the year ended September 30, 2013 for in-market net
	sales for Enablex would have been $26,494,618 and cost of goods sold and sales
	and marketing expenses would have been higher by $3,471,668 and $788,559,
	respectively. EBITDA would be unchanged.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Revenues attributable to Vancocin were $6,151,577 for the year
	ended September 30, 2013, compared to $6,905,932 for the year ended September
	30, 2012. For the comparative year ended September 30, 2012, net sales on a
	pro-forma basis, which reflect the net sales of Vancocin if the Company had
	acquired Old Merus as of October 1, 2011, were $9,389,108. The decrease in
	revenue from this product in the current fiscal year was primarily due to the
	entry of a generic Vancomycin which received reimbursement status in several
	provinces during the Company's fiscal 2013 first quarter.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Operating Expenses
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2013 were
	$7,562,324, compared to $5,696,186 for the prior period ended September 30,
	2012. Excluding the impact of non-cash share based compensation, operating
	expenses in the current year increased by $3,087,510 compared to the same period
	in 2012. This was due primarily to an increase in sales and marketing and
	general and administrative expenses from active operations as a specialty
	pharmaceutical company as well as increased costs associated with a full year of
	operations of Enablex. The addition of this product in late fiscal 2012 led to
	additional overhead expenses relating to establishing operations in Europe, as
	well as additional sales and marketing costs. This increase is offset by
	acquisition costs of $518,819 related primarily to the amalgamation of Old Merus

	Included in operating expenses, the Company incurred sales and
	marketing expenses of $1,165,353 for the year ended September 30, 2013, compared
	to $281,272 for the year ended September 30, 2012. The increase in sales and
	marketing costs in the current year is due to expenses for Enablex which are now
	being incurred directly rather than netted against revenue, as was the case
	while the Company completed its transition stage during which Novartis was
	manufacturing, distributing, and promoting the product.

	The year ended September 30, 2013 included amortization expense

	patents. During the year ended September 30, 2012, the Company owned Enablex for

	lower amortization of just $3,855,604 for the comparative period.

	An impairment charge of $22,208,721 was recognized for the year
	ended September 30, 2012 in relation to the Company&#146;s Vancocin and wound care
	products and associated goodwill. $5,532,624 of the charge related to the
	Vancocin and wound care product intangible assets. In connection with the
	impairment of the Vancocin product rights, management also tested the Company&#146;s
	goodwill for impairment. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit
	(&#147;CGU&#148;) to which goodwill had been allocated was assessed to be less than its
	carrying amount. Based on this analysis, the carrying amount of goodwill was
	reduced to its recoverable amount through recognition of an impairment charge of
	$16,676,097 against the goodwill. Management determined no evidence of
	additional impairment existed at September 30, 2013.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Interest expense of $5,462,466 was incurred during the year
	ended September 30, 2013, primarily as a result of the credit facility entered
	into with PDL BioPharma, Inc. in connection with the acquisition of Enablex,
	which was not in place for most of the comparative period, resulting in a lower
	amount of $1,466,151 of interest expense for fiscal 2012. As the underlying debt
	was refinanced late in fiscal 2013, management expects these costs to be
	considerably lower going forward.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the year ended September 30, 2013, the Company
	recognized impairment charges of $1,262,000 on its privately held investment.
	The impairment charges were based on new information regarding the financial
	condition of the respective investee company. The private company investment is
	a legacy investment made prior to the Company's amalgamation with Old Merus and
	is not a component of the Company&#146;s core business.

	Foreign exchange losses of $1,608,563 were recorded in the year

	smaller amount of US dollar denominated debt during most of the year ended
	September 30, 2012, and a strengthening of the Canadian dollar late in fiscal
	2012 contributed to a gain on foreign exchange of $1,825,206 for that period.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company had a net loss of $20,720,548 (or $0.90 basic loss
	per share) for the year ended September 30, 2012 compared to a net loss of
	$7,560,954 (or $0.94 basic loss per share) for the year ended September 30,
	2011. As the Corporation completed its amalgamation on December 19, 2011,
	results related to the pharmaceutical operations are included in the financial
	results beginning December 20, 2011. Results prior to that date reflect the
	operations of the Corporation&#146;s former business as Envoy. As such, revenues
	generated from its merchant banking business were reclassified as ancillary
	income in the comparative periods, resulting in a nil gross margin for the year
	ended September 30, 2011. In addition, certain one-time costs were incurred as
	the Corporation restructured its management team. The Corporation incurred
	approximately $6.1 million in restructuring costs relating to severance and
	office closure. The Corporation also disposed of its former operating
	subsidiary, Watt International Inc., at the end of fiscal 2011 and, as such,
	results of this business have been reflected as discontinued operations.

	Revenues and Gross Margin
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Revenues for the year ended September 30, 2012 were $9,257,843
	compared to nil for the year ended September 30, 2011. The nil revenues are a
	result of reclassifying amounts to conform to the current presentation as a
	pharmaceutical company as opposed to its former operations as a merchant bank.
	If the Company had amalgamated with Old Merus on October 1, 2011 and owned
	Vancocin during the full twelve month period, gross margin would have been
	$10,567,694 (or 90%), consisting of net sales of Vancocin and revenue from
	Enablex totalling $11,741,019 less cost of goods sold of $1,173,325. Sales of
	Vancocin from October 1 through December 31, 2011 were strong given the outbreak
	of C. Difficile throughout Canada during 2011 and as hospitals increased their
	supply of Vancocin for the approaching winter flu season. The Company recorded
	revenues relating to Enablex net of cost of goods and marketing and selling
	expenses in a single line, revenues, in the statements of operations during the
	period of transition from Novartis to Merus.

	Operating Expenses

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2012 were
	$5,696,186 compared to $2,587,633 in 2011. This was due primarily to an increase
	in general and administrative expenses from active operations as a specialty
	pharmaceutical company and non-cash charges for share based compensation as a
	result of the granting of equity compensation to the Company&#146;s management team.
	In addition, the Company incurred sales and marketing expenses of $281,272
	related to Vancocin. Sales and marketing costs for Enablex were netted against
	revenue as the Company completed a transition stage whereby Novartis continued
	to manufacture, distribute, and promote the product until the Company obtained
	the necessary marketing authorizations to allow it to take over these functions
	from a regulatory standpoint. .

	We currently manage our capital structure and makes adjustments
	to it, based on cash resources expected to be available to the Company, in order
	to support its future business plans. We had cash and cash equivalents of
	$8,084,367 and working capital of $3,621,264 as at September 30, 2013, compared
	to cash and cash equivalents of $3,462,919 and a working capital deficit of
	$21,508,320 as at September 30, 2012. The increase in cash and cash equivalents
	was primarily due to cash generated from operations during 2013. The substantial
	increase in our working capital was attributable to the refinancing of the PDL
	BioPharma credit facility in September 2013 which was repaid in full using the
	proceeds of the senior secured facility provided by a syndicate of Canadian
	chartered banks and the convertible debenture financing.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our new debt facility matures September 30, 2016 and provides
	for a $30 million term loan, currently at prime plus 3.0%, with monthly payments
	of principal and interest. Principal payments are $700,000 per month for the
	first 24 months, increasing to $1,100,000 per month for the final 12 months. The
	facility also provides for up to $2 million on a revolving line of credit, based
	on eligible accounts receivable.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In connection with the refinancing, we issued convertible
	debentures with a principal value of $10,000,000 to two investment funds. The
	debentures have a term of five years, maturing September 20, 2018, with interest
	at 8.0%, payable quarterly.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our plan of operations in the next twelve months is to satisfy
	short-term debt obligations using cash generated from operations, while
	strategically looking for new acquisitions. We may raise additional financing,
	if required, to pursue the acquisition of other pharmaceutical products.
	Management reviews the capital management approach on an ongoing basis and
	believes that this approach is reasonable given the current state of financial
	markets. In the case of uncertainty over the ability to raise funds in current
	or future economic conditions, the Company would manage capital by minimizing
	ongoing expenses. We currently do not have any arrangements in place for
	additional financing should we determine to acquire any additional
	pharmaceutical products. There is no assurance that such financing will be
	available to us should we determine to acquire any additional pharmaceutical
	products.

	Cash provided by continuing operations of the Company were
	$11,464,696 for the year ended September 30, 2013, compared to $640,506 for the
	year ended September 30, 2012. The increase in cash from operations in fiscal
	2013 was primarily a result of a full year of operations of the Company's
	largest product, Enablex, whereas in fiscal 2013, the product was only in the
	Company portfolio for less than three months. The Company also incurred
	considerably more one-time costs in the prior year period as it completed its

	Cash used in financing activities for the year ended September

	Company's long-term debt, offset by cash raised under a private placement. We
	repaid long-term debt in the amount of $54,219,629 in fiscal 2013 that was
	attributable to the PDL BioPharma credit facility using proceeds from our new
	debt facility and the issuance of convertible debentures. In fiscal 2012, cash
	provided by financing activities was $62,293,179, most of which related to the
	original financing of the Enablex transaction in July 2012, but also included
	two equity financings - a private placement completed concurrent with the
	amalgamation as well as a prospectus offering in May 2012.

	Accounting policies
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following are the changes in the Company&#146;s critical
	accounting policies during the year:
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Revenue recognition and estimated product returns
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Revenue from product sales, including shipments to
	distributors, is recognized when the Company has transferred to the customer the
	significant risks and benefits of ownership or future obligations with respect
	to the product, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the
	transaction will flow to the Company and the amount of revenue can be measured
	reliably. Revenue from product sales is recognized net of estimated sales
	discounts, credits, returns, rebates and allowances.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In connection with its acquisition of Enablex, the Company
	entered into a transition services and supply agreement with the vendor
	(Novartis Pharma AG, or &#147;Novartis&#148;) to facilitate the seamless and efficient
	transfer of the product to the Company. The agreement required that Novartis
	continue to manufacture, distribute, and promote the product until the Company
	obtained the necessary marketing authorizations to allow it to take over these
	functions as principal. Novartis provided the Company with a monthly
	reconciliation of revenues, cost of goods, and marketing and selling expenses
	for which the Company then billed Novartis for the net amount receivable. The
	Company relied on the financial information provided by Novartis to estimate the
	amounts due under this agreement. Based on the terms of this arrangement and the
	guidance per IAS 18 regarding agency relationships, for the period of this
	arrangement the Company recorded revenues relating to Enablex on a net basis in
	the statement of operations, net of cost of goods and marketing and selling
	expenses. During April and May 2013, substantially all marketing authorizations
	for Enablex were transferred and the Company began selling directly to third
	parties, incurred the inventory risk and took over all other responsibilities
	for purchase and sale of the product. As a result, management determined the
	Company was acting as the principal in the sales of Enablex as opposed to an
	agent. As such, revenues for sales of Enablex made by the Company acting as
	principal were accounted for on a gross basis, in the same manner as its other
	products as described above.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s return policy is limited to damaged or expired
	product. The return allowance is determined based on analysis of the historical
	rate of returns and current market conditions, which is applied directly against
	sales.

	The following are the critical judgements, apart from those

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Functional currency
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Management has exercised judgement in selecting the functional
	currency of each of the entities that it consolidates based on the primary
	economic environment in which the entity operates and in reference to the
	various indicators as provided by IAS 21 &#150;
<I>
	The effects of changes in foreign
	exchange rates
</I>
	. The consolidated financial statements of the Company are
	presented in Canadian dollars (&#147;CAD&#148;), which is the parent Company&#146;s functional
	and presentation currency.

<I>
	Use of estimates
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In preparation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial
	statements in accordance with IFRS, management is required to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, and the
	disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
	the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
	Actual results could differ from those estimates used in the Company&#146;s
	consolidated financial statements and such differences could be material.

	Revenue from product sales is recognized net of estimated sales
	discounts, credits, returns, rebates and allowances. The Company&#146;s return policy

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company as part of its business combinations and product
	acquisitions performs a preliminary assessment of the fair value of all assets
	and liabilities acquired based on all current available information. As part of
	the measurement period to finalize the purchase price allocation, management
	updates the estimated fair values as information becomes available, support from
	third party market data becomes available, and where necessary, third party
	independent valuations are obtained. Management is ultimately responsible for
	concluding on the allocation of purchase price and estimates of fair value for
	the acquired assets and liabilities.

</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there
	is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
	impaired. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has occurred on
	an unquoted or not actively traded equity instrument that is not carried at fair
	value (because its fair value cannot be reliably measured), the amount of the
	loss is measured as the difference between the asset&#146;s carrying amount and the
	present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market
	rate of return for a similar financial asset and is recognized in profit or loss
	for the period. Reversals of impairment losses on assets carried at cost are not
	permitted.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For financial assets carried at amortized cost, the amount of
	the loss is measured as the difference between the asset&#146;s carrying amount and
	the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses
	that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset&#146;s original
	effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial
	recognition).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Objective evidence of impairment of financial assets carried at
	amortized cost exists if the counterparty is experiencing significant financial
	difficulty, there is a breach of contract, concessions are granted to the
	counterparty that would not normally be granted, or it is probable the
	counterparty will enter into bankruptcy or a financial reorganization.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation
	of the recoverable amount of the cash generating units (&#147;CGUs&#148;) or groups of
	CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. The determination of recoverable
	amount requires the Company to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise
	from these CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the
	recoverable amount of the CGUs. If the recoverable amount of the CGUs is less
	than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the second and third quarters of 2013, the Company&#146;s
	market capitalization was less than the total net assets of the Company and as
	such, the Company was required to assess its intangible assets for impairment.
	The Company carried out a review of the recoverable amount of the assets of each
	of its cash generating units (&#147;CGUs&#148;), which are defined at the product line
	level (Vancocin, Enablex and Factive). The carrying values of the CGUs at each
	impairment evaluation date, as well as at September, 30, 2013 are included

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Board has a broad responsibility for supervising the
	management of the business and affairs of the Company. The Chairman of the Board
	is responsible for establishing the Agenda for each Board meeting and ensuring
	agenda items are dealt with. The Board has not found it necessary to develop
	specific position descriptions for the Chair of Board committees. The Board is
	currently of the view that the general mandates of committees on which such
	directors may sit are sufficient to delineate the role and responsibilities of
	the Chair of each committee.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s articles state that the Chief Executive Officer
	of the Company shall exercise general supervision over the affairs of the
	Company. The Board has not found it necessary to develop a specific position
	description for the Chief Executive Officer beyond this description.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	Orientation and Continuing Education:

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	New directors are given the opportunity to individually meet
	with members of senior management to improve their understanding of the
	Company&#146;s business. All directors have regular access to senior management to
	discuss Board presentations and other matters of interest.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company also gives directors a reference manual, which
	contains information about the Company&#146;s history and current status, corporate
	governance materials, its investments and its shareholders. This reference
	manual is updated regularly. It includes the Company&#146;s Code of Business Conduct,
	which also applies to the directors, as well as governance and responsibilities
	of the Board and its committees, and a description of the duties and obligations
	of directors. As part of its mandate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance
	Committee is also responsible for providing orientation and continuing education
	for all board members, including reimbursing costs of attending certain outside
	director education programs. During their regular scheduled Board meetings,
	directors are given presentations on various aspects of the Company&#146;s
	business.

	Nomination of Directors:
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The members of the Company&#146;s Nominating and Corporate
	Governance Committee are all independent directors. The Nominating and Corporate
	Governance Committee has the responsibility for assessing potential Board
	nominees, screening their qualifications and making recommendations for approval
	by the Board of nominees for election or appointment to the Board. To help
	achieve this task, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee develops
	qualifications and criteria for the selection of directors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Board aims to have a sufficient range of skills, expertise
	and experience to ensure that it can carry out its responsibilities effectively.
	Directors are chosen for their ability to contribute to the broad range of
	issues that the Board must deal with. The Board reviews each director&#146;s
	contribution through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and
	determines whether the Board&#146;s size allows it to function efficiently and
	effectively. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is mandated to
	review the size of the Board from time to time and recommend changes in size
	when appropriate.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Each year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
	reviews how directors are compensated for serving on the Board and its
	committees. It compares their compensation to that of similar companies and
	recommends any changes to the Board. In 2012, the Board adopted a new
	compensation structure to better align the goals of the Company and its senior
	management. Directors are paid an annual fee of $20,000, an additional $5,000
	for serving on a sub-committee and meeting fees of $1,000 or $750. Directors may
	also participate in the Company&#146;s Stock Option Plan.

	As part of its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance

	securities legislation and other statutory and contractual obligations limiting
	the disclosure of such information. Information material to the Company&#146;s

	The Articles of Merus do not require disclosure of share

	proxy materials sent to Merus's shareholders. There are no requirements under
	British Columbia corporate law to report ownership of shares of Merus but
	Canadian Securities Law requires disclosure of trading by insiders (generally
	officers, directors and holders of 10% of voting shares) within 5 days of the
	trade. In addition, Canadian Securities Laws require disclosure of acquisition
	of more than 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company by press
	release and filing of an early warning report within 2 business days of the
	acquisition. Canadian Securities Laws also require that we disclose in our
	annual general meeting proxy statement, holders who beneficially own more than
	10% of our issued and outstanding shares, and United States federal securities

	Except as provided in the Investment Canada Act, there are no
	limitations specific to the rights of non-Canadians to hold or vote our common

	The following summarizes the principal features of the Investment Canada Act for
	non-Canadian residents proposing to acquire our common shares.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to
	be, and should not be construed to be, legal advice to any holder or prospective
	holder of our common shares, and no opinion or representation to any holder or
	prospective holder of our common shares is hereby made. Accordingly, holders and
	prospective holders of our common shares should consult with their own legal
	advisors with respect to the consequences of purchasing and owning our common
	shares.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Investment Canada Act governs the direct or indirect
	acquisition of control of an existing Canadian business by non-Canadians. Under
	the Investment Canada Act, non-Canadian persons or entities acquiring &#147;control&#148;
	(as defined in the Investment Canada Act) of a corporation carrying on business
	in Canada are required to either notify, or file an application for review with,
	Industry Canada, unless a specific exemption, as set out in the Investment
	Canada Act, applies. Industry Canada may review any transaction which results in
	the direct or indirect acquisition of control of a Canadian business, where the
	gross value of corporate assets exceeds certain threshold levels (which are
	higher for investors from members of the World Trade Organization, including
	United States residents, or World Trade Organization member-controlled
	companies) or where the activity of the business is related to Canada&#146;s cultural
	heritage or national identity. No change of voting control will be deemed to
	have occurred, for purposes of the Investment Canada Act, if less than one-third
	of the voting control of a Canadian corporation is acquired by an investor. In
	addition, the Investment Canada Act permits the Canadian government to review
	any investment where the responsible Minister has reasonable grounds to believe
	that an investment by a non-Canadian could be injurious to national security. No
	financial threshold applies to a national security review. The Minister may deny
	the investment, ask for undertakings, provide terms or conditions for the
	investment or, where the investment has already been made, require divestment.
	Review can occur before or after closing and may apply to corporate
	re-organizations where there is no change in ultimate control.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If an investment is reviewable under the Investment Canada Act,
	an application for review in the form prescribed is normally required to be
	filed with Industry Canada prior to the investment taking place, and the
	investment may not be implemented until the review has been completed and the
	Minister responsible for the Investment Canada Act is satisfied that the
	investment is likely to be of net benefit to Canada. If the Minister is not
	satisfied that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to Canada, the
	non-Canadian applicant must not implement the investment, or if the investment
	has been implemented, may be required to divest itself of control of the
	Canadian business that is the subject of the investment. The Minister is
	required to provide reasons for a decision that an investment is not of net
	benefit to Canada.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Certain transactions relating to our common shares will
	generally be exempt from the Investment Canada Act, subject to the Minister&#146;s
	prerogative to conduct a national security review, including:

	Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following discussion is intended to be a general summary of
	certain material Canadian federal income tax considerations applicable to
	holders of common shares described below and is not intended to be, nor should
	it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular person, and no
	opinion or representation with respect to income tax considerations is hereby
	given or made. It does not take into account the particular circumstances of any
	investor and does not address considerations applicable to an investor to whom
	special provisions of Canadian income tax law apply. Each person should consult
	their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of an investment in
	the common shares in their own particular circumstances.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following summary is based upon the current provisions of
	the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the &#147;ITA&#148;), and the regulations thereunder and the
	Canada-United States Income Tax Convention (1980) as amended (the &#147;Convention&#148;),
	all proposed amendments to the ITA and the regulations thereunder publicly
	announced by the Department of Finance, Canada prior to the date hereof, and the
	current published administrative policies and assessing practices of the Canada
	Revenue Agency. Except for the foregoing, this summary does not take into
	account or anticipate any changes in the law or the Convention or the
	administrative policies or assessing practices of the Canada Revenue Agency
	whether by legislative, governmental or judicial action or decision, and does
	not take into account or anticipate provincial, territorial or foreign tax
	legislation or considerations, which may differ significantly from the Canadian
	federal income tax considerations described herein.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The summary discusses the principal Canadian federal income tax
	considerations under the ITA and the regulations thereunder generally applicable
	to purchasers of common shares who, at all relevant times (i) for purposes of
	the ITA, are not resident in or deemed to be resident in Canada, deal at arm&#146;s
	length with Merus, are not affiliated with Merus, hold their common shares as
	capital property, do not use or hold, and will not be deemed to use or hold
	their common shares in, or in the course of carrying on, a business in Canada,
	and are not &#147;financial institutions&#148; for the purposes of the mark-to-market
	rules, and (ii) for purposes of the Convention, are residents of the U.S. and
	not residents of Canada, are &#147;qualifying persons&#148; entitled to the benefits of
	the Convention, and do not hold their common shares as part of the business
	property of, or so that their common shares are effectively connected with, a
	permanent establishment in Canada, or in connection with a fixed base in Canada.
	A purchaser that meets all of the foregoing requirements is referred to in this
	summary as a &#147;U.S. Holder&#148;, and this summary only addresses such U.S. Holders.
	Special rules, which are not discussed in this summary, may apply to a U.S.
	Holder that is an insurer carrying on a business in Canada and elsewhere. Other
	U.S. Holders of special status or in special circumstances are also not
	addressed in this summary.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Amounts in respect of common shares paid or credited or deemed
	to be paid or credited as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in
	satisfaction of, dividends to a U.S. Holder will generally be subject to
	Canadian non-resident withholding tax. Such withholding tax is levied at a rate
	of 25% under the ITA, which may be reduced pursuant to the terms of the
	Convention. Under the Convention, the rate of Canadian non-resident withholding
	tax on the gross amount of dividends beneficially owned by a U.S. Holder is
	generally reduced to 15% (and to 5% in certain limited circumstances).

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In general, a U.S. Holder will not be subject to tax under the
	ITA in respect of a capital gain realized on a disposition of common shares
	unless, at the time of such disposition, such common shares constitute &#147;taxable
	Canadian property&#148; of the holder for purposes of the ITA. If the common shares
	are listed on a designated stock exchange for the purposes of the ITA, including
	the TSX, at the time they are disposed of, a common share will generally not
	constitute &#147;taxable Canadian property&#148; of the U.S. Holder at such time unless,
	at any time during the 60-month period immediately preceding the disposition of
	the common share, (i) 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of
	Merus was owned by the U.S. Holder, by persons with whom the U.S. Holder did not
	deal at arm&#146;s length, or by the U.S. Holder and persons with whom the U.S.
	Holder did not deal at arm&#146;s length AND (ii) more than 50% of the fair market
	value of the share was derived directly or indirectly from one or any
	combination of real or immovable property situated in Canada, Canadian resource
	properties or timber resource properties (as defined under the ITA) or options
	in respect of or interests in (or for civil law rights in) any of the foregoing.
	The common shares may also be deemed to be taxable Canadian property in certain
	other circumstances under the ITA. Under the Convention, gains derived by a U.S.
	Holder from the disposition of common shares will generally not be taxable in
	Canada unless the value of the common shares is derived principally from real
	property situated in Canada. Affected U.S. Holders should consult with their own
	tax advisors in this regard.

	Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following is a general discussion of certain material
	anticipated United States federal income tax considerations relevant to U.S.
	Holders, defined below, of Merus&#146; common shares who hold such shares as capital
	assets (as defined in Section 1221 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of
	1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;)). This discussion is based on the Code, U.S.
	Treasury regulations thereunder (the &#147;Treasury Regulations&#148;), administrative
	rulings, and court decisions, all as in effect as of the date hereof and all of
	which are subject to differing interpretations and may change at any time
	(possibly with retroactive effect). This discussion is intended to be a general
	description of the United States federal income tax considerations material to a
	purchase, ownership and a disposition of common shares. Readers are cautioned
	that this discussion does not address all relevant tax consequences relating to
	an investment in the common shares, nor does it take into account tax
	consequences peculiar to persons subject to special provisions of United States
	federal income tax law, such as financial institutions, tax-deferred accounts,
	tax-exempt organizations, qualified retirements plans, real estate investment
	trusts, regulated investment companies or brokers, dealers or traders in
	securities, persons actually or constructively owning 10% or more of the voting
	power of Merus&#146; stock, persons that hold common shares through a partnership or
	other pass through entity, or persons that hold common shares that are a hedge
	against, or that are hedged against, currency risk or that are part of a
	straddle or conversion transaction, or persons whose functional currency is not
	the United States dollar. Therefore, investors should consult a tax advisor
	regarding the particular consequences of purchasing common shares.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	U.S. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT
	TO THE APPLICATION OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR
	PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE UNITED
	STATES FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX RULES OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR
	FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Except as otherwise described, this discussion applies to
	investors that are (i) citizens or individual residents of the United States;
	(ii) corporations (or other entities taxable as corporations), that are created
	or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the United
	States or the District of Columbia; (iii) estates, the income of which is
	subject to federal income taxation, regardless of its source; or (iv) trusts
	(a), if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision
	over the administration of such trust and one or more United States persons as
	described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code has the authority to control all
	substantial decisions of such trust, or (b) that was in existence on August 20,
	1996, was treated as a U.S. person under the code on the previous day and has a
	valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as
	a United States person (a &#147;U.S. Holder&#148;).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The United States federal income tax treatment of a holder of
	common shares that is a partnership (or other entity taxable as a partnership
	for United States federal tax purposes) generally will depend on the status of
	the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in partnerships
	holding common shares should consult their tax advisors about the United States
	federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of
	common shares.

	Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Special United States federal income tax rules apply to U.S.
	Holders owning shares of a passive foreign investment company (a &#147;PFIC&#148;). A
	non-United States corporation generally will be classified as a PFIC for United
	States federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which, after applying
	relevant look-through rules with respect to the income and assets of
	subsidiaries, either at least 75% of its gross income is &#147;passive income,&#148; (the
	&#147;income test&#148;), or on average at least 50% of the gross value of its assets, as
	determined on a quarterly average, is attributable to assets that produce
	passive income or are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;asset
	test&#148;). For this purpose, passive income generally includes, among other things,
	dividends, interest, certain rents and royalties, and gains from the disposition
	of passive assets. Merus believes that it was a PFIC for the taxable year ended
	September 30, 2011, and has been a PFIC in prior tax years. Depending on its
	income, assets and activities, Merus believes that it may be a PFIC in the
	current taxable year and in subsequent taxable years.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If Merus is classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during
	which a U.S. Holder holds common shares, Merus will continue to be treated as a
	PFIC with respect to such U.S. holder in all succeeding years, regardless of
	whether Merus continues to meet the income test or asset test described above in
	such succeeding years. However, under the Treasury Regulations, such U.S. Holder
	will not be treated as holding stock in a PFIC, if in a subsequent taxable year
	in which Merus is not a PFIC, such holder elects to recognize any unrealized
	gain in such common shares as of the last day of the last taxable year during
	which Merus qualified as a PFIC (a &#147;deemed sale&#148; election). Any gain so
	recognized will be subject to the adverse ordinary income and any special
	interest charge consequences described below. Any loss realized on the deemed
	sale is not recognized.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If a U.S. Holder holds common shares of Merus in any year in
	which it is classified as a PFIC, unless a U.S. Holder has a valid &#147;qualified
	electing fund&#148; (&#147;QEF&#148;) election or a mark-to-market election, described below,
	in effect with respect to the common shares, the following income tax
	consequences will result to the U.S. Holder:
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	1. Distributions with respect to Merus&#146; common shares made by
	Merus during the taxable year to a U.S. Holder that are &#147;excess distributions&#148;
	(generally distributions that exceed 125% of the average amount of distributions
	in respect of such common shares received during the preceding three years or,
	if shorter, during the U.S. Holder's holding period prior to the distribution
	year) must be allocated ratably to each day of the U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period.
	The amounts allocated to the current taxable year and to taxable years prior to
	the first year in which Merus was classified as a PFIC are included as ordinary
	income in a U.S. Holder&#146;s gross income for that year. The amount allocated to
	each other prior taxable year is taxed as ordinary income at the highest tax
	rate in effect for the U.S. Holder in that prior year and the tax is subject to
	an interest charge at the rate applicable to deficiencies in income taxes (the
	&#147;special interest charge&#148;), and
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	2. The entire amount of any gain realized upon the sale or
	other disposition of Merus&#146; common shares will be treated as an excess
	distribution made in the year of sale or other disposition and as a consequence
	will be treated as ordinary income and, to the extent allocated to years prior
	to the year of sale or disposition, will be subject to the interest charge
	described above. No portion of any excess distribution will be eligible for the
	favorable 15% United States federal income tax rate applicable to so-called
	&#147;qualified dividend income.&#148;

	QEF Election

</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A U.S. Holder that owns common shares may elect to have Merus
	treated as a QEF, provided that Merus provides such person with certain
	information. A QEF election must be made by a U.S. Holder before the due date
	(with regard to extensions) for such person&#146;s U.S. federal income tax return for
	the taxable year for which the election is made and once made, is effective for
	all subsequent taxable years of
<I>
</I>
	such U.S. Holder unless revoked with the
	consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that has a QEF election in effect with respect
	to all years that such holder holds Merus&#146; stock and that Merus is a PFIC is
	referred to herein as an &#147;Electing U.S. Holder.&#148; Merus has made available to
	U.S. Holders, and expects to continue to make available to U.S. Holders, in
	accordance with applicable procedures, the annual information statement
	currently required by the IRS, which will include information as to the
	allocation of Merus&#146; ordinary earnings and net capital gain among the common
	shares and as to distributions on such common shares. Such statement may be used
	by Electing U.S. Holders for purposes of complying with the reporting

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	An Electing U.S. Holder&#146;s gain or loss on the sale or other
	disposition of such common shares generally will be a capital gain or loss. Such
	capital gain or loss generally will be long-term if such Electing U.S. Holder
	held the common shares for more than one year at the time of the disposition.
	For non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gain is generally subject to a
	maximum federal income tax rate (currently imposed at a rate of 15%) for taxable
	years beginning on or before December 31, 2010 (and, possibly, a higher rate
	thereafter).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A U.S. Holder holding common shares with respect to which a QEF
	election is not in effect for any taxable year in which Merus is a PFIC may
	avoid the adverse ordinary income and special interest charge consequences
	(described above) upon any subsequent disposition of such common shares if such
	person elects to recognize any unrealized gain in such common shares as of the
	first day in the first year that the QEF election applies to such common shares
	(a &#147;deemed sale&#148; election). Any gain so recognized, however, will be subject to
	the adverse ordinary income and special interest charge consequences described
	above.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In any year that Merus is treated as a PFIC, an Electing U.S.
	Holder will be required to include currently in gross income such U.S. Holder&#146;s
	pro rata share of Merus&#146; annual ordinary earnings and annual net capital gains.
	Such inclusion will be required whether or not such U.S. Holder owns common
	shares for an entire year or at the end of Merus&#146; taxable year. The amount so
	includable will be determined without regard to the amount of cash
	distributions, if any, received from Merus. Electing U.S. Holders will be
	required to pay United States federal income tax currently on such imputed
	income, unless, as described below, an election is made to defer such payment.
	The amount currently included in income will be treated as ordinary income to
	the extent of the Electing U.S. Holder&#146;s allocable share of Merus&#146; ordinary
	earnings and generally will be treated as long-term capital gain to the extent
	of such U.S. Holder&#146;s allocable share of Merus&#146; net capital gains. Such net
	capital gains ordinarily would be subject to a maximum 15% United States federal
	income tax rate for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2010 (and,
	possibly, a higher rate thereafter) in the case of non-corporate U.S. Holders,
	unless Merus elects to treat the entire amount of its net capital gain as
	ordinary income. No portion of such ordinary earnings will be eligible for the
	favorable 15% United States federal income tax rate applicable to so-called
	&#147;qualified dividend income.&#148;
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If an Electing U.S. Holder demonstrates to the satisfaction of
	the IRS that amounts actually distributed to him have been previously included
	in income as described above by such U.S. Holder or a previous U.S. Holder, such
	distributions generally will not be taxable. An Electing U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted
	tax basis in his common shares will be increased by any amounts currently
	included in income under the QEF rules and will be decreased by any subsequent
	distributions from Merus that are treated as non-taxable distributions of
	previously-included income (as described in the preceding sentence). For
	purposes of determining the amounts includable in income by Electing U.S.
	Holders, the tax bases of Merus&#146; assets, and Merus&#146; ordinary earnings and net
	capital gains, will be computed on the basis of United States federal income tax
	principles. Accordingly, it is anticipated that such tax bases and such ordinary
	earnings and net capital gains may differ from the figures set forth in Merus&#146;
	financial statements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	An Electing U.S. Holder who sells his common shares prior to
	the end of Merus&#146; taxable year will be required to include in income, as of the
	last day of Merus&#146; taxable year, a portion of Merus&#146; ordinary earnings and net
	capital gains attributable on a pro rata basis to the period during which such
	common shares were held during such taxable year. However, the amount of such
	U.S. Holder&#146;s taxable gain on the sale should be reduced, or the amount of his
	taxable loss increased, by the amount of such income inclusion. If an Electing
	U.S. Holder sells his common shares in a taxable year of such U.S. Holder ending
	during Merus&#146; then current taxable year, such U.S. Holder may nevertheless have
	to include his proportionate share of Merus&#146; ordinary earnings and net capital
	gains in gross income for his taxable year which includes the last day of Merus&#146;
	above referred taxable year. While the matter is unclear, such U.S. Holder
	should be able to claim a loss in his subsequent taxable year equal to the
	amount by which such holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the common shares would have
	increased to reflect the imputed income under the QEF rules.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	An Electing U.S. Holder may elect to defer, until the
	occurrence of certain events, payment of the United States federal income tax
	attributable to amounts includable in income for which no current distributions
	are received, but will be required to pay interest on the deferred tax computed
	by using the statutory rate of interest applicable to an extension of time for
	payment of tax.

	Under temporary Treasury Regulations, an individual is required
	to include in income a proportionate share of the investment expenses of certain
	&#147;pass-through&#148; entities. It is not clear under such Treasury Regulations whether
	a PFIC for which a QEF election is in effect may be treated as a &#147;pass-through&#148;
	entity. If these provisions were to apply to Merus, each individual Electing
	U.S. Holder would be required to include in income an amount equal to a portion
	of Merus&#146; investment expenses and would be permitted an offsetting deduction (if
	otherwise allowable under the Code) to the extent that the amount of such
	expenses included in income, plus certain other miscellaneous itemized
	deductions of such U.S. Holder, exceed 2% of such U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted gross
	income.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Generally, a QEF election that is made with respect to Merus
	will remain in effect throughout an Electing U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period for
	Merus&#146; shares, even if Merus does not qualify as a PFIC in every taxable year
	following the taxable year in which the election is made. In any year in which
	Merus is not treated as a PFIC, an Electing U.S. Holder will have the tax
	consequences described below, under the heading, &#147;Ownership and Disposition of
	Common Shares if Merus is Not a PFIC.&#148;
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	Mark-to-Market Election
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A U.S. Holder generally may make a mark-to-market election with
	respect to shares of &#147;marketable stock&#148; of a PFIC. Under the Code and the
	Treasury Regulations, the term &#147;marketable stock&#148; includes stock of a PFIC that
	is &#147;regularly traded&#148; on a &#147;qualified exchange or other market.&#148; Because Merus&#146;
	common shares are traded on a qualified exchange or other market, a
	market-to-market election will be available with respect to the common
	shares.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As a result of a mark-to-market election, a U.S. Holder will
	generally be required to report gain annually in an amount equal to the excess
	of the fair market value of such common shares at the end of the taxable year
	over the adjusted tax basis of such common shares at that time and will
	generally be required to report loss annually in an amount equal to the excess
	of the adjusted tax basis of such common shares at the end of the taxable year
	over the fair market value of the common shares at that time, but only to the
	extent of any net market-to market gains for prior years. Any gain under this
	computation and any gain on an actual sale or other disposition of the common
	shares will be treated as ordinary income. Any loss under this computation will
	be treated as ordinary loss. Any loss on an actual sale or other disposition
	will be treated as an ordinary loss to the extent of the prior net
	mark-to-market gain and thereafter will be considered capital loss. Thus, a U.S.
	Holder that makes a mark-to-market election will be taxed on appreciation with
	respect to the U.S. Holder&#146;s common shares even though such U.S. Holder has no
	corresponding receipt of cash. In addition, unlike the case of a QEF election, a
	U.S. Holder that has made a mark-to-market election generally cannot obtain any
	favorably-taxed long-term capital gains with respect to the common shares. The
	U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the common shares is adjusted for any gain
	or loss taken into account under the mark-to-market election. Under the Treasury
	Regulations, if a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election and subsequently makes a
	mark-to-market election with respect to the same stock, the mark-to-market
	election will automatically terminate the QEF election, and such U.S. Holder may
	not make another QEF election with respect to the stock before the sixth taxable
	year thereafter. Unless either (i) the mark-to-market election is made as of the
	first taxable year in which Merus is a PFIC during the U.S. Holder&#146;s holding
	period for the common shares, or (ii) a QEF election has been in effect with
	respect to such U.S. holder&#146;s common stock for all years in which Merus was a
	PFIC during such U.S. holder&#146;s holding period, any mark-to-market gain for the
	election year generally will be subject to the excess distribution rules
	applicable to dispositions described above.

	U.S. Holders who do not hold common shares during any taxable
	year in which Merus is classified as a PFIC will not be subject to the rules
	described above, under the heading &#147;Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.&#148;
	Instead, such U.S. Holders will be required to include the gross amount of any
	distribution on common shares (without reduction for Canadian tax withheld) in
	their gross income as a taxable dividend, to the extent such distribution is
	paid out of Merus&#146; current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined
	under United States federal income tax principles. U.S. Holders must include in
	income an amount equal to the United States dollar value of such dividends on
	the date of receipt, based on the exchange rate on such date. Provided that
	Merus is not treated as a PFIC, described above, during any year in which a U.S.
	Holder holds Merus&#146; common shares in the case of a non-corporate U.S. Holder,
	including individuals, such dividends generally will be eligible for a maximum
	rate of tax of 15% under current law for dividends received in a taxable year
	beginning before January 1, 2011, provided certain conditions are satisfied. To
	the extent that distributions paid by Merus exceed Merus&#146; current or accumulated
	earnings and profits, they will be treated first as a return of capital up to
	the U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the shares, and then as a gain from the
	sale or exchange of the shares.

	U.S. Holders will generally be entitled to a foreign tax
	credit, or deduction, for United States federal income tax purposes, in an
	amount equal to the Canadian tax withheld from a distribution on common shares.
	For taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2006, dividends paid by
	Merus generally will constitute foreign source &#147;passive income&#148; or &#147;financial
	services income&#148; for foreign tax credit purposes. For taxable years beginning
	after December 31, 2006, such dividends generally will be treated as &#147;passive
	category income&#148; or &#147;general category income&#148;, for United States foreign tax
	credit purposes. The Code applies various limitations on the amount of foreign
	tax credit that may be claimed by a United States taxpayer. Because of the
	complexity of those limitations, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
	advisors with respect to the amount of foreign taxes they may claim as a credit.
	Dividends paid by Merus on the common shares will not generally be eligible for
	the &#147;dividends received&#148; deductions.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A U.S. Holder that sells common shares will generally recognize
	a gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
	realized on the sale and the U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the shares.
	Unless Merus is treated as a PFIC during any year in which the U.S. Holder holds
	Merus&#146; common shares (described above), any gain or loss recognized upon the
	sale of shares held as capital assets will be a long-term or short-term capital
	gain or loss, depending on whether the common shares have been held for more
	than one year. Such gain or loss generally will be treated as United States
	source income or loss for United States foreign tax credit purposes.

	Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	United States backup withholding tax and information reporting
	requirements generally apply to certain payments to certain non-corporate
	holders of the common shares. Information reporting generally will apply to
	payments of dividends on, and to proceeds from the sale or disposition of,
	common shares by a payor within the United States to a U.S. Holder (if such
	person is other than an exempt recipient, including a corporation, not a United
	States person that provides an appropriate certification or certain other
	persons).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A payor within the United States will be required to withhold
	tax (currently imposed at a rate of 28%) on any payments made to a common
	shareholder (if that common shareholder is not an exempt recipient) consisting
	of dividends on, or proceeds from the sale or disposition of, the common shares,
	if the selling common shareholder fails to timely furnish a correct taxpayer
	identification number on IRS Form W-9 or otherwise fails to comply with, or
	establish an exemption from, such backup withholding tax requirements. Moreover,
	a payor or middleman may rely on a certification provided by a payee that is not
	a United States person only if such payor or middleman does not have actual
	knowledge or a reason to know that any information or certification stated in
	such certificate is incorrect. Investors will be allowed a refund or a credit
	equal to any amounts withheld under the United States backup withholding tax
	rules against their United States federal income tax liability, provided that
	they furnish the required information to the IRS.

<U>
	Item 11: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
	Market Risk
</U>
</B>
<B>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Except as described below, the Company does not have a material
	position or exposure with respect to any market risk sensitive instruments (as
	defined in Item 11 in Form 20-F).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Until December 19, 2011, a major component of the Company&#146;s
	strategy revolved around investment operations. The Company&#146;s business involved
	the purchase and sale of securities and, accordingly, the majority of the
	Company&#146;s assets were comprised of financial instruments. The use of financial
	instruments can expose the Company to several risks, including market, credit
	and liquidity risks. Apart from the risks listed below, management is of the
	opinion that they are not exposed to any other significant risks. A discussion
	of the Company&#146;s use of financial instruments and its risk management is
	provided below.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	(i) Liquidity risk
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will have
	sufficient cash resources to meet its financial obligations as they come due.
	The Company&#146;s liquidity and operating results may be adversely affected if the
	Company&#146;s access to the capital markets is hindered, whether as a result of a
	downturn in stock market conditions generally or related to matters specific to
	the Company, or if the value of the Company&#146;s investments declines, resulting in
	losses upon disposition. In order to mitigate this risk, the Company maintains a
	sufficient cash balance in order to satisfy short-term liabilities as they come
	due and actively pursues raising capital through various public and private
	financing mechanisms to satisfy longer term needs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	(ii) Market risk:
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Market risk is the risk that the fair value of, or future cash
	flows from, the Company&#146;s financial instruments will significantly fluctuate
	because of changes in market prices. The value of the financial instruments can
	be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and
	commodity prices. The Company is exposed to market risk in trading its
	investments and unfavourable market conditions could result in dispositions of
	investments at less than favourable prices.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	(iii) Currency risk:
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company is subject to currency risk through its sales of
	products denominated in foreign currencies, purchases of inventory in US dollars
	and product acquisitions denominated in foreign currencies.. As such, changes in
	the exchange rate affect the operating results of the Company. Dependent on the
	nature, amount and timing of foreign currency receipts and payments, the Company may from time to
	time enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to
	foreign currency risk.

<A NAME="FORM20F_HTM_PAGE_70">
</A>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	(iv) Credit risk:
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Certain of the Company&#146;s financial assets, including cash,
	short-term investments and loans receivable are exposed to the risk of financial
	loss occurring as a result of default of a counterparty on its obligations to
	the Company. The Company may, from time to time, invest in debt obligations. The
	Company is also exposed, in the normal course of business, to credit risk from
	customer receivables. These amounts are continually monitored by management for
	collectability, and, in general, are lower risk as they are typically due from
	large institutions or multinational distributors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	(v) Interest rate risk:
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Interest risk is the impact that changes in interest rates
	could have on the Company&#146;s earnings and liabilities. The Company is exposed to
	variable interest rates as a result of its senior secured debt, which currently
	bears interest at bank prime plus 3.0% . The Company is able to manage this
	exposure through facilities under its credit agreement which allow the Company
	to convert the interest charge to a fixed rate, either through converting to
	Bankers' Acceptance notes on a short-term basis or through interest rate swaps
	over the remaining term of the loan. As a result of this flexibility, it is
	management&#146;s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest
	rate risk. At September 30, 2013, the Company held no interest-bearing
	investments.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s management, with the participation of its CEO and
	CFO is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
	over financial reporting. The Company&#146;s internal control over financial
	reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
	reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
	for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the quarter ended March 31, 2013, management determined
	that there was a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting
	as at September 30, 2012 which had persisted through the quarter ended December
	31, 2012. In addition, management has concluded that as of September 30, 2012
	and December 31, 2012, Merus&#146; disclosure controls and procedures were not
	effective as a result of the material weakness in internal controls over
	financial reporting. During the fiscal 2012 audit, there were a number of manual
	post-close adjustments as well as several significant adjustments relating to
	complex accounting areas. Concerns centred around two areas of the financial
	reporting process: We did not maintain financial close process and procedures
	that were adequately designed, documented and executed to support the accurate
	and timely reporting of our financial results. As a result, we made a number of
	manual post-close adjustments necessary in order to prepare the financial
	statements included in the annual report. In certain instances, calculations
	were not performed to the required level of accuracy or provisions within
	contractual arrangements were not appropriately recorded. In addition, we did
	not have adequate policies and procedures in place to ensure the timely,
	effective review of estimates, assumptions and analyses related to complex
	accounting areas. As a result, certain adjustments were made to non-cash
	expenses such as goodwill and share-based payments and reclassifications
	occurred as a result of not appropriately interpreting technical guidance
	related to revenue recognition.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	With the oversight of senior management and our audit
	committee, we took steps to remediate the underlying causes of the material
	weakness. In order to address the weakness in the financial close process,
	management implemented additional levels of review along with increased
	involvement of senior management at an earlier stage of the financial reporting
	cycle. The Company also added additional period-end procedures relating to the
	review of account reconciliations and preparation of schedules and analysis to
	accurately reflect contractual terms and arrangements. To address the weakness
	in dealing with complex accounting areas, the Company hired additional finance
	personnel with specific skills in area of valuations and IFRS reporting and will
	consult, as appropriate, with outside accounting expertise on complex technical
	matters. Management began to implement these improvements in internal controls
	shortly after the issuance of its annual report for the year ended September 30,
	2012 and believes it has remediated the root causes of the audit adjustments.
	The remedial measures had been implemented by the end of our second quarter as
	at March 31, 2013.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The identification of the material weakness at September 30,
	2012 was due to a reassessment of conditions that existed at September 30, 2012.
	The deficiencies did not result in any misstatement of the results for either
	the year ended September 30, 2012 or the quarter ended December 31, 2012.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As at September 30, 2013, management evaluated the design and
	operating effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal controls over financial
	reporting and concluded as at September 30, 2013, the Company&#146;s internal
	controls over financial reporting were operating effectively. In making this
	evaluation, the Company&#146;s management used the criteria established in Internal
	Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
	of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Because of its inherent limitations, the Company&#146;s internal
	control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all possible
	misstatements or frauds. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
	future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
	because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies
	or procedures may deteriorate.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s Board of Directors has determined that David
	Guebert, an independent director of the Company, is an &#147;audit committee
	financial expert&#148; (as that term is defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K under
	the Exchange Act). The Company has determined that Mr. Guebert is an
	&#147;independent director&#148; under Rules 5605(a)(2) and 5605(c)(2) of the Nasdaq
	Listing Rules.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Audit Committee has determined that all three members of
	the Audit Committee are Financially Literate. &#147;Financially Literate&#148; means that
	a member has the ability to read and understand a set of financial statements
	that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues that are
	generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of the issues that can
	reasonably be expected to be raised by the Company&#146;s financial statements. David
	Guebert was determined to be Financially Literate based on his qualifications as
	a Canadian Chartered Accountant and experience as the Chief Financial Officer of
	a number of public companies where he was responsible for supervising the
	preparation of financial statements of a similar breadth and complexity to the
	Company&#146;s financial statements, where he was responsible for making judgments
	and decisions related to accounting matters on behalf of management and where he
	was accountable for internal controls and financial reporting procedures. Tim
	Sorensen was determined to be Financially Literate based on his significant
	experience as director of capital markets and institutional sales. Michael
	Cloutier was determined to be Financially Literate based on his experience as
	CEO and President of multiple companies. The particulars of each member&#146;s
	experience can be found in the biographies under Item 6A.

	The Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct (the &#147;Code&#148;).
	All of the Company&#146;s employees, directors and officers must follow the Code,
	which provides guidelines for ethical behaviour. A copy of the Code is

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Code sets out in detail the principles and general business
	tenets and ethics and compliance policies applicable to the Company&#146;s business

	and conflicts of interest; compliance with applicable laws and Company policies
	and procedures; business integrity and fair dealing; public disclosure; use of
	corporate property and opportunities; confidentiality; compliance with insider
	trading and other legal requirements; and records and document retention.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Board expects all employees at all levels of the companies
	within its group, as well as officers, directors, customers, suppliers, vendors,
	contractors and partners, to read, understand and comply with the Code. If any
	employee is uncertain about a situation, the employee is expected to refer the
	matter to a supervisor or Human Resources representative. All employees are also
	expected to report in good faith any violations or potential violations of the
	Code and to co-operate in internal investigations about a reported violation.
	Supervisors are expected to answer employee questions about the Code or direct
	them to the right source of information; provide timely advice and guidance to
	employees on ethics and compliance concerns; handle all employee reports
	promptly and confidentially; encourage employees to ask questions and get advice
	before they act; and report in good faith any violations of the Code or
	situations that could result in violations to the Company&#146;s Chief Legal Officer.
	In addition to employees&#146; and supervisors&#146; responsibilities
	detailed above, senior management has the responsibility to continuously promote
	ethical business conduct, in line with the Company&#146;s values and general business
	principles.
