	An Irish court may also exercise its right
	to refuse enforcement if the U.S. judgment was obtained by fraud, if the judgment violates Irish public policy, if the judgment
	is in breach of natural justice or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment. There is some uncertainty as to whether
	the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based
	on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based
	on those laws. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil

	Innocoll AG, a German stock
	corporation, which had American Depository Shares, or ADSs, listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (&ldquo;Innocoll Germany&rdquo;),
	held an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders in Munich, Germany on January 30, 2016, in which its shareholders considered
	and approved a proposal for a cross-border merger between Innocoll Germany and Innocoll Holdings plc, a public limited company
	formed under Irish law (&ldquo;Innocoll Ireland&rdquo;), with Innocoll Germany being the disappearing entity and Innocoll Ireland
	being the surviving entity in a merger by acquisition (the &ldquo;Merger&rdquo;).

	On March 16, 2016,
	Innocoll Germany merged with Innocoll Ireland by way of a European cross-border merger with Innocoll Ireland being the
	surviving company. Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, we terminated Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADS facility and each cancelled ADS
	effectively became an entitlement to receive one ordinary share of Innocoll Ireland. Holders of Innocoll Germany ordinary
	shares received 13.25 ordinary shares of Innocoll Ireland in respect of each share held of Innocoll Germany. Simultaneous
	with this transaction, Innocoll Ireland listed its ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol
	&ldquo;INNL&rdquo;, which we previously used for Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADSs. The Merger effectively resulted in Innocoll
	Ireland becoming the publicly-traded parent of the Innocoll group of companies carrying on the same business as that
	conducted by Innocoll Germany prior to the Merger.

	The tables
	below include a reconciliation of our GAAP results to non-GAAP results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We
	define adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share as basic and diluted earnings per share excluding share based payments, fair value
	expense on warrants and reversal of impairment of property, plant and equipment. We believe adjusted non-GAAP
	earnings per share is meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial condition and results. We believe that non-GAAP earnings per share excluding these non-cash items may
	provide securities analysts, investors and other interested parties with a useful measure of our operating performance and cash
	requirements. Disclosure in this annual report of non-GAAP earnings per share, which is a non-IFRS financial measure, is intended
	as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. Non-GAAP earnings
	per share should not be considered as an alternative to earnings per share, profit (loss) or any other performance measure derived
	in accordance with IFRS. Our presentation of adjusted earnings per share should not be construed to imply that our future results
	will be unaffected by unusual non-cash or non-recurring items.

	For the year ended December 31, 2015
	the reconciliation primarily relates to non-cash expenses in the amount of &euro;4.8 million with respect to
	share-based compensation, &euro;3.7 million with respect to fair value expense on warrants and (&euro;3.9) million with
	respect to the reversal of impairment of property, plant and equipment. On a non-GAAP-basis, the net loss for the year ended
	December 31, 2015 was &euro;38.5 million, or &euro;22.9 per share of Innocoll AG, compared to a net loss of &euro;9.3

	Our rate of expenses will continue to increase

	As a result, we will be required to seek additional sources of capital during the next 12 months or restrict certain of our expenditures
	to conserve capital and extend our resources. Our need for additional capital will depend significantly on the level and timing
	of regulatory approval and product sales, as well as the extent to which we choose to establish collaboration, co-promotion, distribution
	or other similar agreements for our products and product candidates. Moreover, changing circumstances may cause us to spend cash

	Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that believed
	their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have failed to achieve similar results
	in later clinical trials, or have ultimately failed to obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates. Many products that

	While physicians in the United States may choose,
	and are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product&rsquo;s labeling, and for uses that
	differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote our products is
	narrowly limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. &ldquo;Off-label&rdquo; uses are common across
	medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities
	in the United States generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities
	do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. Although recent court decisions
	suggest that certain off-label promotional activities may be protected under the First Amendment, the scope of any such protection
	is unclear. Moreover, while we intend to promote our products consistent with what we believe to be the approved indication for
	our drugs, the FDA may disagree. If the FDA determines that our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA&rsquo;s regulations
	or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow
	FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters,
	bring an enforcement action against us, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or institute
	fines or civil fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any

	In addition, we were unable to achieve certain
	primary efficacy endpoints in connection with the Phase 2 clinical studies for our two lead product candidates, XaraColl and Cogenzia.
	For example, in our two Phase 2 trials for XaraColl, which enrolled 53 and 50 patients, respectively, our primary endpoints were
	total consumption of opioid analgesia and reduction of pain based on patients&rsquo; SPI scores, respectively. Over the first 24
	hours post operation, XaraColl-treated patients experienced significantly less pain in study 1 with a XaraColl dose of 100 mg (44%
	reduction; p = 0.001) but showed merely a trend towards significance for pain reduction in study 2 with a XaraColl dose of 200
	mg (22% reduction; p = 0.080). Following a change in guidance we received from the FDA in July 2015, we discontinued the use of
	integrated endpoints in our Phase 3 trials for XaraColl employing a statistical analysis known as the Silverman Method, and instead
	chose SPI as our primary endpoint for both XaraColl trials. In addition, we plan to conduct both our Phase 3 trials using a 300
	mg dose of XaraColl, a dose that was not tested in our Phase 2 trials. Since bupivacaine is believed to work locally by blocking
	the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses and it is considered dose dependent, we believe a higher dose should increase
	the local analgesic effect, even though this dose-related response is not initially supported by the results of our Phase 2 trials,
	which involved small patient populations. We may fail to reach these endpoints and demonstrate efficacy for XaraColl.

	In our Phase 2 trial for Cogenzia involving
	56 patients, Cogenzia (50 mg or 200 mg) was applied daily for up to four weeks in combination with systemic antibiotic therapy
	for the treatment of moderately-infected diabetic foot ulcers with the control group receiving systemic therapy alone. The primary
	efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical outcome of&thinsp;&thinsp;&thinsp; &ldquo;clinical cure&rdquo;
	on a study visit on day 7 of treatment. Efficacy versus the control group was not achieved. However, based on the modified intent-to-treat
	population, 100% of the patients who received Cogenzia and who completed the trial achieved a clinical cure two weeks after completion
	of treatment (test-of-cure date), compared to just 70% of patients who received systemic antibiotic therapy alone, which was a
	statistically significant difference (p = 0.024). Although we have selected a clinical cure measured 10&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;14
	days after the last dose of treatment has been administered as our primary endpoint for our COACT Phase 3 trials for Cogenzia,
	we may fail to reach these endpoints and demonstrate efficacy for Cogenzia.

	In addition, our completed clinical trials
	involved a small patient population. Because of the small sample size, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative
	of future results in a larger and more diverse patient population. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our
	product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate
	and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the filing
	of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.

	We must comply with federal, state and foreign

	regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions where we do business. These requirements include, among other things, quality control,
	quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. For our medical device products, we are required to comply

	Our facility has not yet been inspected by

	foreign regulatory authorities at any time may implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing
	standards for manufacture, packaging, testing of or other activities related to our products. For our marketed medical device products,
	the FDA audits compliance with the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities.
	The FDA may conduct inspections or audits at any time. Similar audit rights exist in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions. Any
	failure to comply with applicable cGMP, QSR and other regulations may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production,
	product seizure or recall, imposition of a consent decree, or withdrawal of product approval, and would limit the availability
	of our product. Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed also could result
	in significant consequences, including adverse health consequences, injury or death to patients, costly recall procedures, re-stocking
	costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims. If we are required to find a new manufacturer or supplier,
	the process would likely require prior FDA and/or equivalent foreign regulatory authority approval, and would be very time consuming.
	An inability to continue manufacturing adequate supplies of our products at our facility in Saal, Germany, could result in a disruption
	in the supply of our products. We have licensed the commercial rights in specified foreign territories to market and sell our products.
	Under those licenses, we have obligations to manufacture commercial product for our commercial partners. If we are unable to fill

	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the

	each desired indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls
	for the product and its components, and draft labeling. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process,

	any approval for commercial sale of our product candidates, certain changes to the product, such as changes in manufacturing processes

	Before we can market or sell a new regulated
	product or a significant modification to an existing product in the United States, we must obtain either marketing clearance under
	Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, from
	the FDA, unless an exemption from premarket clearance and approval applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine
	that a proposed device is &ldquo;substantially equivalent&rdquo; to a device legally on the market, known as a &ldquo;predicate&rdquo;
	device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing.
	Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the
	safety and effectiveness of the device based on extensive clinical data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that
	are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices. Products that are
	approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. Similarly, some modifications made
	to products cleared through a 510(k) premarket notification submission may require a new 510(k) submission, including possibly
	with clinical data. Before we can offer our device products to any of the 31 nations within the EU and the European Free Trade
	Association, we must first satisfy the requirements for CE Mark clearance, a conformity mark that signifies a product has met all
	criteria of the relevant EU directives, especially in the areas of safety and performance. The process of obtaining regulatory
	clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances
	or approvals on a timely basis, or at all for our proposed products. The initial European CE certificate for CollaGUARD was valid
	from October 7, 2011 to July 26, 2015.

	The initial European CE certificate for CollaGUARD
	was valid from October 7, 2011 to July 26, 2015. In accordance with normal practice for device recertification, we compiled an
	updated Design Dossier and submitted this to our European Notified Body (T&Uuml;V S&Uuml;D, Munich, Germany) in December 2014.
	As part of our application for recertification, we included an updated literature-based Clinical Evaluation Report and a Post Market
	Clinical Follow-up (or PMCF) Plan, which rationalized the objectives of our ongoing clinical investigations in accordance with
	the current 2012 European Guideline for PMCF studies. However, prior to the expiration of the original certificate, the Notified
	Body requested that we revise our PMCF plan to additionally include a direct clinical comparison of CollaGUARD&rsquo;s performance
	and safety compared to another CE-certified adhesion barrier. We do not believe that current European medical device regulations
	specifically require that our PMCF plan includes such a clinical comparison. In March 2016, we met with the Notified Body to seek
	clarification. At the meeting, T&Uuml;V S&Uuml;D agreed that current European medical device regulations do not specifically require
	that our PMCF plan includes such a clinical comparison, and agreed with our proposal for an updated PMCF based on the pilot clinical
	study in open myomectomy patients, as was agreed with FDA at the pre-IDE meeting. Provided T&Uuml;V S&Uuml;D determines that the
	clinical data from the U.S. pilot study are supportive, then recertification would be possible at that time based on an updated
	Technical Dossier and Clinical Evaluation. Until a new CE-certificate has been issued, we will not supply CollaGUARD to our marketing
	partners for sale in Europe or other affected territories.

	In both the United States and certain foreign

	to sell our products profitably. In particular, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 revised
	the payment methodology for many products under Medicare in the United States, which has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement.
	In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010,
	or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was enacted. This expansion in the government&rsquo;s role in the U.S. healthcare industry

	Other legislative changes have been proposed
	and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011,
	among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked
	with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required
	goals, thereby triggering the legislation&rsquo;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions
	of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer
	Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions
	of the Budget Control Act of 2011. On March 1, 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration, and on
	April 1, 2013, the 2% Medicare payment reductions went into effect. The ATRA also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments
	to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations
	period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

	We have engaged third-party CROs in connection
	with our Phase 3 clinical trials for our product candidates and will continue to engage such CROs in the future. We rely heavily
	on these parties for execution of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we
	are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and
	scientific standards, and our reliance on our CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are
	required to comply with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP requirements, which are a collection of regulations enforced by
	the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development in order to protect the health,
	safety and welfare of patients and assume the integrity of clinical data. cGCP are also intended to protect the health, safety
	and welfare of study subjects through requirements such as informed consent. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through
	periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these CROs fail to comply with
	applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable
	foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.
	We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with
	the cGCP regulations. In addition, for drugs, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under current Good Manufacturing
	Practice, or cGMP, regulations and will require a large number of test subjects. For our devices, clinical trials must use product
	manufactured in compliance with design controls under the QSR. Our failure or any failure by our CROs to comply with these regulations
	or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval
	process. Moreover, we may be implicated if any of our CROs violate federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations,

	or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they
	obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our

	In addition, the patent applications that we
	own or that we may license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other foreign countries. Even if the
	patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such
	patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications
	may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength
	of protection provided by the issued patents and patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened,
	it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates.
	Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates
	under patent protection would be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential
	for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product
	candidates. Furthermore, for applications in which all claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference
	proceeding can be provoked by a third-party or instituted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, to determine
	who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. For applications containing
	a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is greater level of uncertainty in the patent law with the passage
	of the America Invents Act (2012) which brings into effect significant changes to the U.S. patent laws that are yet untried and
	untested, and which introduces new procedures for challenging pending patent applications and issued patents. A primary change
	under this reform is creating a &ldquo;first to file&rdquo; system in the U.S. This will require us to be cognizant going forward
	of the time from invention to filing of a patent application.

	In addition to the protection afforded by patents,

	that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we require all of our employees
	to assign their inventions to us to the extent permitted by law, and require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any
	third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements,
	we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors
	will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques.
	Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the
	laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property
	both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized material disclosure of our intellectual property

	avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving
	patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings

	proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Recently, following U.S. patent reform, new procedures including

	and post grant review have been implemented. As stated above, this reform is untried and untested and will bring uncertainty to

	which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. As the biotechnology and

	Third parties may assert that we are employing
	their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims
	to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates.
	Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result
	in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim
	that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patent is held by a court of competent jurisdiction

	product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the product candidate unless

	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation
	generally is considered a U.S. corporation if it is created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States
	or of any state thereof or the District of Columbia. Entities treated as U.S. corporations are generally subject to U.S. federal
	income tax on their worldwide income, and U.S. reporting and withholding tax rules may apply to dividends that they pay. Because
	we were formed and organized under the law of Germany, we would ordinarily not be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes
	as a U.S. corporation. Section 7874 of the Code, however, contains special rules that could result in a non-U.S. corporation being
	taxed as a U.S. corporation for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes where the corporation, directly or indirectly, re-domiciles
	from the U.S. to another country. Under Section 7874 of the Code, as a result of our re-domiciling from the U.S. to Germany in
	2013 (the &ldquo;2013 Transaction&rdquo;), we would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless
	our &ldquo;expanded affiliated group&rdquo; (&ldquo;EAG&rdquo;) is treated as having &ldquo;substantial business activities&rdquo;
	in Germany. While we believe that we satisfied this &ldquo;substantial business activities&rdquo; test at the time of the 2013
	Transaction (and, thus, should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes), due to the complexity
	of certain aspects of the law and the very fact-specific nature of the inquiry, there is no assurance that the IRS will not challenge
	our determination. Further, the IRS has issued recent guidance in Notice 2015-79 that provides that an EAG cannot meet the substantial
	business activities test with respect to a foreign country unless the foreign acquiring corporation is a tax resident of that
	foreign country. This new requirement for the substantial business activities test is effective for acquisitions completed on
	or after November&nbsp;19, 2015. However, Notice 2015-79 also states that no inference is intended regarding the treatment under
	current law of any transaction described in Notice 2015-79 and that the IRS may challenge such transactions under applicable Code
	sections or judicial doctrines. In addition, there have been proposals to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence and
	there could be prospective or retroactive legislative changes to Section 7874 of the Code that would result in us being treated
	as a U.S. corporation. Further, we have re-domiciled in 2016 to Ireland. If the Merger is treated as a related transaction
	to the 2013 Transaction, then we would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless our EAG is
	treated as having substantial business activities in Ireland. In that case, we would not satisfy the substantial business activities
	test in Ireland, and thus, we would be treated as a U.S. corporation, even if we would have met the substantial business activities
	test had we remained a German corporation. Due to the complexity of certain aspects of the law and the very fact-specific nature
	of the inquiry, there is no assurance that the IRS will not successfully challenge our determination. If we are treated as a U.S.
	corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, we could be liable for substantial U.S. federal taxes in addition to German and Irish
	taxes. In addition, our investors could be subject to U.S. withholding tax (including under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance
	Act) on the receipt of dividends from us. See the US tax discussion for the consequences to an investor if we were treated as
	a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

	it entered into with DTC. Innocoll Ireland&rsquo;s post-Merger constitution provides that, if stamp duty resulting
	from the transfer of Innocoll Ireland ordinary shares, which would otherwise be payable by the transferee, is paid by Innocoll
	Ireland or any subsidiary of Innocoll Ireland on behalf of or as agent for the transferee, then in those circumstances, Innocoll
	Ireland shall on its behalf or on behalf of any such subsidiary, be entitled to (i) seek reimbursement of the stamp duty from the
	transferor or transferee (at Innocoll Ireland&rsquo;s or relevant subsidiary&rsquo;s discretion), (ii) set-off the stamp duty against
	any dividends payable to the transferor or transferee (at Innocoll Ireland&rsquo;s or relevant subsidiary&rsquo;s discretion) and
	(iii) to claim a first and permanent lien on the shares on which stamp duty has been paid by Innocoll Ireland or any subsidiary
	for the amount of stamp duty paid. Innocoll Ireland&rsquo;s lien shall extend to all dividends paid on those shares.

	We are currently

	the United States or (b) (i) a majority of our executive officers or directors may not be United States citizens or residents,
	(ii) more than fifty-percent (50%) of our assets cannot be located in the United States and (iii) our business must be administered
	principally outside the United States. A foreign private issuer must determine its status on the last business day of its most
	recently completed second fiscal quarter. We expect to lose our status as a foreign private issuer, effective as of June 30, 2016.
	If a foreign private issuer no longer satisfies these requirements, it will become subject to U.S. domestic reporting requirements
	on the first day of its fiscal year immediately succeeding such determination. If we lost this status, we would be required to
	comply with the Exchange Act reporting and other requirements applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, which are more detailed and

	persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible, or may be very difficult, to serve process
	on such persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability
	provisions of the securities laws of the United States. In addition, it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained
	in the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws.
	We have been advised by William Fry, our Irish counsel, that the United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing
	for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.

	An Irish court will also exercise its right
	to refuse enforcement if the U.S. judgment was obtained by fraud, if the judgment violates Irish public policy, if the judgment
	is in breach of natural justice or if it is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment. There is some uncertainty as to whether

	As a company whose securities commenced trading

	did not previously incur. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and
	related rules implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Market have imposed various requirements on public companies, including
	requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. These costs will increase at the time we

	requirements. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.
	Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more

	qualified persons to serve on our board or its committees or on our management board. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy

	The Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls
	and procedures. In particular, we are required, beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, under Section
	404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting
	to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control
	over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of
	any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered
	public accounting firm. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control
	over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim
	financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally
	requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over
	financial reporting. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take
	advantage of the exemption permitting us not to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.
	At the time when we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report
	that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our
	remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future.

	On March 16, 2016, Innocoll AG, a German stock
	corporation, with American Depository Shares, or ADSs, listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, merged with Innocoll Holdings plc,
	a public limited company formed under Irish law, by way of a European cross-border merger with Innocoll Ireland being the surviving
	company. Prior to the merger Innocoll Holdings plc was a dormant company with minimal legally required share capital and related
	debtor on the statement of financial position. Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, we terminated Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADS
	facility and each cancelled ADS effectively became an entitlement to receive one ordinary share of Innocoll Ireland. Holders of
	Innocoll Germany ordinary shares received 13.25 ordinary shares of Innocoll Ireland in respect of each share held of Innocoll
	Germany. Simultaneous with this transaction, Innocoll Ireland listed its ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Market under the
	symbol &ldquo;INNL&rdquo;, which we previously used for Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADSs. The Merger effectively resulted in Innocoll
	Ireland becoming the publicly-traded parent of the Innocoll group of companies carrying on the same business as that conducted

	Our first lead product candidate, XaraColl,
	is an implantable, bioresorbable collagen sponge that we designed to provide sustained post-operative pain relief through controlled
	delivery of bupivacaine at the surgical site. The current standard of care for the treatment of post-operative pain relies heavily
	on the use of opioids supplemented by other classes of pain medications, the combination of which is known as multi-modal pain
	therapy. However, 75% of patients receiving standard treatments still report inadequate post-operative pain relief and many patients
	report adverse events from these medications. Opioid-related adverse events, such as nausea, constipation and respiratory depression,
	which are potentially severe, may require additional medications or treatments and prolong a patient&rsquo;s hospital stay, thereby
	increasing overall treatment costs significantly. Additionally, opioids are highly addictive and induce drug resistance and tolerance.
	Given the negative side effects and costs associated with opioid use in particular, there is increasing focus from hospitals, payors
	and regulators on treatments that reduce opioid use in the treatment of post-operative pain.

	XaraColl has been studied in one Phase 1 and
	four completed Phase 2 clinical trials enrolling approximately 184 patients, including 103 patients in two Phase 2 trials in hernia
	repair at doses of 100 mg and 200 mg of bupivacaine. Results from both trials demonstrated that XaraColl reduces both pain intensity
	and opioid consumption with the 200 mg dose resulting in an overall greater combined effect at 48 hours. XaraColl-treated patients
	in the 100 mg dose trial experienced significantly less pain through 24 hours (44% reduction; p = 0.001), 48 hours (37% reduction;
	p = 0.012) and 72 hours (34% reduction; p = 0.030). In our subsequent 200 mg dose trial, XaraColl demonstrated a statistically
	significant reduction in opioid consumption through 24 and 48 hours (44% reduction at 24 hours, p = 0.004, and 36% reduction at
	48 hours, p = 0.042), and demonstrated a statistical trend in reduction in pain intensity through 24 hours (p = 0.080). After the
	revised guidance we received from the FDA in July 2015, we determined that we will rely upon a primary endpoint of summed pain
	intensity, or SPI, in our two Phase 3 trials. Based on the results of our pivotal pharmacokinetic study in which we tested both
	a 200 mg and a 300 mg dose compared to standard bupivacaine infiltration, are running both Phase 3 trials in parallel, focusing
	only on the 300 mg dose. The FDA deemed our single-dose approach acceptable in our recent Type C meeting. Because bupivacaine is
	believed to work locally by blocking the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses and it is considered dose dependent, we
	believe a higher dose should increase the local analgesic effect. In September 2015, the first patient was dosed in both our MATRIX-1
	(Multisite Assessment of PosToperative PainReduction with XaraColl) and MATRIX-2 Phase 3 studies for the treatment of postoperative
	pain following open hernia repair with mesh using XaraColl, Innocoll&rsquo;s surgically implantable and bioresorbable bupivacaine-collagen
	matrix. Our MATRIX Phase 3 studies are two identical randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies to investigate the
	safety and efficacy of XaraColl, with pivotal data anticipated in the first half of 2016. We expect to submit an NDA for XaraColl
	at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016. We intend to build commercial capabilities in the U.S. to effectively support our
	brands, including XaraColl, in the U.S. In Europe, assuming positive data from our MATRIX Phase 3 studies, we plan to work with
	the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to finalize our regulatory pathway based on Scientific Advice received from the EMA in late
	October 2015. We will, however, continue to evaluate the benefits of select partnerships or co-promotion alternatives if we believe
	it is in the best interest of shareholders, and the success of our brands, now or into the future.

	Our second lead product candidate, Cogenzia,
	is a topically applied, bioresorbable collagen sponge for the treatment of DFIs. Cogenzia is designed to release a high dose of
	gentamicin directly at the site of DFIs. There is a significant unmet medical need for more effective treatments of DFIs. Patients
	suffering from DFIs face a high rate of treatment failure, leading to hospitalization, and potentially limb amputation, which has
	a five-year mortality rate as high as 80%. Of the approximately 27 million patients globally who suffered a diabetic foot ulcer
	in 2014, 58%, or approximately 15 million, developed a DFI. DFIs are currently treated with systemic antibiotic therapy. However,
	peripheral vascular disease, or PVD, a frequent comorbidity of diabetes, leads to reduced blood flow to the extremities thereby
	rendering systemic antibiotic therapy less effective in this patient population. Published data demonstrates that systemic antibiotics
	have a treatment failure rate of approximately 30%. Patients with a DFI face hospitalization risk that is more than 55 times higher
	and risk of amputation more than 150 times higher than diabetic patients with uninfected foot ulcers. The direct cost of an amputation
	associated with the diabetic foot is estimated to be between $30,000 and $60,000, plus between $43,000 and $60,000 in costs for
	follow-up care over the next three years. In addition, major amputation is associated with mortality rates as high as 40% within
	one year and 80% within five years. We believe Cogenzia, when used in combination with standard systemic antibiotic therapy, addresses
	this significant unmet need and will provide substantially higher infection cure rates than obtained from systemic therapy alone.
	Cogenzia acts by delivering a high dose of gentamicin directly to the wound site at a concentration that achieves broad eradication
	of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, all of which
	may be present in DFIs. Delivering gentamicin topically avoids the toxicity side effects associated with systemic dosing and enables
	the drug to be used in higher concentrations, thus, maximizing its effectiveness across a broader range of bacteria.

	Cogenzia has been studied in a multicenter,
	randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial involving 56 patients with moderately infected DFIs. Cogenzia, administered in conjunction
	with systemic antibiotic therapy, achieved a 100% clinical cure rate compared to 70% cure rate for patients who received systemic
	antibiotic therapy alone, which was a statistically significant difference (p=0.024). In addition, Cogenzia achieved baseline pathogen
	eradication of 100% of all microbes present at the wound site for all patients treated and a reduced time to pathogen eradication
	(both statistically significant: p= 0.038, and p
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF">
	&le;

	0.001, respectively)
	when compared to systemic therapy alone. This is a critically important outcome, because, if approved, these results provide practitioners
	with a comfort level that treatment with Cogenzia results in wounds that not only appear to be free of infection, but actually
	have achieved complete eradication of the pathogens. Treatment with systemic antibiotic therapy alone frequently results in wounds
	that appear to have achieved a clinical cure of infection, but still carry residual pathogens, often leading to rapid reinfection.
	Since a diabetic foot ulcer cannot heal in the presence of pathogens, treatment with Cogenzia has the potential to provide practitioners
	with a more effective wound healing platform. We have confirmed the regulatory path for Cogenzia with the FDA under an SPA, which
	we re-affirmed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our protocols for these trials have also been accepted by the European Medicines
	Agency, or EMA, under the Scientific Advice procedure. We initiated both our COACT (COgenzia Adjuvant for Complete Therapy) trials
	in the second quarter of 2015 with pivotal data expected in the third quarter of 2016 if the data is sufficient. We expect to submit
	an NDA in the fourth quarter of 2016 and we will also seek approval from the EMA for Cogenzia at that time. In June 2015, Cogenzia
	received Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, designation for the adjunctive treatment of moderate and severe diabetic
	foot infection from the FDA. This designation is a key provision of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act,
	approved by Congress in 2012 to increase the incentives for drug manufacturers to produce new antibiotics for serious and hard-to-treat
	bacterial and fungal infections. QIDP designation for a drug adds an additional five years of market exclusivity, which means that
	the company that brings the drug into commercial use is protected from generic competitors for that period. For Cogenzia, that
	should result in eight years of data exclusivity in the United States, which would include three years of exclusivity for new clinical
	investigations that were essential for approval. QIDP designation also provides potential access to priority review of marketing
	applications and eligibility for fast track and priority review designations by the FDA. We expect to pursue a priority review
	designation for Cogenzia. A priority review designation means that the FDA&rsquo;s goal is to take action on an application within
	6 months, compared to 10 months under standard review. However, QIDP Designation for Cogenzia does not guarantee priority review
	designation by the FDA.

	primary care physicians and podiatrists. Cogenzia has been approved in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Jordan, Mexico, Russia and
	Saudi Arabia. We plan to enter into partnerships to market and distribute Cogenzia in countries where we do not intend to establish
	our own sales force. We have filed five patent applications for Cogenzia in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and the United States,

	CollaGUARD is our translucent, bioresorbable
	collagen film for the prevention of post-operative adhesions in multiple surgical applications, including digestive, colorectal,
	gynecological and urological surgeries. The global market for anti-adhesion products is difficult to accurately measure, but it
	was estimated at approximately $1.0billion in 2014. We believe that CollaGUARD&rsquo;s unique combination of features for optimal
	handling, ease-of-use, hemostatic properties and anti-adhesion performance sets it apart from its competitors. Unlike other competitive
	products, CollaGUARD can be used in both open and laparoscopic procedures. CollaGUARD is highly robust and can withstand suturing
	or stapling if required during a procedure and is fully biodegradable and is designed to be safely and completely resorbed over
	approximately three to five weeks post implantation. CollaGUARD is also translucent which allows for constant visibility of the
	surgical field. In addition, CollaGUARD is highly stable at room temperature and has up to a five-year shelf life.

	CollaGUARD is regulated as a Class III device
	in the United States and we expect it will require a single pivotal clinical trial to support premarket approval, or PMA, by the
	FDA. In the first quarter of 2015, we initiated a second pilot efficacy study in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic
	adhesiolysis. However, we decided to terminate the second pilot efficacy study in favor of a planned pilot efficacy study in patients
	undergoing myomectomy via open laparotomy to be performed in the U.S. under an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE. We anticipate
	that data from this pilot study will help us to finalize the design of the U.S. pivotal study protocol. In the fourth quarter of
	2015 we completed a pilot clinical study for CollaGUARD, run in the Netherlands, in patients undergoing intrauterine adhesiolysis
	via operative hysteroscopy. A clinical study report for this study confirmed the ease of use and safety for CollaGUARD in this
	patient population. We held our pre-IDE submission meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2016, in which we agreed on a non-clinical
	development plan that will be completed and reported prior to our filing a full IDE package, which we expect to do in the third
	quarter of 2016, with the Pilot (Feasibility) Clinical Study to be initiated immediately after approval. CollaGUARD has been approved
	in 12 countries in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East and we have launched the product in certain of these territories through
	our established distribution partners, such as Takeda, which launched and distributed CollaGUARD in Russia in 2014 and received
	approval in the first quarter of 2015 for the product in Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

	The initial European CE certificate for CollaGUARD
	was valid from October 7, 2011 to July 26, 2015. In accordance with normal practice for device recertification, we compiled an
	updated Design Dossier and submitted this to our European Notified Body (T&Uuml;V S&Uuml;D, Munich, Germany) in December 2014.
	As part of our application for recertification, we included an updated literature-based Clinical Evaluation Report and a Post Market
	Clinical Follow-up (or PMCF) Plan, which rationalized the objectives of our ongoing clinical investigations in accordance with
	the current 2012 European Guideline for PMCF studies. However, prior to the expiration of the original certificate, the Notified
	Body requested that we revise our PMCF plan to additionally include a direct clinical comparison of CollaGUARD&rsquo;s performance
	and safety compared to another CE-certified adhesion barrier. We do not believe that current European medical device regulations
	specifically require that our PMCF plan includes such a clinical comparison. In March 2016, we met with the Notified Body to seek
	clarification. At the meeting, T&Uuml;V S&Uuml;D agreed that current European medical device regulations do not specifically require
	that our PMCF plan includes such a clinical comparison, and agreed with our proposal for an updated PMCF based on the pilot clinical
	study in open myomectomy patients, as was agreed with FDA at the pre-IDE meeting. Provided T&Uuml;V S&Uuml;D determines that the
	clinical data from the U.S. pilot study are supportive, then recertification would be possible at that time based on an updated
	Technical Dossier and Clinical Evaluation. Until a new CE-certificate has been issued, we will not supply CollaGUARD to our marketing
	partners for sale in Europe or other affected territories.

	of postoperative pain following open hernia repair with mesh using XaraColl, Innocoll&rsquo;s surgically implantable and bioresorbable
	bupivacaine-collagen matrix. Our MATRIX Phase 3 studies are two identical randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies
	to investigate the safety and efficacy of XaraColl, with pivotal data anticipated in the first half of 2016. If the data is positive,
	we expect to submit an NDA for XaraColl in the second half of 2016. We intend to build commercial capabilities in the U.S. to effectively
	support our brands, including XaraColl, in the U.S. In Europe, assuming positive data from our MATRIX Phase 3 studies, we plan
	to work with the EMA to finalize our regulatory pathway based on Scientific Advice received from the EMA in late October 2015.
	We will, however, continue to evaluate the benefits of select partnerships or co-promotion alternatives if we believe it is in
	the best interest of shareholders, and the success of our brands, now or into the future. We are planning to enter into distribution

	XaraColl was developed using our proven and
	commercialized collagen sponge matrix technology, CollaRx. XaraColl is an intraoperative implant that is fully bioresorbable and
	delivers the local anesthetic, bupivacaine, directly to the surgical site. We designed XaraColl to provide post-operative analgesia
	for up to 72 hours after surgery. By placing XaraColl directly in contact with the traumatized tissue surfaces, surgeons can sustain
	an effective drug concentration at both the visceral and incisional sites of surgical wound pain.

	There are approximately 46 million inpatient
	and 53 million outpatient surgeries performed in the United States each year. Traditionally, the standard of care for the treatment
	of post-operative pain relied heavily on the use of opioids supplemented by other classes of pain medications and delivery mechanisms,
	including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, acetaminophen and wound infiltration with local anesthetics, the combination
	of which is known as multi-modal pain therapy. However, 75% of patients receiving standard treatments still report inadequate post-operative
	pain relief and many patients report adverse events from these medications. Unrelieved acute pain can lead to longer post-operative
	recovery time, delayed ambulation, higher incidence of surgery related complications, increased intensive care unit and hospital
	length of stays, hospital readmission, progression from acute to chronic pain and reduced levels of daily functioning. The table
	below summarizes the properties of various options available for the treatment of post-operative pain.

	Opioids
</I>
	. Opioids, such as morphine, are the mainstay of post-operative pain management, but are associated with a variety
	of unwanted and potentially severe side effects, leading healthcare practitioners to seek opioid-sparing strategies for their patients.
	Opioid side effects include sedation, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, headache, itching, constipation, cognitive impairment,
	respiratory depression and death. Most importantly, opioids are highly addictive and induce drug resistance and tolerance. These
	side effects may require additional medications or treatments and prolong a patient&rsquo;s stay in the post-anesthesia care unit
	and the hospital or ambulatory surgery center, thereby increasing overall treatment costs significantly.

	PCA and Elastomeric Bag Systems.
</I>
	Opioids are often administered intravenously through patient-controlled analgesia,
	or PCA, systems in the immediate post-operative period. PCA post-operative pain management for three days can cost up to $500,
	excluding the costs of treating opioid complications. In an attempt to reduce opioid consumption, many hospitals employ elastomeric
	bag systems designed to deliver bupivacaine to the surgical area through a catheter over a period of time. This effectively extends
	the duration of bupivacaine in the post-operative site, but has significant shortcomings. PCA systems and elastomeric bag systems
	are clumsy and difficult to use, which may delay patient ambulation and introduce catheter-related issues, including infection.
	In addition, PCA systems and elastomeric bags require significant additional hospital resources to implement and monitor.

	NSAIDs

	. NSAIDs are considered to be useful alternatives to opioids for acute pain relief because they do not produce
	respiratory depression or constipation. Despite these advantages, the use of injectable NSAIDs, such as ketorolac and ibuprofen,
	is severely limited in the post-operative period because they increase the risk of bleeding and gastrointestinal and renal complications.

	Acetaminophen
</I>
	. Oral and suppository formulations of acetaminophen have long been used to manage pain, including pain
	in a post-operative setting. Recently, the FDA approved an IV formulation of acetaminophen, Ofirmev, for the management of post-operative
	pain to avoid the slow onset of the analgesic effects after oral delivery. Acetaminophen is considered not only a viable alternative
	to NSAIDs, but also can be combined with NSAIDs for an additive effect. However, in any formulation, acetaminophen increases the
	risk of liver damage or failure which limits the ability to administer it at high dosages or over an extended period of time.

<I>
	Local Anesthetics
</I>
	. Treatment of post-operative pain typically begins at the end of surgery, with local anesthetics,
	such as bupivacaine, administered by local infiltration. Though this infiltration provides a base platform for the treatment of
	post-operative pain for the patient, efficacy of conventional bupivacaine and other available local anesthetics is limited, lasting
	approximately eight hours or less. As local infiltration is not practical after the surgery is complete, and as surgical pain is
	greatest in the first few days after surgery, additional therapeutics are required to manage post-operative pain.

	. Given the negative side effects and the costs associated with opioid use in particular, there
	is an increasing focus from hospitals, payors and regulators on treatments that reduce opioid use for the treatment of post-operative
	pain. We believe that XaraColl, in combination with NSAIDs, acetaminophen and/or local anesthetics, has the potential to become
	a cornerstone in the treatment of post-operative pain, focusing on opioid reduction or elimination.

	In the first trial, we randomized 53 patients
	to receive either two XaraColl 50 mg sponges for a total dosage of 100 mg bupivacaine (24 patients) or two placebo sponges (29
	patients). In all cases, one sponge was placed beneath the hernia repair mesh and the second placed below the laparotomy incision.
	During patient recovery, immediate post-operative pain was treated with intravenous morphine at incremental doses of 1 to 2 mg,
	as needed to achieve pain control. Once patients could tolerate oral medication, they were provided with opioid tablets as rescue
	analgesia and instructed to take only if necessary for breakthrough pain. Patients assessed their post-operative pain intensity
	after aggravated movement (cough) on a 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale at regular intervals through 72 hours. Their use of supplementary
	opioid medication was also recorded. Safety was assessed through 30 days. XaraColl-treated patients in this first trial reported
	significantly less pain through 24&nbsp;hours (44% reduction; p = 0.001), 48 hours (37% reduction; p = 0.012) and 72 hours (34%
	reduction; p = 0.030). They also took less opioid medication through each time point (25%, 16% and 17% reduction, respectively),
	although these reductions were not statistically significant (p = 0.123, 0.359, and 0.396, respectively).

	Based on the safety and efficacy results we
	observed at the 100 mg dose, we conducted a second multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled hernia repair trial, implanting
	two XaraColl 100 mg sponges for a total dosage of 200 mg. We enrolled 50&nbsp;patients, 25 randomized to each group, and performed
	the same efficacy analyses as the first trial. In this second trial, XaraColl-treated patients took significantly less opioid medication
	through 24 hours (44% reduction; p = 0.004) and 48 hours (36% reduction; p = 0.042), with a trend towards statistical significance
	at 72 hours (31% reduction; p = 0.094). Of the patients that received XaraColl, 16% did not require any opioid rescue analgesia,
	compared to 0% in the control group. Although XaraColl-treated patients in the 200 mg also reported less pain (22%, 18%, and 19%
	reduction through 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively) these results were not statistically significant. These results are in contrast
	to the pain intensity results achieved in the 100 mg trial where statistical significance was demonstrated for this parameter.

	Patients experiencing an opioid-related adverse
	event in the United States had a 55% longer hospital stay than those without such events, a 47% higher hospitalization cost, a
	36% increased risk of 30-day readmission and a 3.4 times greater risk of in-patient mortality in 2013. We also observed that at
	the higher 200 mg dose, 16% (4/25) of patients did not require any opioid rescue analgesia throughout the 72 hours, compared to
	0% in the corresponding placebo control group. Accompanying the significantly reduced use of rescue analgesia, we also observed
	a 52% reduction in the number of patients who reported any adverse event commonly associated with consumption of opioids. In addition,
	there was an increase of 102% in time until patients first used rescue medication following discharge from the post-anesthesia
	care unit. Furthermore, we found that nausea events reported by XaraColl-treated patients were generally less severe and of shorter
	duration, while more patients in the control group received antiemetic medication for nausea. We believe that increasing the dosage
	of XaraColl from 200 mg to 300 mg in Phase 3, may result in a higher number of patients avoiding taking opioid medication than
	was observed in Phase 2 as well as a further reduction in opioid-related adverse events.

	In 2008, for the purpose of comparing the clinical
	performance of XaraColl with the then-leading, commercially-available product, we designed and conducted a randomized, multicenter
	trial to compare the efficacy of XaraColl with ON-Q. Prior studies had reported reduced use of opioid analgesia in patients fitted
	with ON-Q. However, the device is expensive, requires subsequent removal of the indwelling catheter by nursing/hospital staff and

	total abdominal hysterectomy or similar open gynecological surgery to receive either three XaraColl 50 mg implants (150 mg total
	dose divided between the vaginal vault, the peritoneal incision, and along the rectal sheath), or ON-Q (900 mg bupivacaine continuously
	perfused post-operatively over 72 hours). Following surgery, patients had access to intravenous morphine via a PCA pump as rescue
	analgesia for the first 24 hours and to oral opioid medication thereafter. Cumulative use of opioid analgesia was compared across

	Despite delivering only one-sixth (17%) of
	the total ON-Q bupivacaine dosage, we demonstrated that XaraColl was potentially more effective in providing post-operative analgesia
	than continuous bupivacaine infusion over 72 hours, with statistical trends towards reduced opioid consumption in favor of XaraColl
	through 24, 48 and 72 hours. We believe that by implanting XaraColl at different depths within the surgical wound, we may target

	We conducted an open-label, single site, Phase

	trials study the interactions of a drug and the body in terms of its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Three
	XaraColl 50 mg sponges (150 mg total dose) were implanted; the first over the vaginal vault, the second along the line of peritoneal
	closure, and the third along the line of rectal sheath closure. Serum samples were obtained through 96 hours for pharmacokinetic
	analysis and safety was assessed through 30 days. Patients were maintained on a non-opioid oral analgesic regimen according to
	institutional standards through 96 hours and also given access to intravenous morphine via PCA during the first 24 hours. Pain
	intensity was assessed at regular intervals using a 100&nbsp;mm visual analog scale. XaraColl exhibited a biphasic and sustained
	release pharmacokinetic profile with an early peak typically observed within the first 2 hours followed by a second, generally
	higher peak up to 24 hours later. The individual maximum serum concentrations ranged from 0.14 to 0.44 &mu;g/ml (mean 0.22 &mu;g/ml),
	which are well below the accepted neuro- and cardio-toxicity thresholds for bupivacaine. Patient use of PCA morphine for breakthrough

	in this group were sustained above the peak level attained in both the bupivacaine 150 mg infiltration and XaraColl 200 mg groups
	from 1 hour through 24 hours after implantation/administration of study drug. At 72 hours and 96 hours, mean plasma concentrations
	of bupivacaine in the XaraColl 300 mg were nearly double that of the XaraColl 200 mg group. The highest individual bupivacaine
	plasma concentration in this study was 777 ng/mL for a subject in the XaraColl 300 mg group. This concentration is 2.5 times lower
	than the threshold concentration that has been associated with signs and symptoms of bupivacaine toxicity (2000 ng/mL). Areas under
	the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) were dose proportional for XaraColl 200 mg and XaraColl 300 mg relative to the bupivacaine
	150 mg infiltration. The relative maximum concentrations (Cmax) for XaraColl 200 mg and XaraColl 300 mg were approximately 80%

	In September 2015, we commenced both our MATRIX-1
	and MATRIX-2 Phase 3 studies for the treatment of postoperative pain following open hernia repair with mesh using XaraColl, Innocoll&rsquo;s
	surgically implantable and bioresorbable bupivacaine-collagen matrix. The MATRIX Phase 3 studies are two identical randomized,
	placebo-controlled, double-blind studies to investigate the safety and efficacy of a surgically implantable and resorbable bupivacaine-collagen
	matrix. Each study is expected to enroll approximately 300 patients aged 18 and older in the United States. Patients with a unilateral
	inguinal hernia undergoing open hernioplasty with mesh placement will be treated in one of two arms per study with either three
	100 mg XaraColl matrices for a total dose of 300 mg of bupivacaine hydrochloride, or three placebo matrices. The matrices are placed
	at the site of the hernia repair in order to provide local levels of bupivacaine directly at the location of surgical trauma. The
	primary efficacy endpoint in both Phase 3 studies is SPID (time-weighted sum of pain intensity difference) over 24 hours comparing
	the XaraColl matrix to placebo. Additional endpoints include SPID at 48 and 72 hours as well as total opioid use at 24, 48 and
	72 hours. Safety will be evaluated through the collection of adverse events through 30 days postoperatively. The FDA has approved
	this study protocol and we commenced testing XaraColl at the 300 mg dose in the third quarter of 2015, with pivotal data anticipated
	in the first half of 2016. We previously received topline data from our pivotal pharmacokinetic study in which we tested both a
	200 mg and a 300 mg dose versus standard bupivacaine infiltration which supports the selection of a 300 mg dose of XaraColl to
	be tested in our MATRIX Phase 3 efficacy trials. We had initially planned to conduct our Phase 3 trials using a single, integrated
	endpoint, validated in pain studies, that integrates and weights the patient&rsquo;s pain score and use of rescue analgesia equally,
	known as the Silverman method so that the results can take into account a patient&rsquo;s choice to suffer more pain or take higher
	dosages of rescue analgesia. However, in accordance with recommendations that we received from the FDA in connection with our recent
	Type C meeting, we are not using an integrated endpoint in our Phase 3 trials and instead rely upon a primary endpoint of SPIDfor
	both trials.

	We also increased the number of patients from
	240 to 300 to ensure that the safety database from our studies will include no less than 500 subjects, as requested by the FDA.
	In planning our approach for Phase 3, we carefully considered our Phase 2 data to develop a risk-minimized strategy. We decided
	to conduct our Phase 3 trials exclusively in patients undergoing open hernia repair, where XaraColl has already demonstrated statistically
	significant efficacy in Phase 2. We believe that, given that bupivacaine is believed to work locally by blocking the generation
	and the conduction of nerve impulses and is considered dose dependent, testing a higher dose of 300 mg could lead to further reduction
	in pain intensity and opioid consumption as well as extension of the duration of effective post-operative analgesia.

	our brands, now or into the future. We intend to expand XaraColl into markets outside the United States, including Europe, and

	Cogenzia, is a topically applied, bioresorbable
	collagen sponge for the treatment of DFIs. We designed Cogenzia to release a high dose of gentamicin directly at the site of DFIs.
	After surgical debridement to remove any necrotic tissues, the Cogenzia sponge is applied daily to the DFI and covered with a secondary
	wound dressing. Cogenzia is highly flexible and will take the shape of the wound bed, minimizing exudate build-up. A high local
	concentration of gentamicin would penetrate the wound directly, delivering an optimal concentration of drug precisely where it
	is needed with minimal systemic absorption. The type-1 collagen in Cogenzia, manufactured using our proprietary technologies, is
	a natural and well-established biocompatible material that can help stimulate the growth of new tissue in the wound bed and accelerate
	the natural process of wound healing.

	Gentamicin is typically delivered systemically
	which limits maximum possible dosage levels due to its adverse effects and toxicity risks on patients at higher dosage levels.
	Therefore, it has historically only been used to treat Gram negative bacteria. However, gentamicin&rsquo;s antibacterial efficacy
	is concentration dependent, and at higher dose levels has been shown to provide broad spectrum coverage of both Gram positive and
	Gram negative bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, all of which may be present in DFIs.

	The chart below compares published information
	of the estimated gentamicin concentration levels achievable by delivering gentamicin locally with Cogenzia compared to the peak
	safe serum levels obtained from systemic delivery. In a published study by Stemberger et al., it was demonstrated that gentamicin
	begins to achieve broad spectrum microbial coverage at 16 &mu;g/ml and reaches complete broad spectrum coverage at concentrations
	of &gt;512 &mu;g/ml, both of which exceed the maximum safe peak serum level of gentamicin when delivered systemically (10-12 &mu;g/ml).
	According to a publication by Dr.&nbsp;Benjamin Lipsky et al., Cogenzia is expected to deliver local concentrations of gentamicin
	of approximately 1000 &mu;g/ml, which exceeds the concentration required to achieve broad spectrum coverage facilitating eradication
	of pathogens present at the infected wound site.

	Preliminary data suggests that Cogenzia is
	able to deliver a higher dose of gentamicin locally at the infection site than can be achieved by systemic delivery, providing
	broad spectrum coverage of bacteria safely without the side effects and toxicity risks associated with systemic delivery at higher
	dosage levels, while minimizing the risk of resistance. There are currently no topical agents approved for the treatment of DFIs.
	We believe this topical route of administration, in combination with systemic antibiotic therapy, has the potential to become the
	standard of care first line treatment of all types of DFIs, including mild, moderate and severe infections.

	We filed an IND for Cogenzia in November 2006.
	The clinical protocols for our Phase 3 registration trials were agreed upon with the FDA under an SPA, and have also been accepted
	by the EMA under the Scientific Advice procedure. We initiated the Cogenzia Phase 3 clinical program in both the United States
	and Europe. In June 2015, Cogenzia received QIDP designation for the adjunctive treatment of moderate and severe diabetic foot
	infection from the FDA. This designation is a key provision of the GAIN Act approved by Congress in 2012 to increase the incentives
	for drug manufacturers to produce new antibiotics for serious and hard-to-treat bacterial and fungal infections. QIDP designation
	for a drug adds an additional five years of market exclusivity, which means that the company that brings the drug into commercial
	use is protected from generic competitors for that period. For Cogenzia, that should result in eight years of data exclusivity
	in the United States, which would include three years of exclusivity for new clinical investigations that were essential for approval.
	QIDP designation also provides potential access to priority review of marketing applications and eligibility for fast track and
	priority review designations by the FDA. We expect to pursue a priority review designation for Cogenzia. A priority review designation
	means that the FDA&rsquo;s goal is to take action on an application within 6 months, compared to 10 months under standard review.
	However, QIDP Designation for Cogenzia does not guarantee priority review designation by the FDA. We have also developed an expedited
	path to market in markets that represent a majority of the worldwide diabetes population, and we intend to enter into new commercial
	partnerships for Cogenzia in these markets. We maintain full rights to Cogenzia in the United States and Europe and, upon obtaining
	marketing approval, intend to directly commercialize the product in the United States, and potentially in Europe, using our own
	specialized sales and marketing organization focused on high volume wound treatment centers and podiatrists targeting the highest
	prescribers of antibiotics for the treatment of DFIs in the United States. We have filed five patent applications for Cogenzia
	in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and the United States, all of which are currently in the examination phase. If and when our
	patents are issued, we expect patent protection for Cogenzia in the United States and these other territories through 2031.

	According to the International Diabetes Federation,
	there were about 387 million diabetic patients globally in 2014, projected to increase to 592 million by 2035. Of the approximately
	27 million patients globally who suffered a diabetic foot ulcer in 2014, 58%, or approximately 15.7 million, developed a DFI. DFIs
	are currently treated with systemic antibiotic therapy. However, peripheral vascular disease, or PVD, a frequent comorbidity of
	diabetes, leads to reduced blood flow to the extremities thereby rendering systemic antibiotic therapy less effective in this patient
	population. Published data demonstrate that systemic antibiotic therapy fails approximately 30% of the time in the treatment of
	DFIs. Patients with a DFI face hospitalization risk that is more than 55 times higher and risk of amputation more than 150 times
	higher than diabetic patients with uninfected foot ulcers. The direct cost of an amputation associated with the diabetic foot is
	estimated to be between $30,000 and $60,000, plus between $43,000 and $60,000 in costs for follow-up care over the next three years.
	In addition, major amputation is associated with mortality rates as high as 40% within one year and 80% within five years. We believe
	Cogenzia can offer improvements in patient outcomes and significant costs savings.

	Local antibiotic treatment adjunct to a systemic
	agent can address this major need in DFIs by improving antibacterial efficacy at the wound site leading to a substantially higher
	success rate than that achieved by systemic antibiotic therapy alone. Since a diabetic foot ulcer cannot heal in the presence of
	infection, this higher infection cure rate facilitates more effective healing of the ulcer and substantially reduces the potential
	for amputation. The use of Cogenzia, a gentamicin collagen sponge administered topically, in conjunction with systemic antibiotic
	therapy, to treat DFIs has been supported by several key opinion leaders and authors affiliated with premier DFI institutions such
	as VA Puget Sound Healthcare System; University of Washington; Southern Arizona Limb Salvage Alliance; Kings College Hospital,
	London; Center for Clinical Research, Castro Valley, California; and Pacific Clinical Center, Los Angeles, California.

	In our multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled
	Phase 2 trial involving 36 patients, Cogenzia (50 mg or 200 mg) was applied daily for up to 28 days in combination with systemic
	antibiotic therapy for the treatment of moderately-infected diabetic foot ulcers, with the control group receiving systemic therapy
	alone. Patients were treated for at least 7 days and continued treatment until the investigator determined that all signs and symptoms
	of infection had resolved, up to a maximum of 28 days. A final test-of-cure and safety assessment for each patient was performed
	2 weeks after completion of treatment. The investigator performed clinical assessments at regular study visits while the patient
	was undergoing antibiotic therapy (i.e., days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28) and again at the final two-week follow-up visit. The primary
	efficacy endpoint for this trial was the percentage of patients with a clinical outcome of &ldquo;clinical cure&rdquo; (defined
	as the complete resolution or elimination of infection) at the study visit on day 7 of treatment. This study visit was selected
	as the primary endpoint because statistical calculations suggested that we would need a substantially larger sample size to test
	for treatment superiority at the later study visits. Our primary endpoint of clinical cure at 7 days after treatment, however,
	was not achieved. At the final test-of-cure visit approximately two weeks after completion of treatment, however, all evaluable
	patients in the treatment group achieved clinical cure. Nevertheless, since 100% of the patients who received Cogenzia and who
	completed the trial achieved a clinical cure, the trial results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in cure rate
	at the final test-of-cure visit, despite the relatively small sample size. Below is a summary of the data from this trial based
	on the modified intent-to-treat, or mITT, population, modified to include only patients who had been randomized to the Cogenzia
	and control arms and not earlier terminated from the study for failure to comply with the study inclusion criteria.

	By achieving a complete eradication of all
	pathogens at the wound site at study visits on day 28, as demonstrated by microbiological testing, the use of Cogenzia in DFIs
	prepares the underlying wound for healing. Since diabetic foot ulcers generally cannot heal in the presence of infection, a pathogen
	free wound site provides patients an unmatched opportunity to achieve a complete healing of the ulcer, thereby substantially reducing
	the risk for both reinfection and potential amputation. Treatment by current systemic antibiotic therapy frequently leads to wounds
	that ostensibly appear to be free of infection but still prove to have a high level of residual pathogens. It is clinically meaningful
	that in our Phase 2 trial, Cogenzia achieved both a 100% clinical cure and 100% eradication of all pathogens at the wound site,
	thereby potentially providing practitioners with a high degree of comfort that a wound which appears to be free of infection is
	in fact free of infection. This important outcome, we believe, offers the potential for Cogenzia to become the recognized standard
	of care for the treatment of DFI&rsquo;s. As the risk of reinfection for patients treated by systemic antibiotic therapy alone
	is high, this often results in further courses of antibiotic treatment, along with the potential for hospitalization where IV antibiotics
	are administered. We believe the use of Cogenzia in combination with systemic antibiotic therapy can be much more effective at
	eradicating the infecting pathogens than systemic antibiotic therapy alone, providing for an overall improved patient outcome at
	substantially lower costs than those incurred if hospitalization is required.

	Our Phase 2 trial also demonstrated that Cogenzia
	was safe, well tolerated and conducive to ulcer healing. The proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event was similar
	for the treatment (28.9%) and control (27.8%) groups. The most common adverse events occurring in at least two patients per group
	were infected skin ulcer, tinea pedis and increased blood creatinine level. There were no clinically or statistically significant
	changes in laboratory tests values or vital signs. Most adverse events were mild or moderate, but there were six serious adverse
	events, including five in the Cogenzia treatment group (hypoglycemia, renal failure, cellulitis, tendon rupture and wound hemorrhage),
	all of which resolved, and one in the control group. Only one patient in the treatment group experienced an adverse event (moderate
	renal failure) that was considered definitely or probably related to the trial and resolved by the final visit. One clinically
	improved patient was withdrawn from the trial due to an adverse event (hypoglycemia) that was unrelated to Cogenzia.

	We have initiated two identical, randomized,
	placebo-controlled, blinded trials, enrolling approximately 500 patients each, under our SPA with the FDA, in patients with moderate
	to severe DFIs. Our trial protocols agreed to with the FDA in the SPA, and subsequently reaffirmed in 2014, have also been accepted
	by the EMA under the Scientific Advice procedure. Each trial consists of three arms, (1) Cogenzia, (2) placebo collagen matrix
	or (3) no collagen matrix. In each arm, Cogenzia will be used as adjuvant therapy in combination with a systemic antibiotic. Patients
	will be treated for up to a maximum of 28 days and the investigator will stop the trial treatment if a patient achieves clinical
	cure on or after day 14. The primary endpoint will be clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit approximately 10 days after the last
	dose of treatment has been administered with co-primary endpoints, including (i) Cogenzia compared to placebo and a systemic antibiotic,
	and (ii) Cogenzia compared to a systemic antibiotic alone. Follow-up visits with enrolled patients are scheduled to occur at 10,
	30, 60 and 90 days after the last dose of treatment has been administered to assess ulcer closure and re-infection. Planned secondary
	endpoints include (1) clinical cure time (percentage of patients at each visit), (2) positive clinical response (percentage of
	patients at each visit), (3) pathogen eradication time (percentage of patients at each visit), (4) microbiological outcomes, (5)
	surgical intervention, or (6) amputation and re-infection. We commenced the trials in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, we
	plan to further expand the market opportunity for Cogenzia by conducting additional Phase 2 trials for the prevention of DFIs as
	well as for the treatment of infected, or at risk of infection, wounds such as venous ulcers, burns and bed sores, among others.
	Expansion of the market opportunity for Cogenzia into the prevention of DFIs would widen the potential use of the product across
	the entire diabetic foot ulcer patient population.

	This sales force could also market Cogenzia for other indications such as the prevention of DFIs, if it is approved for such indications.
	Outside of the United States, we have already obtained regulatory approval of Cogenzia in seven countries, Argentina, Australia,

	CollaGUARD is our translucent, bioresorbable
	collagen film for the prevention of post-operative adhesions in multiple surgical applications, including digestive, general, colorectal,
	gynecological and urological surgeries, in both open and laparoscopic approaches. It is approved in 12 countries outside of the
	United States for the prevention of post-operative adhesions and may be used in patients undergoing laparotomy or laparoscopic
	surgeries. When tested in vivo, CollaGUARD increased the probability of remaining adhesion-free by more than six fold (p 0.001)
	and significantly reduced the extent and severity of adhesions (p 0.001) versus no anti-adhesion product. CollaGUARD has been designed
	and engineered with a unique combination of features for optimal handling, ease-of-use, hemostatic properties and anti-adhesion
	performance. The film, which is applied directly to tissue surfaces, is translucent allowing constant visibility of the surgical
	field. It is highly stable at room temperature, does not require any special storage or advanced preparation before use and has
	up to a five-year shelf life.

	The product is non-tacky, non-sticky and can
	be easily rolled for insertion through a trocar when implanted laproscopically. CollaGUARD is also fully biodegradable and is designed
	to be safely and completely resorbed over approximately three to five weeks post implantation. CollaGUARD is available in a wide
	variety of sizes up to 30 x 20 cm and may be cut and sutured if required and, therefore, can be used easily across a broad range
	of surgeries. CollaGUARD is regulated as a Class III device in the United States and we expect it will require a single pivotal
	clinical trial for PMA by the FDA. In the first quarter of 2015, we initiated a second pilot efficacy study in patients undergoing
	gynecological laparoscopic adhesiolysis. However, we decided to terminate the second pilot efficacy study in favor of a planned
	pilot efficacy study in patients undergoing myomectomy via open laparotomy to be performed in the U.S. under an IDE. We anticipate
	that data from this pilot study will help us to finalize the design of the U.S. pivotal study protocol. In the fourth quarter of
	2015 we completed a pilot clinical study for CollaGUARD, run in the Netherlands, in patients undergoing intrauterine adhesiolysis
	via operative hysteroscopy. A clinical study report for this study confirmed the ease of use and safety for CollaGUARD in this
	patient population. We held our pre-IDE submission meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2016, in which we agreed on a non-clinical
	development plan that will be completed and reported prior to our filing a full IDE package, which we expect to do in the third
	quarter of 2016, with the Pilot (Feasibility) Clinical Study to be initiated immediately after approval. We submitted a family
	of patent applications aimed at protecting CollaGUARD on an international basis, including Australia, Canada, Eurasia, Europe,
	Japan, Mexico, and the United States, which is currently in the examination phase. If issued, these patents are expected to expire
	in 2033 or later in the United States.

	Adhesions are fibrous bands of scar tissue
	that abnormally bind together two anatomic surfaces, and can develop naturally after surgery as part of the healing process. Post-surgical
	adhesions occur in almost 95% of patients who have had multiple laparotomies. Complications associated with post-operative adhesions
	can be severe, including chronic abdominal pain, bowl-obstruction, infertility in women, and joint immobilization, among others.
	Adhesions can also make second surgeries more complicated and even dangerous, depending on their extent and severity, as surgeons
	may have difficulties reaching and separating tissues, the median abdominal opening time increases threefold for repeat surgery
	patients, and increased surgical procedure and re-entry time means increased costs and increased risk of infection to the patient.
	Adhesions cause over 40% of all intestinal obstructions and 60% to 70% of small bowel obstructions. Approximately 35% of patients
	who underwent open abdominal or pelvic surgery were readmitted due to adhesion-related problems. In the United States alone, there
	are approximately 350,000 hospitalizations and $2.3 billion spent annually on surgery to remove adhesions formed following gynecologic
	or abdominal surgeries. According to Global Industry Analysts Inc., the global market for anti-adhesion products was estimated
	to be $1.3 billion in 2014. The market is mainly driven by increasing surgeon attention towards anti-adhesion products along with
	the development of new products addressing unmet requirements. The current products available on the market include four basic
	formulations: gels, films, sprays and liquids. Polymeric film is the most widely used anti-adhesion device to separate as well
	as isolate wounded tissues following a surgical procedure. However, existing products have a number of disadvantages including
	poor handling properties, limited efficacy, limitations to applicable surgical settings (i.e., open or laparoscopic procedures)
	and strict product warnings and contraindications. We believe that CollaGUARD has the ability to address these unmet needs and
	become a &ldquo;best-in-class&rdquo; product.

	CollaGUARD is regulated as a Class III device
	in the United States. In our pre-clinical animal trial with CollaGUARD, we have studied the performance, primary and secondary
	endpoints and safety of CollaGUARD in rats. This method is a well-established and well-recognized surrogate for human testing and
	was used to support regulatory approval in Europe and many other countries outside of the United States. The trial was conducted
	in two stages, comparing the safety and performance of CollaGUARD in stage 1 to an untreated control group and in stage 2 to Prevadh
<SUP>
	&reg;
</SUP>
	,
	a commercially available collagen-based adhesion product approved in Europe. Prevadh, which also consists of collagen among other
	component materials, was deemed to be the closest comparison to CollaGUARD among marketed products. In the first trial stage, CollaGUARD
	demonstrated superiority over the control group in both the prevalence and severity of adhesions which was significantly lower
	compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001). In stage 2 of this trial, we demonstrated equivalent outcomes in the prevalence (p
	= 0.625) and severity (p = 0.317) of adhesions between CollaGUARD and Prevadh.

	Because CollaGUARD is regulated as a Class
	III device in the United States, we expect that it will require a single pivotal clinical trial for PMA by the FDA. We held our
	pre-IDE submission meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2016, in which we agreed on a non-clinical development plan that
	will be completed and reported prior to our filing a full IDE package, which we expect to do in the third quarter of 2016, with

	The initial European CE certificate for CollaGUARD
	was valid from October&nbsp;7, 2011 to July&nbsp;26, 2015. In accordance with normal practice for device recertification, we compiled
	an updated Design Dossier and submitted this to our European Notified Body (T&Uuml;V S&Uuml;D, Munich, Germany) in December&nbsp;2014.
	As part of our application for recertification, we included an updated literature-based Clinical Evaluation Report and a Post Market
	Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) Plan, which rationalized the objectives of our ongoing clinical investigations in accordance with the
	current 2012 European Guideline for PMCF studies. However, prior to the expiration of the original certificate, the Notified Body
	requested that we revise our PMCF plan to additionally include a direct clinical comparison of CollaGUARD&rsquo;s performance and
	safety compared to another CE-certified adhesion barrier. We do not believe that current European medical device regulations specifically
	require that our PMCF plan includes such a clinical comparison. In March 2016, we met with the Notified Body to seek clarification.
	At the meeting, T&Uuml;V S&Uuml;D agreed that current European medical device regulations do not specifically require that our
	PMCF plan includes such a clinical comparison, and agreed with our proposal for an updated PMCF based on the pilot clinical study
	in open myomectomy patients, as was agreed with FDA at the pre-IDE meeting. Provided T&Uuml;V S&Uuml;D determines that the clinical
	data from the U.S. pilot study are supportive, then recertification would be possible at that time based on an updated Technical
	Dossier and Clinical Evaluation. Until a new CE-certificate has been issued, we will not supply CollaGUARD to our marketing partners
	for sale in Europe or other affected territories. Accordingly, no such sales have been assumed in our financial forecasts.

	superior handling properties. Our proprietary processes and technologies also enable us to finely control the texture, consistency,

	the quality and cost of manufacturing, which will enable us to achieve higher operating margins. We have a fully integrated and
	reliable manufacturing process in Saal, beginning with the extraction and purification of the type-1 collagen (from bovine and
	equine Achilles tendons), which is further processed using one of our proprietary technologies to produce final finished products
	in the forms of matrices, films, powders, liquids, and gels. We have qualified multiple sources for bovine and equine tendons,
	and conduct a rigorous quality control process on the raw materials, locally at our Saal facility. These raw materials are readily
	available to us from multiple sources at stable pricing. Several of our products, including CollaGUARD, CollatampG, Septocoll and
	RegenePro, are marketed in countries around the world. Our proprietary technologies have been fully validated. Syntacoll was established
	in Germany in 1975 and has been manufacturing commercial products based on collagen technology since 1985. Our manufacturing staff
	is highly qualified and experienced due to Syntacoll&rsquo;s long history of producing collagen-based products. Our manufacturing
	facility has been approved in Germany for compliance with cGMPs. Our manufacturing facility is ISO 13485 certified in Europe and
	Canada. In our 30 years of producing collagen-based products, we have not experienced any significant quality issues or recalls.
	We believe we currently have adequate production capability to support our current production needs and planned clinical trials
	for XaraColl and Cogenzia. In addition, we expect to complete a capacity expansion build-out of our production facility to significantly
	increase capacity in the second half of 2016. Once completed and approved, we anticipate that our production capacity will be sufficient
	to meet currently forecasted market demand for all our current and late-stage pipeline product candidates.

	In March 2015, we submitted a petition to

	We anticipate that, if approved by the FDA
	for these indications, XaraColl would be used in conjunction with other pain medications, such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs as part
	of an advanced multi-modal approach. We believe that XaraColl will primarily be competing with Pacira Pharmaceutical&rsquo;s Exparel,
	a liposome injection of bupivacaine, an amide local anesthetic, indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to
	produce post-operative analgesia. Both Exparel and XaraColl are focused on opioid reduction or elimination as part of a multi-modal
	approach to pain relief. Management believes that XaraColl can provide at least comparable pain relief to Exparel with superior
	convenience. Exparel currently is only indicated for pain relief up to 24 hours post surgery. In addition, we believe our ability
	to manufacture XaraColl in a very cost-effective manner provides us with a cost of goods advantage over Exparel in the marketplace.
	In addition, XaraColl will be competing with currently marketed bupivacaine and opioid analgesics such as morphine, as well as
	elastomeric bag/catheter devices intended to provide bupivacaine over several days, which have been marketed by I-FLOW Corporation
	(now Halyard Health) since 2004.

	include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning and
	notice of violation letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production
	or distribution injunctions, unfavorable inspections, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil

	Before testing any compounds with potential
	therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical trial stage. Preclinical trials include laboratory evaluations
	of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal trials to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug
	candidate. The conduct of the preclinical trials must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor
	must submit the results of the preclinical trials, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical
	data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from
	the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational
	plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the
	FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day
	time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
	The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns,
	noncompliance with IND requirements, and other deficiencies. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result
	in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial.

	Clinical trials involve the administration

	not employed by or under the trial sponsor&rsquo;s control, in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research

	and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the
	protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent

	consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical
	trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial

	The FDCA permits the FDA and an IND sponsor
	to agree in writing on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in
	an NDA. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. We have an SPA in place for our Phase 3 registration trial
	for Cogenzia. An SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement
	of the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or
	effectiveness of the drug was identified after the trial began. For certain types of protocols, including carcinogenicity protocols,
	stability protocols, and Phase 3 protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim, the FDA has
	agreed under its performance goals associated with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, to provide a written response
	on most protocols within 45 days of receipt. However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goals, and additional FDA questions

	Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect
	the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing
	processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within
	required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance
	with cGCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities and other relevant
	information, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing
	of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications under specific conditions of use set out in the approved
	labeling. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not
	ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the
	FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s),
	and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical trials or manufacturing. If a
	Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in
	the letter or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the
	NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret
	data differently than we interpret the same data.

	If the FDA approves the NDA, the drug&rsquo;s
	approved labeling will be limited to specific diseases, dosages and indications and will include certain contraindications, warnings
	and/or precautions. The FDA may condition the approval of the NDA on changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate
	controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market trials or clinical trials. For example, the FDA
	may require post-approval studies which involve clinical trials designed to further assess a drug&rsquo;s safety and effectiveness
	and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The
	FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug.
	If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without
	an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician or patient communication plans, or other elements
	to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Following approval
	of an NDA with a REMS, the sponsor is responsible for marketing the drug in compliance with the REMS and must submit periodic REMS
	assessments to the FDA. Any of these limitations could restrict the commercial value of the product.

	The FDA has several overlapping programs that
	are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new
	drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition
	and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. In June 2015, Cogenzia received Qualified
	Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, designation for the adjunctive treatment of moderate and severe diabetic foot infection from
	the FDA. This designation is a key provision of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act, approved by Congress
	in 2012 to increase the incentives for drug manufacturers to produce new antibiotics for serious and hard-to-treat bacterial and
	fungal infections. QIDP designation for a drug adds an additional five years of market exclusivity, which means that the company
	that brings the drug into commercial use is protected from generic competitors for that period. For Cogenzia, that should result
	in eight years of data exclusivity in the United States, which would include three years of exclusivity for new clinical investigations
	that were essential for approval. QIDP designation also provides potential access to priority review of marketing applications
	and eligibility for fast track and priority review designations by the FDA. We expect to pursue a priority review designation for
	Cogenzia. A priority review designation means that the FDA&rsquo;s goal is to take action on an application within 6 months, compared
	to 10 months under standard review. However, QIDP Designation for Cogenzia does not guarantee priority review designation by the
	FDA.

	Any product submitted to the FDA for approval,
	including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development
	and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential
	to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment,
	diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the
	evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally,
	a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious
	or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect
	on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier
	than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality
	or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack
	of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving
	accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires
	as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial
	launch of the product.

	Unless an exemption applies, each medical device,

	or II, which, absent an exemption, requires the manufacturer to file with the FDA a 510(k) submission requesting permission for
	commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low-risk devices are exempt from this requirement. Devices
	deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or devices
	deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in class III, requiring approval of a PMA
	application. CollaGUARD is a Class III device requiring premarket approval. Both premarket clearance and PMA applications are subject
	to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution

	To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must file a
	510(k) submission demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a
	device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMA applications.
	The FDA&rsquo;s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is completed and filed,
	but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) submissions are cleared without clinical
	data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a 510(k) submission,
	the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After
	a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would
	constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could
	require de novo review or a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA
	can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&rsquo;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&rsquo;s
	determination that a new 510(k) submission is not required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the
	manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance, successful de novo review or approval
	of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance, de novo review or approval of a PMA application
	for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until
	we obtain FDA marketing authorization. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or
	penalties for failure to submit for marketing authorization.

	A PMA application must be submitted if the
	device is not exempt and cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process, which will be the case for CollaGUARD. The PMA application
	process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) premarket clearance process and requires proof of the safety
	and effectiveness of the device to the FDA&rsquo;s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application must be supported by extensive
	data including, but not limited to, technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trials,
	manufacturing data and labeling to support the FDA&rsquo;s determination that the device is safe and effective for its intended
	use. After a PMA application is deemed complete, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin an in-depth review of
	the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the &ldquo;accepted application,&rdquo; although, generally,
	review of the application takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the
	FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory
	panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the
	FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility
	to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires elaborate design development, testing, production control,
	documentation and other quality assurance procedures and measures upon the design, manufacturing and distribution process. The
	FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including,
	among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, collection of long-term follow-up data from patients
	in the clinical trial that supported approval, or new post-approval studies. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval
	can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. PMA supplements are required
	for modifications that could affect device safety or effectiveness, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the
	device&rsquo;s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the
	same type of information as an original PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support
	any changes to the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening
	of an advisory panel.

	A clinical trial is almost always required
	to support a PMA application and may be required for 510(k) premarket clearance. We expect that CollaGUARD, as a Class III device,
	will require a single pivotal trial for PMA approval. In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials
	intended to support product clearance or approval require an IDE application which the FDA reviews. Some types of trials deemed
	to present &ldquo;non-significant risk&rdquo; are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and IRB
	approval is obtained. If the device presents a &ldquo;significant risk&rdquo; to human health, as defined by FDA regulations, the
	sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE
	application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory trial results, showing that it is safe to evaluate
	the device in humans and that the trial protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the
	FDA for a specified number of subjects, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated
	IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the
	responsible institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result
	in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if,
	among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits
	of participation in the trial. During a trial, we are required to comply with the FDA&rsquo;s IDE requirements for investigator
	selection, trial monitoring, reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion or commercialization of investigational
	devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them, among other things. We are also responsible for the appropriate labeling
	and distribution of investigational devices. Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and federal
	and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including informed consent and healthcare privacy. The investigators
	must also obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and trial protocol, control the disposition
	of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements, among other things. The FDA&rsquo;s grant
	of permission to proceed with clinical trials does not constitute a binding commitment that the FDA will consider the trial design
	adequate to support commercial marketing clearance or approval. In addition, there can be no assurance that the data generated
	during a clinical trial will meet chosen safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA
	to grant marketing clearance or approval. Similarly, in Europe, the clinical trial must be approved by the local ethics committee
	and in some cases, including trials of high-risk devices, by the Ministry of Health in the applicable country.

	The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement
	with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for
	the manufacturer&rsquo;s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act made several
	changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers&rsquo; rebate liability by raising
	the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents from 15.1% of average manufacturer price
	(AMP) to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for &ldquo;line extensions&rdquo; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended
	release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by
	modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to
	drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010. Per a ruling
	by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012, states have the option to expand their Medicaid programs which in turn expands the population
	eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate
	liability to the territories of the United States as well. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides for the public availability
	of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by
	the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.

	In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to
	be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the
	340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts
	reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted
	340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&rsquo;s hospitals, these newly eligible
	entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In July 2013,
	the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) issued a final rule allowing the newly eligible entities to access discounted
	orphan drugs if used for non-orphan indications. While the final rule was vacated by a federal court ruling, HRSA has stated it
	will continue to allow discounts for orphan drugs when used for any indication other than for orphan indications. In addition,
	as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP
	definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.

	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory
	market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to any existing exclusivity period
	or patent term. This six-month exclusivity may be granted by FDA based on the completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with
	a &ldquo;Written Request&rdquo; for such as outlined in &sect;505A(d)(2) of the FDCA. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration
	Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA. FDASIA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application
	for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or
	new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, ideally within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting
	or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA but no later than 210 days before submission of the NDA or supplement. The initial
	PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and
	design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information,
	and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric
	studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments
	to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical
	studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.

	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics
	of the FDA approval of the use of our drug or device candidates, some of our U.S. patents or patents issuing based on our pending
	and future patent applications may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
	Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration
	term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process.
	However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&rsquo;s
	approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or IDE and
	the submission date of an NDA or PMA, respectively, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or PMA and the approval
	of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug or device is eligible for the extension and the application
	for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation
	with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to
	apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration
	date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.

	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA
	can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competing marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period
	of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical
	entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety,
	which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept
	for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based
	on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or
	for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval.
	However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement
	to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity
	for an NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted
	or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, clinical investigations
	to support new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification
	for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving
	ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity
	will not delay the submission or approval of any full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct
	or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical and clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
	An applicant submitting an ANDA would be required to demonstrate bioequivalency in patients comparing their candidate product to
	our product. Establishment of bioequivalency in patients can be a costly and challenging undertaking.

	The GAIN Act amended the FDCA in 2012 to increase
	the incentives for drug manufacturers to produce new antibiotics for treating serious and life-threatening bacterial and fungal
	infections. A qualifying product may be designated by FDA as a QIDP. QIDP designation for an antibiotic drug adds an additional
	five years of market exclusivity, in addition to the 5-year and 3-year periods discussed above. To obtain the benefit of additional
	exclusivity, a company must seek and obtain QIDP status before submitting its NDA to the FDA. QIDP designation also provides access
	to priority review of the NDA and eligibility for Fast Track designation by the FDA. In June 2015, Cogenzia received QIDP designation
	for the adjunctive treatment of moderate and severe diabetic foot infection from the FDA. This designation is a key provision of
	the GAIN Act approved by Congress in 2012 to increase the incentives for drug manufacturers to produce new antibiotics for serious
	and hard-to-treat bacterial and fungal infections. QIDP designation for a drug adds an additional five years of market exclusivity,
	which means that the company that brings the drug into commercial use is protected from generic competitors for that period. For
	Cogenzia, that should result in eight years of data exclusivity in the United States, which would include three years of exclusivity
	for new clinical investigations that were essential for approval. QIDP designation also provides potential access to priority review
	of marketing applications and eligibility for fast track and priority review designations by the FDA. We expect to pursue a priority
	review designation for Cogenzia. A priority review designation means that the FDA&rsquo;s goal is to take action on an application
	within 6 months, compared to 10 months under standard review. However, QIDP Designation for Cogenzia does not guarantee priority
	review designation by the FDA.

	has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member
	States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent
	authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the RMS. The competent
	authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of
	the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the CMS for their approval. If the CMS raise no objections, based on a potential
	serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently
	granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the CMS). If one or more CMS raise objections based on a potential
	serious risk to public health, the application is referred to the Coordination group for mutual recognition and decentralized procedure

	The advertising and promotion of our products
	in the EEA is subject to the provisions of the Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative
	advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other national legislation in the EEA countries
	governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. The European Commission has submitted a Proposal for a Regulation of
	the European Parliament and the Council on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation
	(EC) No 1223/2009, to replace, inter alia, Directive 93/42/EEC and to amend regulations regarding medical devices in the European
	Union, which could result in changes in the regulatory requirements for medical devices in Europe. In Germany, the advertising
	and promotion of our products can also be subject to restrictions provided by the German Act Against Unfair Competition (
<I>
	Gesetz
	gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb
</I>
	) and the law on the advertising of medicines (
<I>
	Heilmittelwerbegesetz
</I>
	), criminal law,
	and some codices of conduct with regard to medical products and medical devices among others. These laws may limit or restrict
	the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with
	healthcare professionals.

	In Ireland, the advertising and promotion
	of medicinal products to either healthcare professionals or the general public alike are governed by a combination of legislation
	including consumer protection laws, advertising of human medicinal product laws, competition and criminal laws and various codes
	of conduct, including in relation to advertising standards. The HPRA is the body responsible for monitoring the advertising of
	medicinal products and the enforcement of the relevant regulations.

	Sales of medical devices are subject to foreign
	government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products outside the United States,
	we must obtain regulatory approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations.
	The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country or to obtain a CE Certificate of Conformity may be longer or shorter
	than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. In the EEA, we are required to obtain Certificates
	of Conformity before drawing up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affixing the CE Mark of conformity to our medical devices.
	Any medical device being advertised in Ireland must have a CE mark and such advertisements must comply with the Advertising
	Standards Authority for Ireland&rsquo;s Code of Standards for Advertising, Promotional and Direct Marketing in Ireland. Many
	other countries, such as Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, accept CE Certificates of Conformity or FDA clearance
	or approval although others, such as Brazil, Canada and Japan require separate regulatory filings.

	Sales of our products will depend, in part,
	on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, statutory health
	insurances, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements
	for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued
	implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, competitive bidding program, restrictions on reimbursement and
	requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more
	restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases
	in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates
	could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations
	and financial condition.

	We may be subject to, or our marketing activities
	may be limited by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations,
	which established uniform standards for certain &ldquo;covered entities&rdquo; (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare
	clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of
	protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus
	package, included sweeping expansion of HIPAA&rsquo;s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for
	Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, the new law makes
	HIPAA&rsquo;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &ldquo;business associates,&rdquo; independent contractors
	or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf
	of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business
	associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions
	in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil
	actions.

	In Europe and Germany, we may be subject to
	strict data protection regulations, in particular with regard to health data of individuals, which are categorized as &ldquo;special
	categories of personal data&rdquo; pursuant to Section 3 subsection 9 German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz).
	&ldquo;Personal data&rdquo; refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject);
	an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number
	or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. The special categories
	of data such as health data may only be processed if the data subject consented to such processing or if (i) this is necessary
	in order to protect vital interests of the data subject or of a third-party, in so far as the data subject is unable to provide
	consent for physical or legal reasons; (ii) the data concerned have evidently been made public by the data subject; (iii) this
	is necessary in order to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that the data subject has an
	overriding legitimate interest in excluding such collection, processing or use; or (iv) this is necessary for the purposes of scientific
	research, where the scientific interest in carrying out the research project substantially outweighs the data subject&rsquo;s interest
	in excluding collection, processing and use and the purpose of the research cannot be achieved in any other way or would otherwise
	necessitate disproportionate effort. Therefore, we may be subject to and our marketing activities may be limited by the regulations
	regarding the data protection of individuals (e.g., according to the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
	of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of
	such data as well as to the German Federal Data Protection Act). These regulations could also restrict the transfer of data from
	Germany/Europe to the United States. The general transfer of personal data outside of Europe is prohibited according to Section
	4b subsection 2 sentence 2 German Federal Data Protection Act (implementing Art. 25 subsection 1 of the Directive 95/46/EC) if
	the data importer cannot guarantee an appropriate standard of data protection. A transfer of personal data to a non-EU member state
	(third country) is allowed only if the third country guarantees a reasonable standard of protection. Currently the United States
	is not regarded to be a country with an appropriate level of data protection meaning that further contractual arrangements have
	to be adopted to permit the international transfer of personal data to the United States. European data protection law is currently
	under review. A newly proposed European Data Protection Regulation is currently being negotiated by the European institutions.
	On March 12, 2014, the European Parliament voted for a new Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection
	of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation)
	which is expected to further strengthen the European data protection law.

	Our manufacturing facility is located on a
	site in Saal, Germany and consists of two production facilities, which occupy a total of approximately 30,000 square feet, and
	an office building of approximately 6,500 square feet. We have leased the facilities pursuant to lease agreement dated April 2009
	for a 10-year term, which is subject to additional five-year renewal options. Activities in this facility include the manufacture
	of all our products and product candidates and quality control testing, product storage, development of analytical methods, research
	and development, the coordination of clinical and regulatory functions, and general administrative functions. We have also
	leased space in Saal, Germany, including a workshop building, for a 15-year
	term, which is subject to additional five-year renewal options. This property will be used as an office, a laboratory, a warehouse,
	and for the production of pharmaceutical products and products under the German Medical Device Act. The monthly rent is &euro;15,494.50 plus the statutory Value Added Tax (&ldquo;V.A.T.&rdquo;) applicable from time to time. With the current V.A.T.
	of 19%, equaling &euro;2,943.96, the gross rent is &euro;18,438.46. We expect to complete a capacity expansion build-out
	of our production to approximately 50,000 square feet to expand its production capacity to support commercial production of XaraColl
	and Cogenzia, and the expanded facility is expected to be fully operational by the second half of 2016. Once completed and approved,
	we anticipate that our production capacity will be sufficient to meet currently forecasted market demand (including those marketed
	and sold through our partners) for all our current and late-stage pipeline product candidates. We believe that once our factory
	expansion program has been completed, our facility will be adequate to meet our current needs, and that suitable additional alternative
	spaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if required.

	We are a global, commercial
	stage, specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company, with late-stage development programs targeting areas of
	significant unmet medical need. We were incorporated in Delaware under the name Innocoll, Inc. in December 1997 and renamed
	Innocoll Holdings, Inc. in May 2004. Since 2004, our research and business development has been led and coordinated by our
	Irish subsidiaries. These Irish entities own our intellectual property and will be subject to Irish corporate tax on their
	future profits after the utilization of their tax losses. The applicable Irish corporate tax rate is 12.5%. In July 2013,
	we re-domiciled Innocoll Holdings, Inc. from the United States to Germany pursuant to a contribution-in-kind and share for
	share exchange into Innocoll GmbH, a German limited liability company, as a result of which Innocoll Holdings, Inc. became
	Innocoll GmbH&rsquo;s wholly-owned subsidiary. On July 3, 2014, Innocoll GmbH transformed into a German stock
	corporation, &ldquo;Innocoll AG.&rdquo; Innocoll AG was effectively managed and controlled from Ireland and had, therefore,
	become tax resident in Ireland under the terms of the Ireland-Germany double tax treaty with effect as of January 1, 2014. On
	March 16, 2016, Innocoll AG merged with Innocoll Holdings plc, a public limited company formed under Irish law, by way of a
	European cross-border merger with Innocoll Ireland being the surviving company. Prior to the merger Innocoll Holdings plc
	was a dormant company with minimal legally required share capital and related debtor on the statement of financial position. The
	Merger effectively resulted in Innocoll Ireland becoming the publicly-traded parent of the Innocoll group of
	companies carrying on the same business as that conducted by Innocoll Germany prior to the Merger. Accordingly, the
	consolidated information presented herein refers to Innocoll Holdings, Inc., as the &ldquo;company,&rdquo; and with its
	direct and indirect subsidiaries, collectively, as the &ldquo;group,&rdquo; for the period from January 1, 2012 until July
	24, 2013 and to Innocoll AG, as the &ldquo;company,&rdquo; and with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, collectively,
	as the &ldquo;group,&rdquo; for the period from July 25, 2013 until December 31, 2015. Except where indicated to the
	contrary, or the context suggests otherwise, all share and per share information: (i) not presented in the financial
	statements or financial statement data refers to ordinary shares of Innocoll Holdings plc, and (ii) included in the
	financial statements and financial statement data for Innocoll AG refers to ordinary shares of Innocoll Germany prior to the
	Merger. Innocoll Ireland, together with its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries as of the time relevant to the
	applicable reference, are collectively referred to as the Innocoll Group. Innocoll and its current direct and indirect wholly
	owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to as &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo;
	&ldquo;Innocoll&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company.&rdquo;

	As of December 31, 2015, we had four marketed
	products: (i) CollaGUARD, which utilizes our CollaFilm&reg; technology, a transparent, bioresorbable collagen film for the prevention
	of post-operative adhesions in multiple surgical applications, including digestive, colorectal, gynecological and urological surgeries;
	(ii) Collatamp Gentamicin Surgical Implant, or CollatampG, which utilizes our CollaRx&reg; sponge technology indicated for the
	treatment or prevention of post-operative infection; (iii) Septocoll&reg;, a bioresorbable, dual-action collagen sponge, indicated
	for the treatment or prevention of post-operative infection, which we manufacture and supply to Biomet Orthopedics Switzerland
	GmbH, or Biomet; and (iv)&nbsp;RegenePro, a bioresorbable collagen sponge for dental applications which we manufacture and supply
	to Biomet 3i.

	in all worldwide markets, excluding the United States. We have been supplying Septocoll to Biomet since 2001, for distribution
	to markets in Europe and the Middle East. CollaGUARD has been approved in 12 countries within Asia, Europe, Latin America and the
	Middle East. RegenePro was launched by Biomet 3i in the United States in July 2014.

	From 2004 to 2015, we incurred significant
	operating losses including a total of &euro;75.8 million spent on research and development in relation to our products and product
	candidates. Our operating losses were &euro;44.2 million, &euro;16.1 million, and &euro;6.9 million for the years ended December
	31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We do not expect that our currently marketed products alone will generate revenue that is
	sufficient for us to achieve profitability because we expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we advance the development
	of XaraColl, Cogenzia, CollaGUARD and our other product candidates, seek FDA and other regulatory approval for our product candidates
	that successfully complete clinical trials and develop our sales force and marketing capabilities to prepare for the commercial
	launch of our product candidates. We also expect to incur additional expenses expanding our operational, financial and management
	information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development efforts and our obligations as a public
	reporting company. For us to become and remain profitable, we believe that we must succeed in commercializing XaraColl, Cogenzia,
	CollaGUARD or other product candidates with significant market potential.

	In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014
	and 2013, our revenue was derived primarily from the supply of CollaGUARD, CollatampG and Septocoll, our products manufactured
	by us and sold by our commercial partners. Supply revenue is derived from a contractual supply price paid to us by our commercial
	partners. In the case of some of our distribution agreements, including for the sale of CollatampG, the supply price is a contractually
	agreed percentage of the net sales price received by our distribution partner, which is net of discounts, returns, and allowances
	incurred. In this case, revenue is recognized in two parts: the first amount is recognized for the manufacture and sale of the
	product at the point of sale, and the final amount is added or deducted when the product is sold by the distributor based upon
	the net sale price achieved.

	Clinical trial expenses for our product candidates
	are a significant component of our research and development expenses. Product candidates in late-stage clinical development, such

	primarily due to the increased size and duration of the clinical trials. We coordinate clinical trials through a number of contracted

	We incurred general and administrative expenses
	of &euro;19.0 million, &euro;11.7 million and &euro;4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
	General and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2015 included &euro;4.8 million in non-cash charges for stock-based
	compensation, compared to &euro;5.1 of such charges in the corresponding period in 2014. Excluding stock-based compensation, our
	general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were &euro;14.2 million, compared to &euro;6.6 million
	for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrate expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, was
	primarily due to our continued infrastructure build-out to support clinical programs, initiation of our pre-commercialization investment
	and expenses related to our re-domiciliation to Ireland. Additionally, we plan to build a larger commercial infrastructure for
	the anticipated future launches of XaraColl, Cogenzia and CollaGUARD, and we currently plan to hire our own sales force if Cogenzia
	is approved by the FDA.

	company to Germany in July 2013 (the &ldquo;Re-domicile of Parent Company,&rdquo; as described more fully in &ldquo;&mdash;Results
	of Operations&mdash;Financing Activities&rdquo;). For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had exceptionally high other income
	of &euro;16.1 million arising from the re-domicile of our parent company. In accordance with IAS 39, the liability associated with
	the series B convertible stock issued by Innocoll Holdings, Inc. was deemed to be extinguished as the new financial instruments
	issued had significantly different terms to the instruments they replaced. The difference between the fair value of the new financial
	instrument, and the carrying value of the extinguished series B convertible stock, was allocated against the carrying value of
	the liability and equity components with a resulting gain being recognized in profit and loss as noted above. Other income in the

	Other income in the year ended December 31, 2015 was &euro;0.0.

	Prior to the termination of Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s
	ADS facility, one ordinary share of Innocoll Germany represented 13.25 ADSs of Innocoll Germany. Upon consummation of the Merger,
	each ADS of Innocoll AG was exchanged for one ordinary share of Innocoll Holdings plc. Going forward, Innocoll Holdings plc&rsquo;s
	earnings/(loss) per share calculation will be equivalent to the earnings/(loss) per ADS calculation of Innocoll AG.

	loss per share for 2015 and 2014 the potentially exercisable instruments in issue would have the effect of being antidilutive and,

	The tables below include a reconciliation
	of our GAAP results to non-GAAP results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. We define adjusted non-GAAP
	earnings per share as basic and diluted earnings per share excluding share based payments, fair value expense on warrants and the reversal of impairment of property, plant and equipment. We believe adjusted non-GAAP earnings per
	share is meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial condition and results. We believe that non-GAAP earnings per share excluding these non-cash items may provide securities analysts, investors
	and other interested parties with a useful measure of our operating performance and cash requirements. Disclosure in this
	annual report of non-GAAP earnings per share, which is a non-IFRS financial measure, is intended as a supplemental measure of
	our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. Non-GAAP earnings per share should not be
	considered as an alternative to earnings per share, profit (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with
	IFRS. Our presentation of adjusted earnings per share of Innocoll
	Germany should not be construed to imply that our future results will be
	unaffected by unusual non-cash or non-recurring items.

	For the year ended December 31, 2015 the
	reconciliation primarily relates to non-cash expenses in the amount of &euro;4.8 million with respect to share-based
	compensation, &euro;3.7 million with respect to fair value expense on warrants and (&euro;3.9) million with respect to the
	reversal of impairment of property, plant and equipment. On a non-GAAP-basis, the net loss for the year ended December 31,
	2015 was &euro;38.5 million, or &euro;22.9 per share of Innocoll Germany ($1.88 per ADS of Innocoll Germany), compared to a
	net loss of &euro;9.3 million, or &euro;12.6 per share of Innocoll Germany ($1.03 per ADS of Innocoll Germany) for the year
	ended December 31, 2014. The number of ordinary shares of Innocoll Germany outstanding increased from 0.74 million during the
	year ended December 31, 2014, to 1.69 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the
	conversion of preferred shares into ordinary shares of Innocoll Germany, and the follow-on public offering in the
	second quarter of 2015.

	Pursuant to a notarial deed entered into on
	May 22, 2014, Innocoll GmbH granted to new and existing members of its supervisory board, management board and group employees
	a total of 43,596 restricted shares, 9,113 phantom shares and 869 unrestricted shares to a former member of our supervisory board
	(the &ldquo;May 2014 Grant&rdquo;). The total restricted shares and phantom shares issued pursuant to the May 2014 grant represented
	5.1% of the diluted share capital of Innocoll GmbH at the time of grant, excluding issued and outstanding options to acquire ordinary
	shares. Innocoll Germany further created an authorized capital of 2,060 ordinary shares as part of its Authorized Capital II with
	the intention to grant options to acquire ordinary shares to certain members of Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s advisory board, management
	board and employees which options were subsequently granted in December 2014 (see &ldquo;&mdash;Management Options&rdquo;). The
	restricted shares were issued in exchange for payment of nominal value of &euro;43,596. The phantom shares may be either settled
	in cash or a new issue of shares, at our option, on the date in which the repurchase right lapses. The May 2014 Grant occurred
	simultaneously with a new issue of series E preferred shares. The series E preferred shares were purchased in an arms-length
	transaction by existing investors, new supervisory board members who also received restricted stock grants, and three new investors
	who are partners of one of the existing shareholders. The pricing of the series E preferred shares at &euro;112.52&nbsp;per share
	was based upon our managing directors&rsquo; and our advisory board&rsquo;s estimate, with the assistance of a third-party specialist,
	who concluded that the price of Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADS in an anticipated initial public offering would be at least equal
	to such price or higher. To obtain the series E financing, it was necessary to give the investors anti-dilution rights in the
	event the initial public offering would be priced at a discount to the expected valuation. As a result of the initial public
	offering price of Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADS of $9.00 per ADS, and the anti-dilution rights granted to the series E preferred
	investors, such investors have been issued additional shares of Innocoll Germany at &euro;1.00 per share, as a result of which
	their weighted-average purchase price is equal to &euro;73.76 per share, a 16.7% discount to the effective value per ordinary
	share of Innocoll Germany in our initial public offering (see &ldquo;&mdash;Financing Events &mdash; Innocoll GmbH 2013 and 2014
	Equity Financings&rdquo;). There were no significant valuation events at the company between the May 2014 Grant date and date
	of our initial public offering in July 2014. Therefore, we have used the Series E preferred share adjusted weighted-average purchase
	price of &euro;73.76 per share as the value for the share-based payment charge arising out of the May&nbsp;2014 Grant. The share-based
	payments will be recognized over a one to three year period as set out above.

	Management, with the assistance of an independent
	third-party valuation consultant, relied upon the income approach to determine the range of fair market value of equity of our
	company. Because our value is attributable to our business operations, rather than the assets we hold, management, with the assistance
	of the independent third-party valuation consultant, did not rely upon the cost approach in its conclusion of the range of the
	fair market value of our equity. Management, with the assistance of the independent third-party valuation consultant, also did
	not believe that the multiples of established publicly-traded companies provided reliable indicators of value given that we are
	relatively early-stage; therefore, they considered, but ultimately did not rely on the GPC method. They also considered, but ultimately
	did not rely on the GMAC method due to the lack of comparable transactions. As a corroborative approach, they utilized the Back-Solve
	Method to estimate our implied equity value as derived from the Option-Pricing Method, based on the most recent round of financing
	of the series D preferred shares.

	In January 2014, we knew the initial public offering was a possibility but we were also considering other funding alternatives
	including the licensing of our products. As a independent third-party valuation was produced in connection with the re-domicile
	of our parent company in June 2013, updated to December 2013, it was determined that this valuation was a more reasonable estimate
	of the value than any potential initial public offering price which was far from certain and a potential liquidity event more distant.

	Given the global nature of the business and
	the multiple taxing jurisdictions in which the group operates, the determination of the group&rsquo;s provision for income taxes
	requires significant judgments and estimates, the ultimate tax outcome of which may not be certain. Although estimates are believed
	to be reasonable, the final outcome of these matters may be different than those reflected in the historical income tax provisions
	and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on the income tax provision and results in the period during which
	such determination is made.

	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
	using enacted tax rates for the effects of net operating losses and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets
	and liabilities. In assessing the reliability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that
	some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
	upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. While management
	considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment, there
	can be no assurance that these deferred tax assets may be realizable.

	The group evaluates the realizability of their

	The group writes off any inventory that is approaching its &ldquo;use-by&rdquo; date and for which no further re-processing can
	be performed. The group also considers recent trends in revenues for various inventory items and instances where the realizable
	value of inventory is likely to be less than its carrying value. Due to the fact that the allowance is calculated on the basis

	. Revenues for the year ended
	December 31, 2015 were 42.5% lower at &euro;2.6 million, compared to &euro;4.5 million for year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease
	was primarily due to a decrease in sales to Jazz Pharmaceuticals/EUSA Pharma of CollatampG, our gentamicin implant for the treatment
	and prevention of post-surgical infection, of &euro;1.3 million, or 37%, and a decrease in CollaGUARD sales of &euro;0.3 million,
	or 99%, primarily due to partners having purchased sufficient product in 2014 for 2015. CollaGUARD revenues in the year ended December
	31, 2015 were net of a &euro;0.0 million charge for free stock due to be shipped per the terms of our distribution partner agreements,
	leaving a CollaGUARD free stock credit outstanding of &euro;0.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Revenue from the sales of Septocoll
	decreased 42.5%, which was net of &euro;0.2 million of free stock shipped under an agreement with our distribution partner during
	the year ended December 31, 2013, leaving a Septocoll free stock credit outstanding of &euro;0.0 million as of December 31, 2015.

	Revenues
</I>
	. Revenues for the year ended
	December 31, 2014 were 26.8% higher at &euro;4.5 million, compared to &euro;3.5 million for year ended December 31, 2013. This
	increase was primarily due to an increase in sales by Jazz Pharmaceuticals of CollatampG, our gentamicin implant for the treatment
	and prevention of post-surgical infection, of &euro;0.7 million, or 26.2%, and an increase in CollaGUARD sales of &euro;0.2 million,
	or 131.1%, primarily due to the first shipment of our adhesion barrier CollaGUARD to our partner Takeda in connection with the
	product&rsquo;s launch in Russia in the third quarter of 2014. CollaGUARD revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014 were net
	of a &euro;0.1 million charge for free stock due to be shipped per the terms our distribution partner agreements, leaving a CollaGUARD
	free stock credit outstanding of &euro;0.1 million as of December 31, 2014. Revenue from the sales of Septocoll decreased 6.6%,
	which was net of &euro;0.1 million of free stock shipped under an agreement with our distribution partner during the year ended
	December 31, 2013, leaving a Septocoll free stock
	credit outstanding of &euro;0.2 million as of December 31, 2014. Biomet end user Septocoll sales based on volume of units shipped
	decreased by 20% in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, during the third
	quarter of 2014 Biomet 3i launched RegenePro, our product to treat dental wounds in the United States, generating sales of &euro;0.1
	million in the year ended December 31, 2014.

	Cost of sales of &euro;5.6

	ended December 31, 2013. Gross margins from supply revenue were (24)% and (28)% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013,
	respectively. All overhead costs associated with operating our manufacturing facility are included in the standard cost of our
	products as indirect costs and charged to cost of sales based on sales volume. Excluding such indirect costs, gross margins for
	each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were positive (as more fully decribed in &ldquo;&mdash;Cost of Sales&rdquo;

	Research and Development Expenses

	. R&amp;D
	expenses were &euro;3.3 million for the year ended December 2014 as compared to &euro;1.7 million for the year ended December 31,
	2013, a 95.6% increase. R&amp;D expenses in each year consisted of external clinical research costs as well as costs of internal
	research and development personnel and internal laboratory costs at our Saal, Germany facility. In the year ended December 31,
	2014, external clinical research costs were &euro;1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to &euro;0.1 million
	external clinical research costs in the year ended December 31, 2013, the increase was primarily due to the commencement of our
	pivotal pharmacokinetics and safety study of XaraColl in the third quarter of 2014. From January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2014,
	we incurred research and development expenses of &euro;48.9 million net of contributions and collaboration agreements with third
	parties. We incurred below-average research and development expenses in each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and December
	31, 2013 due to the fact that substantially all of our Phase 2 clinical trials were completed prior to 2012 and we did not commence
	Phase 3 trials until the third quarter of 2014.

	charges for stock-based compensation, compared to &euro;0.0 of such charges in the corresponding period in 2013. Stock-based compensation
	expense in the year ended ended December, 31, 2014 was exceptionally high due to the timing of share grants and vesting linked
	to the completion of our initial public offering in the third quarter 2014. Excluding such charges for stock-based compensation,
	G&amp;A expenses were &euro;6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to &euro;4.1 million for the year ended
	December 31, 2013. The increase in G&amp;A excluding stock-based compensation was primarily due to accounting, legal and consulting
	professional fees, insurance costs and investor relations costs related to becoming a public company.

	Since 2004, we have devoted a substantial
	portion of our cash resources to research and development and general and administrative activities primarily related to the development
	of our products, including XaraColl, Cogenzia and CollaGUARD. We have financed our operations primarily with the proceeds of the
	sale of preferred shares and convertible notes, supply revenue and collaborative licensing and development revenue, our initial
	public offering and April 2015 follow-on public offering. Over the course of 2016, we expect to generate revenues
	from the licensing and sale of CollaGUARD pursuant to our license agreements with Takeda and others, and other product licensing
	agreements. We expect to generate revenues from the sale of XaraColl and Cogenzia by the end of 2017. We have incurred losses
	and generated negative cash flows from operations since 2004. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of &euro;149.9
	million and cash and cash equivalents of &euro;38.7 million. As at December 31, 2015 Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Ltd. had Irish tax
	losses of &euro;101 million which can be carried forward to shelter future Irish trading profits indefinitely. There is no limitation
	on the use of losses in any particular year (i.e. no minimum tax payment rule). Irish law imposes certain limitations on the application
	of net operating loss carryforwards and no assurance can be given that these tax losses will be available to the full extent in

	In January 2014, Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s predecessor, Innocoll GmbH, entered into an option
	agreement, as amended on March 20, 2014 with its then-existing shareholders, including certain officers, directors
	and affiliates in their capacity as shareholders. The option agreement covers all options issued by Innocoll GmbH in
	connection with its re-domicile and the 2013 equity financing described above under &ldquo;&mdash;Re-Domicile of Parent
	Company,&rdquo; and &ldquo;&mdash;Innocoll GmbH 2013 and 2014 Equity Financings,&rdquo; respectively. Pursuant to the 2014
	Option Agreement, these shareholders and Kinabalu Financial Products L.L.P. received the right, at any time and from time to
	time, to purchase up to an aggregate of 205,199 shares of Innocoll GmbH in the aggregate, with an exercise price
	of&thinsp; &euro;100 per share (subject to adjustment) and a contractual life of 10 years. In connection with Innocoll
	Germany&rsquo;s transformation into a stock corporation, all options under the original 2014 option agreement were cancelled
	and replaced by a new option agreement on substantially similar terms pursuant to which beneficiaries were entitled to
	purchase up to 205,199 ordinary shares of Innocoll AG in the aggregate at the same initial exercise price of&thinsp;
	&euro;100 per share (as so replaced, the &ldquo;2014 Option Agreement&rdquo;), which obligations have been assumed by
	Innocoll Ireland. The 2014 Option Agreement provides that if we issue or sell or are deemed to have issued or sold any of our
	ordinary shares without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the exercise price in effect immediately
	prior to the time of such issue or sale, the exercise price is reduced to a price equal to the price per share at which such
	shares are issued or sold or deemed issued or sold, subject to certain limited exceptions for share option, share purchase or
	similar plan or arrangement for the benefit of our or our subsidiaries&rsquo; employees, officers, consultants or directors,
	pre-existing options, securities issued as consideration for any acquisition by the us or our subsidiaries, or securities
	issued to banks, equipment lessors or other financial institutions, or to real property lessors, pursuant to a debt
	financing, equipment leasing or real property leasing transaction which is approved by the management board. As a result of
	the $9.00 per ADSs price of Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s initial public offering, the exercise price was adjusted to &euro;88.52
	per ordinary share of Innocoll Germany, which price is subject to further adjustment if we issue securities at an equivalent
	value below this price, or $7.42 per ordinary share of Innocoll Ireland (based on conversion to U.S. dollars at an exchange
	rate of&thinsp; $1.1109 per euro, the official exchange rate quoted as of March 15, 2016 by the European Central Bank)
	through June 15, 2019, on which date any unexercised options expire pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Option Agreement,

	Innocoll GmbH transformed into a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft or AG) in accordance with the provisions of the German
	Reorganization Act (Umwandlungsgesetz). In connection therewith, all 1,004,523 outstanding ordinary shares of Innocoll GmbH became
	1,004,523 ordinary shares of Innocoll AG. Accordingly, although we changed our legal form, there was no change in our identity.
	The following table summarizes the capitalization of Innocoll GmbH before, and giving effect to, its recapitalization and the conversion
	of all preferred shares into ordinary shares prior to its transformation into Innocoll AG:

	our outstanding ordinary shares at the time of grant, and entered into a related restricted share award agreement
	with Mr.&nbsp;Zook. Pursuant to the award agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Zook is required to subscribe to the restricted ordinary shares
	of Innocoll Germany
	at their nominal value per share of EUR 1.00 each. The restricted ordinary shares of Innocoll Germany
	are subject to our repurchase right
	if Mr.&nbsp;Zook&rsquo;s employment with us terminates for any reason other than in connection with a change of control,
	which repurchase right lapses for 33.3% of the restricted ordinary shares upon the first anniversary of the grant date
	and thereafter, for an additional 8.3325% of the restricted ordinary shares on a quarterly basis. If
	Mr.&nbsp;Zook&rsquo;s employment with us terminates within 180 days before or after the occurrence of a change of control,
	our repurchase right lapses for all the restricted ordinary shares. The award agreement further provides that Mr.&nbsp;Zook
	may not assign, pledge or otherwise transfer the restricted ordinary shares until the earlier of the fourth anniversary of
	the date of the award agreement and a change of control.

	The committee is authorized to grant SARs and
	stock options (including ISOs except that an ISO may only be granted to an employee of ours or one of our subsidiary corporations).
	A stock option allows a grantee to purchase a specified number of our ordinary shares at a predetermined price per share (the &ldquo;exercise
	price&rdquo;) during a fixed period measured from the date of grant. An SAR entitles the grantee to receive the excess of the fair
	market value of a specified number of shares on the date of exercise over a predetermined exercise price per share. The exercise
	price of an option or an SAR will be determined by the committee and set forth in the award agreement but the exercise price may
	not be less than the fair market value of an ordinary share on the grant date. The term of each option or SAR is determined by
	the committee and set forth in the award agreement, except that the term may not exceed 10 years. Options may be exercised by payment
	of the purchase price through one or more of the following means: payment in cash (including personal check or wire transfer),
	or, with the approval of the committee, by delivering ordinary shares previously owned by the grantee, by delivery of ordinary
	shares acquired upon the exercise of such option or by delivering restricted shares. The committee may also permit a grantee to
	pay the exercise price of an option through the sale of shares acquired upon exercise of the option through a broker-dealer to
	whom the grantee has delivered irrevocable instructions to deliver sales proceeds sufficient to pay the purchase price to us.

	A participant may elect under Section 83(b) of
	the Code to be taxed at the time of grant of restricted stock or other restricted property on the fair market value of the ordinary
	shares or other property at that time rather than to be taxed when the risk of forfeiture lapses on the value of the property at
	that time, and we would have a deduction available at the same time and in the same amount as the participant recognizes income.
	If a participant files an election under Section 83(b) of the Code and the participant subsequently forfeits the restricted shares
	or other restricted property, he or she would not be entitled to any tax deduction, including as a capital loss, for the value
	of the ordinary shares or property on which he or she previously paid tax. Except as discussed below, we generally will be entitled
	to a tax deduction at the time and equal to the amount recognized as ordinary income by the participant in connection with an option,
	stock appreciation right, or other award, but will be entitled to no tax deduction relating to amounts that represent a capital
	gain to a participant. Thus, we will not be entitled to any tax deduction with respect to an incentive stock option if the participant
	holds the shares for the incentive stock option holding periods.

	Section 162(m) of the Code limits the amount

	officers (other than a chief financial officer) to $1 million per year. This deduction limit generally applies to companies that
	have any class of equity securities that is publicly held. This limitation does not apply, however, to performance-based compensation
	that satisfies certain requirements, including approval of the material terms of the plan by the company&rsquo;s shareholders.
	In addition, the deduction limitations imposed under Section 162(m) of the Code do not apply to options, SARs and restricted shares
	granted prior to the expiration of the transition period (as described below) if such equity awards are granted under a plan that

	In January 2014 (as amended on March 20, 2014), Innocoll Germany
	adopted a restricted share plan pursuant to which certain restricted shares of Innocoll Germany
	have been issued to members of our management board
	and certain of our employees and employees of our subsidiaries, which restricted shares were converted into Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s
	ordinary shares
	or rights to receive Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s
	ordinary shares or cash in the course of our transformation into a stock corporation. Pursuant to the
	restricted share plan and the award agreements entered into in connection therewith, the restricted shares are forfeited and subject
	to a repurchase right by us in the case of a bad leaver event, which is (i) a voluntary termination by the employee, other than
	in the context of a constructive termination, and (ii) a termination of the grantee by us for cause. If a bad leaver event occurs,
	the restricted shares and phantom shares can be repurchased by us at any time without further notice or action of the grantee at
	a price equal to the lesser of the amount paid by the grantee for such shares, and the fair market value per share on the date of such forfeiture. However, if no bad leaver event occurs before the occurrence
	of the earlier of (i), in the case of members of our management board and certain members of our advisory board, (a) the 183rd
	day after our initial public offering, and (b) a so-called liquidity event, or (ii) in the case of certain members of our advisory
	board, (a) upon a so called liquidity event or (b) in the case of an initial public offering, in relation to 33.3% and 66.7% and
	100% of the shares subject to the grant, on the date which is one, two and three years after the grant date respectively, or in
	each case the 183rd day after the completion of an initial public offering, whichever is later, our repurchase right terminates
	and the ordinary shares or phantom shares held by the grantee are no longer subject to any restrictions. A liquidity event occurs
	in the event we merge or consolidate into or with another entity or vice versa (subject to certain limited exceptions), of the
	sale, conveyance, mortgage, pledge or lease of all or substantially all our assets, or of the disposition of securities representing
	a majority of our voting power through a transaction or series of related transactions. For certain of the grantees holding restricted
	shares, their award agreement specifies that our repurchase right also terminates on the day prior to date that is the fifth anniversary
	of the date the restricted shares were granted to such person, if earlier than the other termination events described above. While
	the restricted shares are still subject to our repurchase right, they may not be transferred by the grantee other than by way of
	inheritance or for estate planning purposes. The January 2014 restricted share plan and the award agreements granted thereunder
	as well as the phantom share award agreements were terminated with effect as of the effective date of our transformation into Innocoll
	AG and were replaced by substantially similar award agreements.

	Innocoll Germany
	also entered into certain phantom share
	award agreements with certain of our executives who did not receive restricted shares under the restricted share plan, which phantom
	share award agreements were subsequently amended and restated following our initial public offering. Pursuant to the amended and
	restated phantom share award agreement entered into in January 2015, the grantee has a contractual claim against us to receive
	a bonus payment in case of a so-called exit event, which is the earlier of (i) the occurrence of a liquidity event, as described
	above for the restricted share plan and (ii) any trading day of our securities on Nasdaq within the period beginning on the third trading
	day after the publication of our quarterly reports for the fourth quarter of 2014 and ending on the trading day immediately preceding
	the first trading day that is two weeks prior to the end of the first quarter of 2015, which has been designated by our management
	board in its free discretion. The bonus payment will be an amount equal to the fictitious value of the phantom shares held by the
	grantee to be calculated on the basis of the value of our company on a cash free/debt free basis at the time and as a result of
	an exit event, divided by the real number of shares of our company issued at the time of the exit event, in each case treating
	phantom shares as if they were actual restricted shares. We have the option, but not the obligation, to issue restricted shares
	to the grantee in lieu of a cash bonus payment. The phantom shares are subject to our repurchase right if a bad leaver event occurs
	under the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the restricted shares, described above. While the restricted shares
	or the phantom shares are still subject to our repurchase right, they may not be transferred by the grantee other than by way of

	that our management board is concerned, our supervisory board, selects the eligible persons to whom options will be granted

	members are independent directors in accordance with the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market except for Anthony P.
	Zook, our Chief Executive Officer. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, including that the
	board member is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the board member nor any
	of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, as required by NASDAQ rules, our
	board has made a subjective determination as to each independent director that no relationships exist, which, in the opinion of
	our board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a board member. In
	making these determinations, our board reviewed and discussed information provided by the members of the board and us with regard
	to each board member&rsquo;s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. There
	are no family relationships among any of the members of our board or our executive officers. In addition, all members of the audit
	committee meet the independence requirements contemplated by Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0 0 12PT; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25IN">
	On April 30, 2015,
	Innocoll Germany sold 1,999,690 ADSs of Innocoll Germany to the public in an underwritten offering, representing 150,920
	ordinary shares of Innocoll Germany, at a price of&thinsp; $9.00 per ADS, thereby raising $16.9 million after deducting
	underwriting discounts and commissions. In the same offering certain selling shareholders offered 1,321,979 ADSs of Innocoll Germany,
	representing 99,772 ordinary shares of Innocoll Germany. We received no proceeds from the shares sold by the selling
	shareholders. In the same offering, one of our existing shareholders and certain members of Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s management and
	supervisory boards purchased an aggregate of&thinsp; $3.8 million of Innocoll Germany ADSs at the public offering price of
	$9.00 per ADS, consisting of an aggregate of 420,000 of the 3,321,669 ADSs then sold. Upon the effectiveness of the Merger,
	we terminated Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADS facility and each cancelled ADS effectively became an entitlement to receive one
	ordinary share of Innocoll Ireland.

	Historically, Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADSs
	represented 1/13.25 of one ordinary share of Innocoll AG. Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ Global Market
	from July 25, 2014 to March 15, 2016. Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, we terminated Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADS facility,
	each cancelled ADS was effectively exchanged for one ordinary share of Innocoll Ireland and holders of Innocoll Germany
	ordinary shares received 13.25 ordinary shares of Innocoll Ireland in exchange for each share held of Innocoll Germany.
	Simultaneous with this transaction, Innocoll Ireland listed its ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol
	&ldquo;INNL&rdquo;, which we previously used for Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s ADS. Our ordinary shares, par value $0.01 per share,
	have been listed on the NASDAQ Global Market since March 16, 2016.

	On March 16, 2016, Innocoll AG merged with Innocoll Holdings
	plc by way of a European cross-border merger with Innocoll Holdings plc being the surviving company. Upon the effectiveness
	of the Merger, we terminated Innocoll AG ADS facility and each cancelled ADS effectively became an entitlement to receive one
	ordinary share of Innocoll Holdings plc. Holders of Innocoll AG ordinary shares received 13.25 ordinary shares of Innocoll
	Holdings plc in respect of each share held of Innocoll AG. Simultaneous with this transaction, Innocoll Holdings plc listed
	its ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol &ldquo;INNL&rdquo;, which we previously used for Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s
	ADSs. The
	Merger effectively resulted in Innocoll Holdings plc becoming the publicly-traded parent of the Innocoll group of companies
	carrying on the same business as that conducted by Innocoll AG prior to the Merger.

	Nine shareholders of record as of January
	23, 2016, collectively holding 176 ordinary shares of Innocoll Germany as of March 15, 2016, have recorded their objection to
	the Merger in the minutes of Innocoll Germany&rsquo;s extraordinary general meeting, held on January 30, 2016. As a result, the objecting
	shareholders are entitled to accept the cash offer to acquire the ordinary shares held by them, as set forth in the Merger Proposal,
	which offer has not yet been accepted. Following the Merger, and the receipt of 13.25 ordinary shares of Innocoll Ireland for
	each previously outstanding ordinary share of Innocoll Germany, Innocoll Ireland would be required to acquire the 2,330 ordinary
	shares of Innocoll Ireland now held by the objecting shareholders for cash, provided such offer is accepted by the objecting shareholders

	CAT is currently levied at a rate of 33% above

	donee and (2) the aggregation of the values of previous gifts and inheritances received by the donee from persons within the same
	group threshold. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Shareholders should consult their own tax

	the gross amount of any distribution that is actually or constructively received (as described below, including any Irish withholding

	for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of Innocoll Ireland&rsquo;s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as
	determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). To the extent that the amount of such distribution exceeds Innocoll Ireland&rsquo;s

	we do not compute our earnings and profits under U.S. tax principles, however, we expect to report the full amount of any distribution
	as a dividend for U.S. tax purposes if and when we pay a dividend to our shareholders. With respect to non-corporate U.S. holders,
	certain dividends received from a qualified foreign corporation will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a maximum rate of
	20%. As long as Innocoll Ireland ordinary shares are listed on NASDAQ or certain other exchanges and/or Innocoll Ireland qualifies
	for benefits under the income tax treaty between the United States and Ireland or another applicable income tax treaty, Innocoll
	Ireland will be treated as a qualified foreign corporation for this purpose. This reduced rate will not be available in all situations,
	and U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the relevant rules to their particular circumstances.
	If Innocoll Ireland is a PFIC as&nbsp;discussed below under &ldquo;&mdash; PFIC Rules,&rdquo; distributions paid by Innocoll Ireland

	You must include any Irish tax withheld from
	the dividend payment in this gross amount even though you do not in fact receive it. The gross amount of the dividend is taxable
	to you when you receive the dividend, actually or constructively. Dividends paid on Innocoll Ireland ordinary shares generally
	will constitute income from sources outside the United States and will generally not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction
	generally available to corporate U.S. holders. Because we expect to pay any future dividends in a non-U.S. currency, the gross
	amount of any such dividend will be included in the gross income of a U.S. holder in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of
	the non-U.S. currency calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend distribution is includable
	in the U.S. holder&rsquo;s income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. If the non-U.S. currency
	is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt by the U.S. holder, a U.S. holder generally should not be required to recognize
	non-U.S. currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend. If the non-U.S. currency received is not converted into U.S. dollars
	on the date of receipt, a U.S. holder will have a basis in the non-U.S. currency equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date of
	receipt. Any gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the non-U.S. currency will be treated as ordinary
	income or loss, and will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.
	The amount of any distribution of property other than cash will be the fair market value of the property on the date of the distribution,
	less the sum of any encumbrance assumed by the U.S. holder.

	Subject to applicable limitations that may vary
	depending upon a U.S. holder&rsquo;s circumstances, a U.S. holder will be entitled to a credit against its U.S. federal income
	tax liability for any Irish withholding taxes withheld in respect of our dividend distributions not in excess of the applicable
	rate under the income tax treaty between the United States and Ireland. For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends
	paid on Innocoll Ireland ordinary shares generally will be treated as income from sources outside the United States, except that
	a portion of such dividends may be treated as income from U.S. sources. In addition, the limitation on foreign taxes eligible for
	credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income, such as &ldquo;passive&rdquo; or &ldquo;general&rdquo;
	income. In addition, the amount of the qualified dividend income, if any, paid to a U.S. holder that is subject to the reduced
	dividend income tax rate and that is taken into account for purposes of calculating the U.S. holder&rsquo;s U.S. foreign tax credit
	limitation must be reduced by the rate differential portion of the dividend. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex.
	Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular situation.
	In lieu of claiming a foreign tax credit, U.S. holders may elect to deduct all non-U.S. taxes paid or accrued in a taxable year
	in computing their taxable income, subject to generally applicable limitations under U.S. federal income tax law.

	Passive income generally includes dividends,

	treated as passive income for such purpose. If a non-U.S. corporation owns at least 25% by value of the shares of another corporation,
	the non-U.S. corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the other
	corporation, and as receiving directly its proportionate share of the other corporation&rsquo;s income. We believe that Innocoll

	year in which the Merger occurred. In addition, we believe that Innocoll Ireland should not be treated as a PFIC immediately after
	the Merger. However, the tests for determining PFIC status are applied annually, and it is difficult to accurately predict future
	income and assets relevant to this determination. Accordingly, we cannot assure U.S. holders that Innocoll Germany and Innocoll
	Ireland will not be or become a PFIC. Moreover, the determination of PFIC status depends, in part, on the application of complex
	U.S. federal income tax rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. As a result, whether Innocoll Germany or Innocoll
	Ireland is or will be a PFIC for any relevant taxable year cannot be predicted with certainty, and there can be no assurance that
	the IRS will not challenge our determination concerning our PFIC status.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0; TEXT-INDENT: 20PT">
	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation
	generally is considered a domestic corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes (a &ldquo;
<B>
	U.S. corporation
</B>
	&rdquo;) if it is
	created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any state thereof or the District of Columbia.
	Entities treated as U.S. corporations are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on their worldwide income, and U.S. reporting
	and withholding tax rules may apply to dividends that they pay. Because Innocoll Germany was formed and organized under the law
	of Germany, Innocoll Germany would ordinarily not be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a U.S. corporation. Section
	7874 of the Code, however, contains special rules that could result in a non-U.S. corporation being taxed as a U.S. corporation
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes where the corporation, directly or indirectly, re-domiciles from the U.S. to another country.
	Under Section 7874 of the Code, as a result of the re-domiciling from the U.S. to Germany in 2013 (the &ldquo;
<B>
	2013 Transaction
</B>
	&rdquo;),
	we would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless our &ldquo;expanded affiliated group&rdquo;
	(&ldquo;
<B>
	EAG
</B>
	&rdquo;) is treated as having &ldquo;substantial business activities&rdquo; in Germany. While we believe that
	we satisfied this &ldquo;substantial business activities&rdquo; test at the time of the 2013 Transaction (and, thus, should not
	be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes), due to the complexity of certain aspects of the law and
	the very fact-specific nature of the inquiry, there is no assurance that the IRS will not challenge our determination. Further,
	the IRS has issued recent guidance in Notice 2015-79 that provides that an EAG cannot meet the substantial business activities
	test with respect to a foreign country unless the foreign acquiring corporation is a tax resident of that foreign country. This
	new requirement for the substantial business activities test is effective for acquisitions completed on or after November&nbsp;19,
	2015. However, Notice 2015-79 also states that no inference is intended regarding the treatment under current law of any transaction
	described in Notice 2015-79 and that the IRS may challenge such transactions under applicable Code sections or judicial doctrines.
	In addition, there have been proposals to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence and there could be prospective or retroactive
	legislative changes to Section 7874 of the Code that would result in Innocoll Germany and/or Innocoll Ireland being treated as
	a U.S. corporation.

	In addition to the issues discussed above regarding
	the 2013 Transaction, we have re-domiciled in 2016 to Ireland. If the Merger is treated as a related transaction to the 2013 Transaction,
	then Innocoll Germany and/or Innocoll Ireland would be treated as a U.S. corporation as of the 2013 Transaction unless our EAG
	is treated as having substantial business activities in Ireland. In that case, we would not satisfy the substantial business activities
	test in Ireland, and thus, we would be treated as a U.S. corporation, even if we would have met the substantial business activities
	test had we remained a German corporation. Due to the complexity of certain aspects of the law and the very fact-specific nature
	of the inquiry, there is no assurance that the IRS will not successfully challenge our position that we are a non-U.S. corporation.
	If Innocoll Germany and/or Innocoll Ireland are treated as U.S. corporations, Innocoll Germany and Innocoll Ireland would be liable
	for U.S. federal income taxes in addition to German and Irish taxes. In addition, our non-U.S. holders would be subject to U.S.
	withholding tax (including under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, as defined below) on the receipt of dividends from Innocoll
	Ireland.

	to the Merger, and Innocoll Ireland, after the Merger, and such subsidiaries would be &ldquo;controlled foreign corporations&rdquo;.
	See&nbsp;the discussion above in &ldquo;&mdash; Controlled Foreign Corporation Rules&rdquo; that could apply to Innocoll Germany
	or Innocoll Ireland. Regardless of whether Innocoll Germany or Innocoll Ireland is treated as a U.S. corporation, it is expected
	that it will continue to be treated as an Irish tax resident for Irish and German tax purposes, and therefore it could be liable
	for both Ireland and U.S. taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
	In addition, any loans made to Innocoll Germany or Innocoll Ireland by a non-U.S. subsidiary corporation of Innocoll Germany or
	Innocoll Ireland, could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences. Further, any determination by the IRS or a U.S.
	court that we are a U.S. corporation would apply retroactively, and so we could face substantial U.S. federal income tax, interest,
	and penalties for taxable years prior to such determination.

	If Innocoll Ireland is treated as a U.S. corporation,
	then U.S. holders, among other tax consequences, would not be eligible to obtain a U.S. foreign tax credit with respect to any
	Irish tax withheld from any dividend distributions. This is because dividend distributions from U.S. corporations are treated as
	U.S. source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and therefore such Irish withholding taxes will likely not be creditable
	for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Thus, to the extent a U.S. holder receives dividend distributions, such holder could be liable
	for both Irish and U.S. taxes on the receipt of such dividends without the ability to take a foreign tax credit for the Irish taxes.
	The interaction of Section 7874 of the Code to certain other U.S. federal income tax provisions is not yet well defined under U.S.
	federal income tax law. This summary does not discuss all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that could affect a U.S.
	holder if Innocoll Ireland is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each U.S. holder is urged to
	contact its own tax advisor regarding U.S. federal income tax consequences if Innocoll Ireland is treated as a U.S. corporation.

	We are subject to currency risk, as our income

	U.S. dollar and the euro. We aim to match foreign currency cash inflows with foreign cash outflows where possible. We do not hedge
	this exposure. A 10% movement in the U.S. dollar versus euro exchange rate at December 31, 2015 would have the effect of increasing/decreasing
	net liabilities by approximately &euro;1.5 million. As we incur clinical trial expenses in the United States in U.S. dollars, raise
	funds through licensing and collaboration revenue in U.S. dollars and commence sales of our products in the United States, we expect
	to have significant increases in cash balances, revenues and research and development costs denominated in U.S. dollars, while
	the majority of our cost of sales and operating costs are expected to remain denominated in euro. Accordingly, our exposure to
	exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro has increased significantly commencing in 2014 compared to 2013. Between January
	2013 and December 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro ranged between $1.3953 per euro and $1.0552 per
	euro.

	taxes that may be applicable to the termination and the transfer of shares in respect of the termination. In accordance with the

	underwriting discounts and commissions. On August 20, 2014, the underwriters in our initial public offering partially exercised
	their overallotment option to purchase an additional 186,984&nbsp;ADSs, representing 14,112 Ordinary Shares, at a public offering

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of

	reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform
	an audit of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
	over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
	purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
	we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
	in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
	evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	with the shipping terms. Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that economic benefit will flow to the group,

	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted

	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
	or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
	generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. While management

	model. The use of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation
	expense and include the expected life of the option, stock price, volatility, risk-free interest rate and exercise price.

	Due to the nature of the group&rsquo;s current activities,
	the managing directors consider there to be one operating segment, the manufacture and sale of collagen-based pharmaceutical products.
	The entire group&rsquo;s revenue is derived from this operating segment which can be spread among five geographical regions. The
	group principally sells four products; CollatampG globally outside of the United States, Septocoll within Europe and the Middle
	East, CollaGUARD within Europe, the Middle East and Asia and RegenePro in the United States. The results of the group are reported
	on a consolidated basis to the chief operating decision maker of the group, the chief executive officer. There are no reconciling
	items between the group&rsquo;s reported income statement and statement of financial position and the results and financial position,
	respectively, of the above segment.

	The majority of the product revenue, &euro;2.6 million,
	relates to sales of CollatampG and Septocoll and is split between two customers; in 2015 the split was 88% and 12%. The group
	receives a contractually agreed percentage of the net in-market sales of CollatampG from one of its customers which distributes
	the product. This is recognized in two parts; the first amount is recognized for the manufacture and sale of product at the point
	of sale; and the final amount when the product is sold.

	of Septocoll customers, &euro;1.1 million in respect of CollaGUARD and the remaining &euro;0.4 million mainly relating to its

	In 2013 and in accordance with IAS 39, the liability associated
	with the series B convertible stock issued by Innocoll Holdings, Inc. was deemed to be extinguished as the new financial instruments
	issued had significantly different terms to the instruments they replaced. The difference between the fair value of the new financial
	instrument, and the carrying value of the extinguished series B convertible stock, was allocated against the carrying value of
	the liability and equity components with a resulting gain being recognized in profit and loss as noted above.

	In 2011 and 2012, the group impaired property, plant
	and equipment relating to their manufacturing facility in Saal, Germany by &euro;4.8 million. The group recommenced their
	facility expansion during 2015. As the initial conditions reversed from when the initial decision was taken to impair the
	property, plant and equipment, the impairment was reversed. The value of the property, plant and equipment was assessed
	against current market values and the reversal of the impairment was recorded to the extent that each asset&rsquo;s carrying
	amount did not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised.

	Owing to the nature of the re-domicile, there was no change
	in the substance of the reporting entity and therefore, a business combination, in accordance with IFRS 3, was not deemed to have
	occurred. IFRS 3 does not apply to a business combination involving entities or businesses under common control. The introduction
	therefore of Innocoll AG (formerly known as Innocoll GmbH) as a new holding company for the group was accounted for as a continuation
	of the business previously carried out by Innocoll Holdings, Inc. Consequently, even though Innocoll AG (formerly known as Innocoll
	GmbH) was only incorporated on July 25, 2013 and was not a group company as at January 1, 2013, or for the period from January
	1, 2013 to the date of the re-domicile, the disclosures in the consolidated financial information for those periods are those
	of Innocoll Holdings, Inc. The 2013 financial information has consequently been presented as if the previous business and operations
	of Innocoll Holdings, Inc. continued as before through each of the accounting periods presented, despite the fact that Innocoll
	AG (formerly known as Innocoll GmbH) became the principal operating and parent entity with effect from July 25, 2013 and was registered
	in the commercial register on August 23, 2013.

	On March 27, 2015, the group approved the conclusion

	million.
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0 0 10PT">
	The loan terms specify that the amounts drawn will
	be used to finance up to 50% of certain research and development and capital expenditures forecast to be made by the company
	over a three year period from 2015 through 2017. The first &euro;15 million of the loan commitment may be drawn at any time
	up to fifteen months from the date of the Finance Contract. The second &euro;10 million may be drawn at any time up to
	eighteen months from the date of the Finance Contract subject to the delivery of clinical data, certified by the management
	board of Innocoll AG, confirming to the satisfaction of EIB that the primary clinical endpoints for either Cogenzia or
	XaraColl Phase 3 trials have been achieved and therefore it can be concluded that the Phase 3 clinical trial has
	successfully been completed. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 12% per annum, compounded annually. There are no cash
	payments of interest required during the term of the loan, interest on the outstanding loan balance accrues daily, and is
	payable only on the maturity date or prepayment date of the loan, whichever is earlier. The maturity date of each tranche is
	three to five years from the draw down date, as may be determined by the company in each draw down request. Principal of the
	loan is payable on the maturity date or the prepayment date, whichever is earlier.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0 0 10PT">
	The loan contains an expenditure covenant requiring the
	company to spend at least 75% of our forecast research and development, and capital expenditures during the period from 2015 to
	2020 as set out in a business plan agreed with the EIB. If, upon completion of the Project, it is determined that the total principal
	amount of the loan drawn by the company exceeds 50% of the total cost of the Project, EIB may cancel the undisbursed portion of
	the loan and demand prepayment of the loan up to the amount by which the loan, excluding accrued interest, exceeds 50% of the
	total cost of the Project.

	All warrants have been classified as a liability due to certain
	provisions pursuant to which the exercise price of the warrants may be reduced in the event that the company issues or sells any
	of its ordinary shares at a price per share less than the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale. Pursuant
	to a notarial deed entered into on June 16, 2014 the shareholders of Innocoll GmbH agreed to amend and terminate all preference,
	redemption and cumulative dividend rights by converting all preferred shares into ordinary shares of Innocoll GmbH, which had
	the effect of increasing the value of the warrants, which were now exercisable over ordinary shares.&nbsp; On July 3, 2014 Innocoll
	GmbH transformed into a German stock corporation Innocoll AG, and Innocoll AG subsequently entered into an amended and restated
	Option Agreement with the warrant holders on July 10, 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp; The warrants issued by Innocoll AG have an initial expiration
	date of June 15, 2019, subject to possible extension for an additional 54 month period subject to a shareholder resolution.&nbsp;
	Innocoll AG issued ADS in its initial public offering priced on July 24, 2014 at a price of $9.00 per ADS, or the equivalent of
	&euro;88.52 per ordinary share.&nbsp; This resulted in the reduction of the exercise price from &euro;100.00 per ordinary share
	to &euro;88.52 per ordinary share pursuant to the above-described exercise price adjustment provision.&nbsp;A follow-on public
	offering in April 2015 was also priced at $9.00 per ADS and therefore the exercise price of the options remains unaffected. In
	addition, as Innocoll AG is a public company post the completion of its initial public offering, the shareholder resolution required
	for the term extension is uncertain, therefore the expiration date for purposes of valuation is assumed to be June 15, 2019. &nbsp;As
	a result of the above described provisions and events, the warrant liability has been valued at &euro;10.6m as of December 31,
	2015 as compared to &euro;7.2m as of December 31, 2014.&nbsp;

	Currency
	risk: The group is subject to currency risk, as its income and expenditures are denominated in euro and US dollar. As such the
	group is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar and the euro. The group aims to match foreign currency cash
	inflows with foreign cash outflows where possible. The group does not hedge this exposure. A 10% movement in the US dollar versus
	euro exchange rate at the year end would have the effect of increasing/decreasing net liabilities by approximately &euro;1.5
	million (2014: &euro;4.0 million).

	to members of its supervisory board, management board and group employees a total of 47,840 restricted shares (&ldquo;Restricted
	Shares&rdquo;) and 63,256 phantom shares (&ldquo;Phantom Shares&rdquo;). The Restricted Share and Phantom Share grants were split

	Each of the Restricted Shares and the Phantom Shares are subject
	to a right of repurchase by the company at nominal value in the case of a Bad Leaver Event prior to an Exit Event. A Bad Leaver
	Event is defined as the grantee&rsquo;s termination of affiliation with the company under certain circumstances. An Exit Event
	is defined as the earlier of the 183rd day after the company successfully completes an IPO, or a liquidity event. A liquidity
	event occurs in the event the company merge or consolidate into or with another entity or vice versa (subject to certain limited
	exceptions), of the sale, conveyance, mortgage, pledge or lease of all or substantially all the company&rsquo;s assets, or of
	the disposition of securities representing a majority of the company&rsquo;s voting power through a transaction or series of related
	transactions. The Restricted Shares were issued as of January 28, 2014 in exchange for payment of nominal value, of &euro;47,840.
	The Phantom Shares may be either settled in cash or a new issue of shares, at the company&rsquo;s option, on the date in which
	the repurchase right lapses.

	The May 2014 Grant occurred simultaneously with a new issue
	of our series E preferred shares. The series E preferred shares were purchased in an arms length transaction by existing investors,
	new supervisory board members who also received restricted stock grants, and three new investors who are partners of one of the
	existing shareholders. The pricing of the series E preferred shares at &euro;112.52 per share was based on third party advice
	obtained by the company&rsquo;s advisory board and managing directors that the price of the company&rsquo;s ADS in an anticipated
	initial public offering would be at least equal to such price or higher. To obtain the series E financing, it was necessary to
	give the investors anti-dilution rights in the event the initial public offering would be priced at a discount to the expected
	valuation. As a result of the initial public offering price of the company&rsquo;s ADS of $9.00 per ADS (which equates to &euro;82.52
	per share), and the anti-dilution rights granted to the series E preferred investors, such investors have been issued additional
	shares at &euro;1.00 per share, as a result of which their weighted average purchase price is equal to &euro;73.76 per share,
	a 16.7% discount to the effective value per ordinary share in our initial public offering. There were no significant valuation
	events at the company between the May 2014 Grant date and date of our initial public offering in July 2014. Therefore we have
	used the E preferred share adjusted weighted average purchase price of &euro;73.76 per share as the value for the share-based
	payment charge arising out of the May 2014 Grant. The share-based payments will be recognized over a one to three year period
	as set out above.

	at 5% of the participant&rsquo;s annual compensation. Contributions to this plan are recorded, as a remuneration expense in the
	consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss)/income. Contributions for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were &euro;0.08

	One of the group&rsquo;s subsidiaries, Syntacoll GmbH, operates
	a defined benefit pension plan in Germany for one of its former employee&rsquo;s who is now deceased. Following the death of the
	plan&rsquo;s only member in 2009, the amounts payable until September 30, 2017 were transferred to the member&rsquo;s widow. The
	total amounts payable relate to the full amount of the deceased employee&rsquo;s life annuity from Syntacoll GmbH. This plan is
	now closed to new members. The plan is managed externally and the related pension costs and liabilities are assessed in accordance
	with the advice of a professionally qualified actuary. Plan assets at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 consisted of units
	held in independently administered funds. The most recent valuation of plan obligations was carried out as at December 31, 2015,
	using the projected unit credit method.

	The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated
	using a discount rate determined by reference to market yields of high quality corporate bonds. The estimated term of the bonds
	is consistent with the estimated term of the defined benefit obligation. A decrease in market yield on high quality corporate
	bonds will increase the group&rsquo;s defined benefit liability, although it is expected that this would be offset partially by
	an increase in the fair value of certain of the plan assets.
