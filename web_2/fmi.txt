	We are a molecular information company focused on fundamentally changing the way in which patients with cancer are evaluated and treated.
	We believe an information-based approach to making clinical treatment decisions based on comprehensive genomic profiling will become a standard of care for patients with cancer. We derive revenue from selling products that are enabled by our
	molecular information platform to physicians and biopharmaceutical companies. Our platform includes proprietary methods and algorithms for analyzing specimens across all types of cancer, and for incorporating that information into clinical care in a
	concise and user-friendly fashion. Our products provide genomic information about each patient&#146;s individual cancer, enabling physicians to optimize treatments in clinical practice and biopharmaceutical companies to develop targeted oncology
	therapies more effectively. We believe we have a significant first mover advantage in providing comprehensive genomic profiling and molecular information products on a commercial scale.

	Our flagship clinical molecular information products, FoundationOne for solid tumors, and FoundationOne Heme for blood-based cancers, or
	hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and advanced sarcomas, are, to our knowledge, the only widely available comprehensive genomic profiles designed for use in the routine care of patients with cancer. To accelerate our
	commercial growth and enhance our competitive advantage, we are continuing to develop and commercialize new molecular information products for physicians and biopharmaceutical companies, strengthen our commercial organization, introduce new
	marketing, education and provider engagement efforts, grow our molecular information knowledgebase, called FoundationCORE, pursue reimbursement from regional and national third-party payors and government payors, publish scientific and medical
	advances, and foster relationships across the oncology community.

	The cancer treatment paradigm is evolving rapidly, and we
	believe there is now widespread recognition that cancer is a disease of the genome, rather than a disease defined solely by its specific anatomical location in the body. Today, physicians increasingly use precision medicines to target cancers based
	on the specific genomic alterations driving their growth. We believe physicians need molecular information about their patients&#146; unique cancers to determine the optimal course of treatment.

	information into a concise and actionable format, and we designed FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme to be such products. We believe a comprehensive approach to providing molecular information
	for use in clinical settings addresses an area of significant unmet medical need for patients suffering from advanced, or active metastatic, cancers. We estimate that there are approximately 1.1&nbsp;million patients per year in the United States
	with newly-diagnosed or recurrent active metastatic cancers who fall into challenging treatment categories, including patients who have rare or aggressive diseases, patients whose disease has progressed after standard treatments, and patients who
	have tested negative under, or been ineligible for, traditional molecular diagnostic tests. We are initially focusing on these patients because we believe this patient population will benefit most from comprehensive molecular information products.

	To maintain our market leadership position and offer physicians and biopharmaceutical companies a full suite of innovative
	molecular information solutions, we developed our third comprehensive genomic profiling product, FoundationACT (

	umor DNA), which we believe is a best-in-class, blood-based (liquid biopsy) assay to evaluate
	circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, which is DNA shed from tumors that circulates in blood plasma outside of cells. We launched FoundationACT for research use to our biopharmaceutical partners in December 2015. We plan to initiate the commercial launch
	of FoundationACT to ordering physicians in March 2016. We believe FoundationACT will become an important molecular information solution for oncologists because it will provide a new option for comprehensive genomic profiling when a tissue biopsy is
	not feasible or when tissue is not available. By analyzing cell-free DNA isolated from a patient&#146;s blood, we can identify clinically relevant genomic alterations in the circulating tumor DNA and match these alterations to targeted therapies and
	clinical trials.

	As the number of available targeted therapies expands and as physicians gain further experience using
	comprehensive molecular information in their routine treatment decisions, we believe that the potentially addressable market for comprehensive molecular information products will expand over the next five years to include most patients who have
	metastatic disease, patients with earlier stage disease, and patients from whom a tissue biopsy is not available. We estimate that this potential U.S. market expansion could include an additional 900,000 total patients for FoundationOne,
	FoundationOne Heme, and FoundationACT, bringing the total number of patients who could benefit from our approach in the U.S. to approximately 2&nbsp;million on an annual basis.

	We believe we have a significant first mover advantage in building the only commercially available molecular information platform that
	comprehensively assesses cancer simultaneously for all four classes of genomic alterations (i.e., base pair substitutions, copy number alterations, short insertions and deletions, or indels, and gene rearrangements) across all cancer-related genes
	with the sensitivity and specificity required for routine medical practice. We published our analytic validation for FoundationOne in
<I>
	Nature Biotechnology
</I>
	in October 2013, and we anticipate publishing a similar validation for FoundationOne
	Heme in 2016. We presented analytic validation data for FoundationACT at the 2016 Advances in Genome Biology and Technology Conference demonstrating that our assay achieves very high unique coverage from limited ctDNA input which enables accurate
	detection of base substitutions, indels, and genomic rearrangements at very low tumor content, as well as copy number amplifications with performance specifications equivalent to those for FoundationOne. FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme deliver,
	and FoundationACT, when commercialized, will deliver this complex molecular information in a concise report that matches detected molecular alterations with potentially relevant treatment options, including clinical trials.

	We believe the genomic alterations identified for each patient should be accompanied by the most current and relevant scientific and
	medical literature related to those alterations, and that this information should be presented in a clear and concise manner. Our molecular information knowledgebase, FoundationCORE, stores this genomic alteration data and currently includes more
	than 68,000 genomic profiles. Test reports are now available to physicians using FoundationICE, the newest version of our online Interactive Cancer Explorer, which we made available to select providers in December 2014 and launched in May 2015 at
	the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO. We believe FoundationICE will help physicians to more efficiently use our clinical products and will enhance the utility of comprehensive genomic profiling.

	We believe our unique and proprietary decision support applications are a competitive
	differentiator of our comprehensive molecular information solutions and may accelerate the broad adoption of our products and create an important network effect among users. These applications are designed to integrate with physician workflow and
	enhance the actionability of our molecular information, enabling physicians to make informed therapeutic decisions. For example, an important component of FoundationICE is PatientMatch, a technology application that enables physician-to-physician
	connections to facilitate sharing of treatment decisions and clinical outcomes data for patients with similar genomic profiles, in a manner compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. In September 2015, we
	announced the expansion of our suite of molecular information-based products with GeneKit. GeneKit is a pathology-focused genomics solution that facilitates rapid interpretation and report generation for next generation sequencing, or NGS, assays of
	up to 50 genes. GeneKit provides a reflex option to our assays, FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, and FoundationACT, should the more narrowly focused third-party molecular diagnostics tests fail to identify a genomic alteration in a patient&#146;s

	Our molecular information solutions address significant unmet needs in the market and enable providers and their
	patients to identify relevant treatment options, including potential access to clinical trials. We believe the current system for patients to access clinical trials in the United States is highly inefficient. Approximately 3% of patients with cancer
	in the United States are enrolled in clinical trials. To overcome this challenge of patient access to clinical trials and precision therapies, we launched a pilot program in October 2015 called SmartTrials. This program provides physicians with
	information on certain enrolling studies of investigational, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies based on the genomic alterations identified in the patient&#146;s tumor sample. We believe this program may be a catalyst for precision medicine by
	enabling greater patient access to personalized therapies and simultaneously, enabling our biopharmaceutical partners to accelerate drug development.

	FoundationOne currently assesses 315
	biologically relevant cancer genes for all classes of genomic alterations with high sensitivity and specificity. We believe FoundationOne identifies genomic alterations that other commercially available diagnostic tests cannot. FoundationOne Heme
	employs RNA sequencing of 265 genes in addition to DNA sequencing of 405 genes to detect all classes of genomic alterations across genes known to be altered other than through inherited genetic characteristics, which are also known as somatic
	alterations, in hematologic malignancies, pediatric cancers, and sarcomas, which we believe also will lead to the identification of clinically relevant information. FoundationACT, which we launched to our biopharmaceutical partners in December 2015
	for research use, identifies in a cancer patient&#146;s blood all known clinically relevant alterations in 62 genes altered in human solid tumors that are validated targets for therapy or are unambiguous drivers of cancer. The assay has been
	optimized to overcome the tremendous challenges of detecting low quantities of ctDNA in blood and has been analytically validated for high accuracy across all classes of genomic alterations;

	: We provide our partners with companion diagnostic development and support to help drive their precision medicine
	strategies. We utilize the FoundationOne laboratory platform under quality system regulation, or QSR, to enable access to individual targeted therapies with the aim of developing companion diagnostic assays having a premarket approval, or PMA, from
	the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We are currently working with Clovis and Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., or Mirati, among others, to develop their companion diagnostic approach. We believe the total addressable market for
	companion diagnostics is in excess of $100 million over the next five years.

	Our product development investments have already yielded enhancements to FoundationOne and the platform generally, enabling us to analyze more genes, using less tissue, while reducing turn-around time. We also utilize RNA-based sequencing technology
	to analyze additional gene fusions commonly found in hematologic malignancies and sarcomas, and we launched FoundationOne Heme, which incorporates this technology, in December 2013. In addition, our efforts to reliably and accurately detect ctDNA

	More recently, oncologists are integrating a precision medicine approach by utilizing therapeutics that target cancers based on the specific genomic alterations driving their growth. We believe the
	oncology community is generally beginning to change clinical practice so that oncologists treat each individual&#146;s cancer according to its unique genomic alterations that impact the underlying biological pathways within the patient&#146;s
	cancer, rather than treating a patient&#146;s cancer based solely on its initial anatomical location in the body, such as the breast, colon or lung.&nbsp;In addition, as a result of advancements in cancer biology and genomic technology that enable
	the identification of new cancer genes, biopharmaceutical companies are directing more research and development resources towards targeted therapies. There are currently more than 50 approved targeted oncology therapies on the market and
	approximately 3,100 active clinical trials. More than 830 compounds are in development for the treatment of cancer and, of these compounds, 73% are personalized medicines. In 2014, according to IMS Health, global sales of targeted oncology therapies

	The rapid increase in molecular information
	related to cancer, as well as the increasing array of targeted oncology therapeutics, is making it more difficult for physicians to make treatment decisions. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network estimates that 50% to 75% of cancer therapies in
	the United States are used off label, meaning that physicians prescribe therapies for clinical indications in manners different from those approved by FDA. Off-label usage of traditional cytotoxic therapies is often driven by physicians struggling
	to treat a patient&#146;s disease after it fails to respond to initial treatment regimens. Targeted therapies are used off label by oncologists who have expertise in genomics or access to diagnostic tools that allow them to make informed decisions
	about off-label use of targeted therapies.

	Most currently available molecular diagnostic tests are single-marker or limited gene &#147;hotspot&#148; panel tests that capture only

	number alterations; short indels; and gene rearrangements and fusions.&nbsp;Hotspot panel tests generally are only able to identify base pair substitutions and specific gene rearrangements, do not routinely detect copy number alterations, and often
	lack the sensitivity to identify short indels. In addition, hotspot panel tests are typically incapable of detecting gene fusions, a type of alteration that is a common driver of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and pediatric cancers, and certain

	Many clinical tumor samples are provided from standard biopsies, needle biopsies or fine needle aspirates that yield very small tissue

<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">
	Physicians today face an increasingly difficult decision about which single-marker or hotspot panel tests to order. There are a growing number of tests, each specific to a different cancer type and each
	having limited ability to detect multiple genomic alterations. Often, in the case of solid tumors, only a small amount of tumor biopsy is available, forcing the physician to order only a subset of desired diagnostic tests, often one test at a time
	in a serial manner. Furthermore, tests are usually selected based on the traditional treatment paradigm of the cancer&#146;s location in the body or by simple trial and error. Integration of molecular diagnostics into clinical practice is
	particularly challenging with hematologic cancers in which lack of tissue distinctions within the cancers often lead to misdiagnosis, lack of prognostic information and, thus, mistreatment.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX; TEXT-INDENT:4%">
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">
	Running multiple, disjointed tests also poses logistical challenges associated with routing samples to several different laboratories and
	high costs associated with conducting multiple tests. Moreover, limited tissue availability may prevent relevant tests from being ordered, tests conducted may miss genomic alterations, and the results may not be delivered soon enough to be used
	during the typical treatment cycle for a patient. Even if a physician has enough cancer specimen to order a sufficient number of hotspot panel tests and single gene molecular tests to identify relevant genomic alterations and receives the results of
	all of these tests in a timely fashion, the physician would commonly receive a series of uncoordinated individual reports from different laboratories that are difficult for non-specialized pathologists or other physicians to interpret and
	synthesize. Compounding these challenges, especially in the community oncology setting, is how to effectively match the genomic information provided by tests with current targeted therapies or clinical trials for a particular patient. As a result of
	one or a combination of these current limitations, physicians may fail to identify or to prescribe a potentially appropriate targeted oncology therapy or to direct a patient to a potentially appropriate clinical trial.

	biopharmaceutical companies in the development of novel cancer therapeutics. The first molecular information products enabled by our platform are FoundationOne, which is optimized for use with solid tumors, FoundationOne Heme, which is optimized for
	hematologic cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma, as well as many sarcomas, and FoundationACT, which is optimized for use with liquid (blood) samples when solid tumor tissue specimens are insufficient. FoundationOne, our initial
	clinical product launched in June 2012, is a comprehensive genomic profile that identifies the individual molecular alterations present in a patient&#146;s cancer tumor and matches them with relevant targeted therapies and clinical trials.
	FoundationOne Heme, our second commercially available product, which we developed in collaboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, or MSKCC, and launched in December 2013, is a comprehensive genomic profile that identifies the
	individual molecular alterations present in a patient&#146;s blood-based cancer and matches them with relevant targeted therapies and clinical trials. FoundationACT, our third molecular information product, enables comprehensive genomic profiling
	from a blood sample when a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained. FoundationACT was launched to our biopharmaceutical partners for research use in December 2015, and we plan to launch to ordering physicians in March 2016.

	FoundationOne interrogates the genes known to be somatically altered in human solid tumors that are validated targets for
	therapy or are unambiguous drivers of cancer. We have selected this set of genes based upon the advice of an international group of key opinion leaders, or KOLs, in oncology and cancer biology, input offered by our biopharmaceutical partners and an
	extensive review of the relevant literature. The current version of FoundationOne interrogates the entire coding sequence of 315 cancer-related genes for base substitutions, short indels, and copy number alterations, as well as select intronic
	regions of 28 genes commonly involved in rearrangements. FoundationOne Heme interrogates genes somatically altered in hematologic malignancies and sarcomas that are validated targets for therapy or unambiguous drivers of cancer based on current
	scientific knowledge. The current version of FoundationOne Heme interrogates 265 cancer-related genes for gene fusions through RNA sequencing and 405 cancer-related genes through DNA sequencing for base substitutions, short indels, and copy number
	alterations, as well as certain intronic regions of 31&nbsp;commonly rearranged genes. FoundationOne Heme has been specifically validated to detect gene fusions, a type of alteration that is a common driver in hematologic malignancies, sarcomas, and
	pediatric cancers, with high accuracy. Both tests include those genes implicated in cancers for which a targeted therapy is FDA-approved and for which targeted therapies are in current or near-term clinical development. We update our tests
	periodically to reflect new scientific and medical knowledge about cancer biology, including newly relevant cancer genes along with those genes for which there are newly available targeted therapeutics and clinical trials.

	conducted on previously characterized cell lines known to contain various base substitutions and cancer specimens known to contain various indels and copy number alterations to evaluate whether FoundationOne was capable of detecting these
	pre-defined genomic alterations. FoundationOne was found to be highly sensitive in identifying these genomic alterations even where the percentage of cells in test samples containing the alterations (versus normal cells not containing the
	alterations) was very low. Specifically, FoundationOne was able to detect 99% of base substitutions contained in test samples in which less than 10% of the cells contained the base substitutions, 97% of indels in samples in which 10% to 20% of the
	cells contained the indels, and 99% of copy number alterations of at least 8-fold in which 30% of the cells contained the alterations. In aggregate, FoundationOne detected

	FoundationACT, an assay which enables
	genomic profiling of ctDNA, has undergone extensive analytic validation demonstrating that the assay exceeds requirements for clinical use. Circulating cell-free DNA is highly fragmented, present at very low concentrations in the blood, and contains
	only a small fraction of ctDNA. We believe many cancer patients may not shed enough detectable tumor DNA into their bloodstream and may thus test negative using ctDNA assays. Therefore, the isolation and identification of ctDNA is extremely
	challenging. Assay sensitivity and specificity is directly dependent on cell-free DNA extraction and circulating tumor evaluation, high efficiency sample preparation, and capture efficiency combined with custom low frequency variant calling
	algorithms. We have optimized FoundationACT for sensitivity and specificity of base substitutions, indels, genomic rearrangements, and copy number amplifications. The workflow for FoundationACT is highly reproducible, achieves the required
	turnaround time, and is compatible with whole blood, plasma and cell-free DNA inputs.

	available, we launched a large, multi-center study to assess the potential utility of this test across various cancers and stages of the disease as well as to refine indications for use. The study will provide additional analytic validation by
	establishing concordance of the test in detecting genomic alterations from ctDNA as compared to alterations detected in tissue biopsies assessed by FoundationOne. We expect to publish results from this study.

	After the initial diagnosis, she began an aggressive treatment plan, including enrolling in a clinical trial with a non-genomically

	largest nodule was 18 mm. The disease continued to progress and subsequent imaging showed multiple lung nodules greater than 3 cm, with the largest nearly 7 cm, a large increase in size. A FoundationOne Heme test was administered and detected an

	A
	54 year old woman presented with irregular vaginal bleeding and was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. She underwent a hysterectomy and was diagnosed with an early stage but high grade endometrioid-type endometrial cancer. The patient declined to
	undergo radiation therapy and thereafter rapidly developed new abdominal masses, with biopsy showing recurrent cancer. She was then treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and did well for two years. At that time, the
	patient developed bulky lymph nodes near her neck, which when biopsied showed a second recurrence of the endometrial tumor. Imaging showed the disease encased the large veins from the lower half of her body, resulting in swelling of both legs, which
	significantly impeded her quality of life.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX; TEXT-INDENT:4%">
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">
	The patient then enrolled in a clinical trial of a check point inhibitor.
	Following administration with the check point inhibitor, she rapidly felt better, as the swelling in her legs was dramatically reduced. Imaging showed a partial response at 8 weeks, and this response has been maintained for 10 months.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PX;MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PX; TEXT-INDENT:4%">
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">
	To understand this dramatic response, the primary tumor was sent for FoundationOne testing. There were 32 genomic alterations (GA)
	identified which is a high number relative to an average of 3-5 across cancers. Also, a mutation in DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) was identified, which impairs how this enzyme corrects errors in the tumor genome. This GA could thus explain the
	hypermutated phenotype. This is about -5-10 times higher than the &#145;average&#146; tumor. In addition, there were 113 &#147;variants of unknown significance&#148;, also a very high number relative to other cancer cases. Therefore, this
	patient&#146;s tumor exhibits an extraordinarily high mutation burden consistent with the hypermutator phenotype described for POLE mutant endometrial cancers, which likely correlates to durable clinical benefit she received from a checkpoint
	inhibitor.

	2014, we announced a collaboration with WuXi PharmaTech Inc., or WuXi, who is performing the laboratory component of our tests for our biopharmaceutical partners in its laboratories in Shanghai. Our partnership with WuXi allows us to offer our
	comprehensive genomic profiles to biopharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials in China. We expect our biopharmaceutical partner relationships will continue to expand and will provide more opportunities to sell our molecular information

	can be particularly challenging as new data emerges that is specific to each cancer type. In 2013, approximately 30% of our test volume was driven by physicians in community practices. In each of 2014 and 2015, approximately 60% of our test volume

	We believe that if we can continue to integrate the results of our products into the everyday clinical practice of
	oncologists, we will become an even more important partner in their efforts to treat patients with cancer. Our goal is for physicians to use the latest version of our Interactive Cancer Explorer, FoundationICE, in the context of their busy clinical
	practices, to shape each patient&#146;s treatment plan. Through FoundationICE we deliver the key genomic information identified by our tests in an organized fashion along with access to current information about the reported genomic alterations,
	associated therapies, and clinical trials. FoundationICE presents complex genomic information in what was designed as a practice-friendly interface that links directly into publicly available databases, such as PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov. The
	portal also provides direct links or references to journal articles and clinical trials information relevant to a patient&#146;s identified genomic alterations. Over time, we intend for FoundationICE to link to additional public and private data
	sources as we continue to rationalize, correlate, and incorporate disparate sources of information into our products. By making this information more readily accessible to physicians, we aim to make it easier for them to bring new, relevant
	information to each patient&#146;s treatment plan.

	An important new component of FoundationICE is PatientMatch, a technology
	application that leverages the experience of more than 68,000 genomic profiles already in FoundationCORE to increase the utility of our test results. Using PatientMatch, physicians within the FoundationICE network are able to connect with other
	physicians treating patients with similar disease profiles (tumor type and genomic alteration(s)) and share treatment and outcome information in a HIPAA-compliant manner. FoundationICE also has a number of important efficiency-improving features to
	help physicians care for their patients, including the ability to track samples through our pipeline before we report the results and in-application notifications. Another new feature in FoundationICE is advanced search, which allows physicians to
	search across all of their patients by gene, alteration, and tumor type. Practice administrators and researchers can use this same capability to query patients across their entire institution. We believe FoundationICE and PatientMatch will be
	important applications to support and accelerate the broad adoption of our products, build client relationships, and create an important network effect among users. We believe the better we can integrate our solutions into a physician&#146;s routine
	clinical practice, including through EMR integration, the more likely a physician is to order our products.

	In this study, MSKCC and our researchers used FoundationOne Heme to analyze routine
	cancer specimens from 746 patients with a range of hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. The data from the study, which was presented at ASH&#146;s annual meeting in December 2014, demonstrated the feasibility of
	comprehensive genomic profiling in patients with hematologic malignancies. FoundationOne Heme was shown to enable the identification of genomic alterations that are molecular drivers of the observed patients&#146; cancers which may help to expand
	and inform treatment options for individual patients, advance the development of new therapies against these targets, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. In addition, robust analytic validity was demonstrated. Publication of the associated
	manuscript is anticipated later this year.

	neutral facilitator of oncology stakeholders, with important insight and relationships across industry, advocacy, and regulatory bodies. Through these activities, we have developed the basis for a meaningful advocacy relations program, with
	opportunities to more strategically engage advocates moving forward. During 2014 and 2015, we worked with 16 lung cancer advocacy groups in a campaign called &#147;Don&#146;t Guess. Test.&#148; to raise awareness about the importance of
	comprehensive genomic profiling for patients with lung cancer. We expect to continue similar efforts in 2016 and beyond.

	Together with EmergingMed, we launched an innovative patient-centric program called FoundationAccess Trial Navigator through which we are
	offering personalized clinical trial navigation services to help health care providers and their patients who have received our tests to identify and access appropriate clinical trials based on their specific genomic profiles and clinical
	characteristics. We believe these clinical trial enrollment support services will increase the ability of physicians to act on comprehensive genomic profiling results and more frequently consider clinical trial enrollment while making treatment
	decisions. Additionally, through FoundationAccess Careline, which we offer through our partnership with the Patient Advocate Foundation, we provide personalized case management services to patients who are uninsured, underinsured or insured, but who
	are facing obstacles obtaining prescribed targeted therapies that are approved in an indication other than their tumor type. We help these patients navigate appropriate channels to secure treatments by leveraging peer-reviewed literature supporting
	their use, as well as the reimbursement system to help cover treatment costs and the costs associated with our tests. We believe this will increase the ability of physicians to act on our test results. Further, through FoundationICE and PatientMatch
	we are helping to connect physicians with their peers who have seen patients with similar genomic profiles in order to learn about their peers&#146; treatment decisions and related outcomes. Lastly, through our collaboration with Roche, we are
	uniquely positioned to deliver access programs when the results of our comprehensive genomic profiles reveal molecular alterations that can be treated by one of Roche&#146;s oncologic agents. In these situations, we offer drug access support,
	financial assistance programs, and clinical trial connectivity and enrollment support in close collaboration with Roche. We believe this patient-centric service is unique to our business and gives patients access to targeted anti-cancer agents from
	one of the leading drug developers in cancer. Each of these areas of focus provides tangible steps our clinical partners can take to enhance the actionability of the results of our comprehensive genomic profiling assays.

	Setting a High Bar for Validation and Performance.
</B>
	Our tests provide clinically relevant results that are highly reproducible and sensitive, and
	we believe that a majority of our relevant findings would not be detected by many other commercial tests on the market today. Patients may benefit from our detection of otherwise unknown genomic alterations that can lead to their physicians choosing
	alternate therapies. We have presented data on the reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and comprehensive scope of our products at numerous conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. In October 2013, the analytic validation results of our
	studies on FoundationOne were published in
<I>
	Nature Biotechnology
</I>
	. In 2014, we received approval from the New York State Department of Health for FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme, which represents a high standard for quality in large-scale,
	multi-gene sequencing-based testing in cancer. Also in 2014, Palmetto GBA, or Palmetto, an influential Medicare Administrative Contractor, or MAC, published validation guidelines for NGS tests. In May 2015, Palmetto published a final local coverage
	determination, or LCD, that outlines the rigorous validation requirements for coverage and reimbursement of comprehensive genomic profiles in certain forms of cancer, and we believe our products meet those validation criteria.

	We
	are initially focused on obtaining reimbursement coverage from third-party payors for patients in six specific clinical indications, including (1)&nbsp;patients with newly-diagnosed stage IV NSCLC, (2)&nbsp;patients with newly-diagnosed cancer of
	unknown origin or unknown primary anatomic site, (3)&nbsp;patients with newly-diagnosed stage IV rare or uncommon solid tumors for whom very limited or no systemic treatment options exist in clinical care guidelines or pathways, (4)&nbsp;patients
	with newly-diagnosed stage IV solid tumors who have received limited to no benefit from standard chemotherapy and whose tumors typically include a high prevalence of clinically relevant genomic alterations, (5)&nbsp;patients with solid tumors whose
	available biopsy sample proves insufficient for traditional molecular diagnostic testing, and (6)&nbsp;patients with stage IV solid tumors who have exhausted the established guideline driven systemic therapy or therapies but who maintain adequate
	functional status as deemed by their treating physician. After obtaining reimbursement coverage for one or more of these six initial clinical indications, we may seek broader coverage for additional indications.

	In October 2014, we announced a formal agreement with Priority Health, a regional commercial third-party payor in Michigan, for broad
	coverage of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme. We believe this was an important initial coverage agreement given that it includes both of these products and covers five of the six initial clinical indications noted above for FoundationOne. We
	also publicly announced that HealthChoice Oklahoma and one additional regional payer in southern California had each enacted broad, pan-cancer coverage policies for FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme for their members. Several large, self-insuring
	organizations also enacted coverage as part of broad, best-in-class employee benefits packages. In December 2015, we announced an agreement with UnitedHealthcare, one of the largest insurers in the United States. The agreement covers FoundationOne
	for patients with initially diagnosed metastatic stage IV NSCLC. We believe this agreement is another important step towards broader reimbursement for our comprehensive genomic profiling assays as we continue to demonstrate clinical and economic
	evidence supporting coverage and payment for our products in additional cancer types.

	largest health insurer, and COTA to initiate a prospective clinical study measuring changes in survival benefit and total cost savings achieved among patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC who undergo comprehensive genomic profiling
	with FoundationOne versus other molecular testing or no testing. The study enables Horizon Healthcare Services to provide its members with coverage for FoundationOne as a critical component of clinical care pathways in the evaluation of patients

	The current list price for the FoundationOne test is $5,800, and the current list price for
	the FoundationOne Heme test is $7,200. The list price for FoundationACT will be released when we commercially launch this test, which we expect to do in March 2016. Payment for the tests is not certain and may come from various sources. Actual
	payment will often be less than the list prices. Sources of current or potential payment include: (1)&nbsp;commercial third-party payors, such as health insurance or managed care plans; (2)&nbsp;government health benefit programs such as Medicare
	and Medicaid; (3)&nbsp;other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, accountable care organizations, cancer centers, and other institutions; (4)&nbsp;international distributors; and (5)&nbsp;individual patients.

	Currently, the significant majority of commercial third-party payors reimburse our claims based upon stacked CPT codes, the predominant
	methodology, or based on other methods such as percentages of charges or other formulas that are not made known to us. In addition, a small portion of payors outsource our claims to preferred provider organizations or third-party administrators, who
	process our claims and pay us directly at negotiated rates. Coverage and payment is determined by the third-party payor on a case-by-case basis.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we were not a participating provider in any state Medicaid program, and, therefore did not have coverage decisions under which our tests were covered by these Medicaid
	programs. We are a participating provider in the Medicare program, but, as described below, currently no specific Medicare national or finalized local coverage determinations in our region for FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme with established

	We submit claims for our
	products to commercial third-party payors using CPT codes for molecular testing services. We receive payments on some, but not all, of our claims submitted. In 2014, new CPT codes were approved by the American Medical Association, or AMA, that are
	intended to classify with greater specificity those molecular tests that rely on NGS and evaluate multiple genes at once. These new CPT Codes became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2015. We do not believe that these new CPT codes describe our tests
	since they do not appropriately differentiate our comprehensive genomic profiles from hotspot panel tests. Therefore, unless payors specifically request use of these new CPT codes, we intend to continue submitting claims for our tests utilizing
	methodologies that we believe are more effective under the circumstances, including stacked CPT codes, McKesson Z-Codes (as described below), and other potential approaches.

	Since we are not currently a participating provider with many commercial third-party payors, payment for our test remains largely uncertain. We request that physicians discuss with their patients the
	potential responsibility of the patient for the cost of our products should the patient&#146;s insurance policy not cover those costs. We undertake the primary responsibility for obtaining third-party reimbursement on behalf of patients, including
	appeals for any initial denials, prior to billing a patient. With this practice established, we believe that most patients receiving our tests know that they may be responsible for some portion of the cost of the test should their third-party payor
	deny or limit coverage. We also offer a comprehensive patient assistance program, FoundationAccess, to support patients whose incomes are below certain thresholds and to allow for extended payment terms, as necessary, given the patient&#146;s

	We are enrolled in the Medicare program in order to bill Medicare for the tests we perform for the
	benefit of Medicare patients. There is currently no national coverage determination in effect or under consideration to our knowledge that provides for or contemplates a consideration for coverage of our tests by Medicare. In the absence of national
	coverage determinations for our tests, MACs have some discretion in determining coverage, and, therefore, payment for our tests is based on using an LCD process. When FoundationOne was launched in 2012, our then-current MAC requested that we not

	The claims submitted to National Government Services use a miscellaneous CPT code, which is used for submitting claims for services or

	submitted with that miscellaneous code. The claims submitted to National Government Services may be denied or paid, in whole or in part. If a claim is denied or paid in part, we may decide to appeal the denied claim or any denied portion of the
	claim. National Government Services may also issue a non-coverage determination for any or all of our products that would apply to future claims, or National Government Services may defer processing or paying a claim pending the issuance of a

	In February 2016, National Government Services announced a final LCD, effective in April&nbsp;1, 2016, which includes
	reimbursement for hotspot panel tests of 5 to 50 genes for patients with metastatic NSCLC. We do not believe this LCD reflects coverage for our validated comprehensive genomic profiling products. We will continue to engage National Government
	Services to pursue coverage and reimbursement for comprehensive genomic profiling, and given the multiple potential outcomes that could result from the submission of our claims to National Government Services, we may determine to provide appropriate
	advance notices to patients covered by Medicare to enable us to bill a Medicare patient for all or part of a claim that is denied coverage by National Government Services. Based on the response of National Government Services to our submitted
	claims, we will also assess our ability to submit claims to Medicare, or bill Medicare patients, for previously reported tests. If we submit claims for these tests, and if Medicare denies coverage for these previously reported tests, our ability to
	bill Medicare patients for such tests will be limited.

	To assist payors in making reimbursement and coverage decisions, the
	McKesson Diagnostics Exchange&#153;, or McKesson DEX, has been created. Tests that are registered with McKesson DEX are assigned, based on the uniqueness of each test, a five-digit alphanumeric McKesson Z-Code&#153; identifier, or Z-Code. These
	identifiers are intended to enable the consistent identification of tests across systems by laboratories, providers, and payors. Because we believe the current CPT codes associated with our tests do not adequately address the comprehensive and
	precise characteristics of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme, we have established unique Z-Codes for FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme, and expect to establish a unique Z-code for FoundationACT.

	For FoundationOne, where samples are submitted as FFPE blocks or slides, our first step is pathology review, in which we assess the quality of the tissue sample to determine if it is suitable for testing
	using FoundationOne. We are able to process samples for testing using a very small amount of DNA. In general, the sample must be at least 40 microns in thickness and consist of at least 20% tumor cells. Almost all samples meeting our tissue
	requirements will allow extraction of enough high-quality DNA (50 nanograms) for FoundationOne for solid tumor analysis.

	For
	FoundationOne Heme samples submitted as FFPE blocks or slides, the process is exactly as outlined for FoundationOne above except that we extract both DNA and RNA from these specimens, 50 nanograms and 300 nanograms, respectively, and the requisite
	tissue thickness is 80 microns.&nbsp;For FoundationOne Heme samples that are received as fresh peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate, we prepare a smear and perform a morphologic review in order to confirm adequate cellularity and tumor/lesional
	tissue content (e.g., 20%) before the specimen is sequenced.

	Following FoundationOne test ordering, pathology review, and DNA

	separate DNA fragments from the relevant cancer genes through our proprietary hybrid capture process. After hybrid capture, we are ready to interrogate the DNA content to determine where the critical genomic alterations exist.

	The content of each DNA or cDNA molecule is determined using a

	can be applied to genes throughout the entire cancer genome. Our products are able to detect genomic alterations that may be present in as low as 1% of all cells being tested. We have made substantial modifications to our process in order to

	derived from prior standard diagnostic tests. For example, in validation studies on actual clinical cancer specimens, including samples where as few as 20% of the nuclei in the specimen were derived from tumor cells, high accuracy for FoundationOne
	was observed across all classes of genomic alterations, including sensitivity greater than 99% for detection of base substitutions, greater than 98% for detection of indels, and greater than 95% for detection of copy number alterations. Our

	We believe our products are currently the only commercially available comprehensive molecular information products that provide a fully
	informative genomic profile in a concise and actionable format designed for use in the clinical setting. Our principal competition comes from existing large and small commercial diagnostic companies, as well as certain medical institutions that
	offer single-marker or hotspot panel tests that can capture only the most common and known gene alterations and a limited set of gene rearrangements. Although these tests assess only a limited number of genes and are unable to detect copy number
	alterations and often miss short indels, in many circumstances, these are the diagnostic methods that physicians use and have used for many years. It may be difficult to change the methods or behavior of the referring physicians to incorporate our
	products into their practices. In addition, academic research centers and NGS platform developers are offering or developing NGS-based testing intended to be comprehensive for known cancer genes that may seek to compete with our products on the
	number of genes they interrogate. We have also observed increased competition from companies that offer similar molecular information tests. However, we are not aware of any of these third-party tests having sufficient sensitivity and specificity,
	operational scale, or reporting elements to fit the realities of current clinical practice, including volume and quality limits of tumor samples, demands on turnaround time, and ease of use.

	We may face competition from companies that offer products or have conducted research to profile genes and gene expression in various
	cancers. Personalized genetic diagnostics is a new area of science, and we cannot predict what tests others will develop that may compete with or provide results comparable or superior to the results we are able to achieve. Our competitors include
	laboratory companies such as Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, Molecular Health, Caris Life Sciences, Guardant Health, Paradigm, NeoGenomics Laboratories, as well as
	companies that manufacture or may manufacture diagnostic testing kits such as Abbott Laboratories, Qiagen N.V. and Sequenom, Inc. These kits, which companies often include with capital equipment and reagents to local pathology laboratories, can be
	used directly by the physician, which can facilitate adoption. In addition, companies such as Genomic Health, Inc. and Myriad Genetics, Inc. have well-established commercial organizations that sell molecular diagnostic tests to physicians and may
	develop tests which compete with our products on price.

	In addition to developing kits, certain life sciences and diagnostic companies also provide NGS platforms. Illumina,
	Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., and other companies develop NGS platforms that are being sold directly to research centers, pharmaceutical companies, and clinical laboratories. While many of the applications for these platforms are focused on the
	research and development markets and others are focused on testing for non-cancer conditions, each of these companies has launched and may continue to commercialize products used in the clinical oncology market. We believe diagnostic platform
	providers will seek to place sequencing machines in laboratories to develop sequencing-based laboratory based testing services. In addition, Illumina has received FDA-approval for a diagnostic kit for clinical use outside of oncology, which is sold
	to clients who have purchased its platforms. We believe Illumina and other diagnostic platform providers may develop additional FDA-approved diagnostic kits for clinical use by clients who have purchased their platforms, potentially including for
	these clients to identify genomic alterations in samples from solid tumors or blood-based cancers. Many private companies are developing information technology-based tools to support the integration of NGS testing into the clinical setting. These
	companies could have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do and may be more successful than we may be in achieving widespread market acceptance. Any tests they develop may be more effective, or more effectively
	marketed and sold, than FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, or FoundationACT.

	There is tremendous excitement within the oncology community about the promise of liquid biopsy assays for their potential to improve
	cancer diagnosis and optimize patient care. We believe that a ctDNA assay is an important tool for providers when a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained or when tissue has been depleted. There are a variety of techniques for analyzing ctDNA for a single
	gene or multiple genes. We believe we have developed a best-in-class, reliable, and comprehensive ctDNA assay, FoundationACT, that provides new options for patients when tissue is not accessible. Developed with input from our biopharmaceutical
	partners, we believe FoundationACT includes the most clinically relevant gene list that is technologically feasible without being cost-prohibitive. We believe our ctDNA assay has unparalleled accuracy with 99% positive predictive value.
	FoundationACT has been analytically validated for all four types of alterations.

	Class II devices are subject to FDA&#146;s general controls, and any other special
	controls, such as performance standards, postmarket surveillance, and FDA guidelines, deemed necessary by FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the devices&#146; safety and effectiveness. Premarket review and clearance by FDA for Class II devices
	are accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, although some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements. Premarket notifications are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies. To obtain 510(k)
	clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is &#147;substantially equivalent&#148; to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared 510(k) device or a preamendment device that was in
	commercial distribution before May&nbsp;28, 1976, for which FDA has not yet called for the submission of a premarket approval, or PMA, application. In determining substantial equivalence, FDA assesses whether the proposed device has the same
	intended use and technical characteristic as the predicate device, or whether the proposed device has different technological characteristics, but the information submitted in the premarket notification demonstrates the device is as safe and
	effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. FDA may request additional information, including clinical data. Under the FDCA, a manufacturer must submit a
	premarket notification at least 90 days before introducing a device into interstate commerce, but FDA&#146;s review of the premarket notification can take significantly longer. If FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent to the
	predicate device(s), the subject device may be marketed. However, if FDA determines that a device is not substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), then the device would be regulated as a Class III device, discussed below. If a
	manufacturer obtains a 510(k) clearance for its device and then makes a modification that could significantly affect the device&#146;s safety or effectiveness, a new premarket notification must be submitted to FDA.

	premarket review&#151;either a 510(k) or a PMA&#151;would likely be required for our test if FDA no longer applies its enforcement discretion to LDTs. While the data requirements are typically greater for Class III devices, the data required for
	Class II devices has increased, and it is possible that some amount of clinical data (retrospective or prospective or both) would be required for either type of submission. Currently, FDA is undertaking a review of the adequacy of the 510(k)
	process. It is difficult to predict what changes may result, but it should be assumed that any changes will increase, not decrease, the regulatory requirements. We believe that products we may develop in the future for use as companion diagnostic

	The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by health care providers and other covered entities.
	They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a health care provider, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information,
	or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is
	electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HITECH Act, among other things, established certain protected health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify affected individual(s) and the United
	States Department of Health and Human Services when there is a breach of unsecured protected health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal &#147;floor&#148; that health care providers must meet and do not
	supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information. Massachusetts, for example, has a state law

	In
	the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for patient referrals for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering or
	arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any health care item or service reimbursable under a governmental payor program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the
	arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal health care program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to
	include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback
	Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a series of regulatory &#147;safe harbors.&#148; These safe harbor
	regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti- Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against
	prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal
	Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Penalties for federal anti-kickback violations are severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Many states also
	have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.

	Legislation defining two new federal crimes related to health care were recently enacted: health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits
	knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from governmental payor programs such as the
	Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery
	of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from governmental payor programs.

	Finally, another development affecting the health care industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in
	particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act&#146;s &#147;whistleblower&#148; or &#147;qui tam&#148; provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes
	to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal governmental payor program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the
	defendant has defrauded the federal government by submitting a false claim to the federal government and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to
	have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim.

	individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010, faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.

	Under a federal law directed at &#147;self-referral,&#148; commonly known as the &#147;Stark Law,&#148; there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on referrals for certain designated health
	services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment or ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, an entity
	performing the tests. The prohibition also extends to payment for any testing referred in violation of the Stark Law. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law&#146;s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such
	arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per bill submission, an
	assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payor programs. Bills submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any
	amounts with respect to any such prohibited bill is obligated to refund such amounts. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.

	Numerous states have enacted laws
	prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to
	prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California&#146;s Medical Board has indicated that determining what diagnostic tests are appropriate for a particular condition and
	taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of the patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these
	corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us and/or the professional through licensure proceedings. Typically such laws are only applicable to entities that have a physical
	presence in the state.

	We believe our commercial success is dependent upon our ability to successfully market and sell our first molecular information products,
	FoundationOne for solid tumors, FoundationOne Heme for blood-based cancers, or hematologic malignancies, and FoundationACT, our blood-based (liquid biopsy) assay to measure ctDNA, which we plan to launch commercially to ordering physicians in March
	2016, to physicians in clinical practice, to continue to expand our current relationships and develop new relationships with biopharmaceutical partners, and to develop and commercialize new molecular information products. The demand for our existing
	products may decrease or may not continue to increase at historical rates for a number of reasons, including among others increased competition from companies that offer similar molecular diagnostic tests. In addition, FoundationOne and
	FoundationOne Heme have coverage decisions from only a few commercial third-party payors and do not have coverage contracts with or coverage decisions from most commercial third-party payors or any government payors, including Medicare.
	FoundationACT does not yet have coverage contracts with or coverage decisions from any commercial third-party payors or any government payors. Certain commercial third-party payors have declined to reimburse FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme
	because they have designated our products as experimental and investigational. This designation is customarily assigned to a product or service by a third-party payor pending the development of clinical information deemed sufficient to support a
	positive coverage decision. During this assessment period our products do not have the benefit of a positive coverage decision or a coverage contract from these third-party payors, resulting, in the aggregate, in a material loss of revenue to us. We
	have experienced revenue growth from the sale of each of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme to physicians since their formal commercial launches in June 2012 and December 2013, respectively. We may not be able to continue revenue growth or
	maintain existing revenue levels for a number of reasons, including because increased competition and lack of positive coverage decisions or coverage contracts from government or third-party payors may make it less likely that physicians will order
	our products.

	Our biopharmaceutical partners may decide to decrease or discontinue their use of our molecular information

	circumstances outside of our control. In addition, biopharmaceutical companies may decline to do business with us or decrease or discontinue their use of our molecular information platform due to our broad strategic collaboration with certain
	affiliates of Roche and the fact that Roche is our largest stockholder and beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding stock. In addition to reducing our revenue, if our biopharmaceutical partners decide to decrease or discontinue their use of
	our molecular information platform, this may reduce our exposure to early stage research that facilitates the incorporation of newly developed information about cancer into our molecular information platform and products.

	Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Array BioPharma Inc., AstraZeneca UK Limited, Celgene Corporation, Clovis Oncology, Eisai Co., Ltd., Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, and Novartis, among others, as well as our broad collaboration with Roche which closed in April
	2015. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, our alliance with Novartis accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, our broad collaboration with Roche accounted for more than 10% of our
	total revenue. We expect that our broad collaboration with Roche will account for a material portion of our revenue in future years. The revenue attributable to Novartis or Roche may fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our
	financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the termination of either of these relationships could result in a temporary or permanent loss of revenue to us.

	Our success in the future depends in part on our ability to maintain these relationships and to enter into new relationships. This can be difficult due to several factors, including internal and external
	constraints placed on these organizations that can limit the number and type of relationships with companies like us that can be considered and consummated; the agreements governing our relationships are generally terminable at will by our
	biopharmaceutical customers; our biopharmaceutical customers may be dissatisfied with our products; and continued usage of our products among particular biopharmaceutical customers may depend on whether the partner obtains positive data in its
	clinical trials or other administrative factors that are outside our control. Additionally, some of our biopharmaceutical partners have contracted with us to provide testing for large numbers of samples, which could strain our testing capacity and
	restrict our ability to perform additional tests for other customers. If we fail to maintain these relationships, or enter into new ones, our business could suffer.

	In both domestic and many international markets, sales of our existing and any future products we develop will depend, in large part, upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. These
	third-party payors include government healthcare programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, accountable care organizations, private health insurers, and other organizations. In particular, we believe that obtaining a positive national
	coverage decision and favorable reimbursement rate from CMS, for each of our existing products will be a necessary element in achieving material commercial success. Physicians and patients may not order our products unless commercial third-party
	payors and government payors authorize such ordering and pay for all, or a substantial portion, of the list price, and certain commercial third-party payors may not agree to reimburse our existing products if CMS or our local MAC, does not issue a
	positive coverage decision.

	There is currently no national coverage decision that determines whether and how our products are
	covered by Medicare. In the absence of a national coverage determination, local MACs that administer the Medicare program in various regions have some discretion in determining coverage and, therefore, payment for tests. At the time FoundationOne
	was launched in 2012, our local MAC, National Government Services, initially requested that we not submit claims for services provided to Medicare patients while the MAC assessed the appropriate coding, coverage, and payment for FoundationOne as a
	whole. To accommodate this request, we deferred the submission of claims until November 2013, when we commenced the process of submitting claims to National Government Services for FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme tests for Medicare patients
	with dates of service on or after November&nbsp;1, 2013.

	We are submitting claims to National Government Services using a
	miscellaneous CPT code. When submitting claims for services or procedures that do not have specific CPT codes, providers may submit those claims using a CPT code, referred to as the miscellaneous CPT code, to provide the means of reporting and
	tracking services and procedures until a more specific CPT code is established. We are not submitting claims to National Government Services using stacked CPT codes in the manner currently used in submitting claims to commercial third-party payors.
	The use of a miscellaneous CPT code for claims submitted to CMS may decrease the likelihood of reimbursement given that a miscellaneous CPT code is a single CPT code that does not represent an identified service or procedure. We have not received
	any correctly processed payments for FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, or FoundationACT provided to patients covered by Medicare to date. If CMS does not issue a positive national coverage determination, or National Government Services does not
	issue a local coverage determination, with respect to one or more of these products or if National Government Services denies reimbursement of one or more of these products, withdraws its coverage policies after reimbursement is obtained, reviews
	and adjusts the rate of reimbursement, or stops paying for one or more of these products altogether, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected both because we will not receive revenue for tests performed but also because
	physicians may be less likely to order a test for a patient if the test is not subject to a coverage determination such that the patient could ultimately be responsible for all or substantially all of the cost of the test.

	Commercial third-party payors and government payors are increasingly

	As a result, there is significant uncertainty
	surrounding whether the use of products that incorporate new technology, such as FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, and FoundationACT, will be eligible for coverage by commercial third-party payors and government payors or, if eligible for coverage,
	what the reimbursement rates will be for these products. The fact that a diagnostic product has been approved for reimbursement in the past, for any particular indication or in any particular jurisdiction, does not guarantee that such diagnostic
	product will remain approved for reimbursement or that similar or additional diagnostic products will be approved in the future. We have had claims for reimbursement denied by certain commercial third-party payors, in some cases because they have
	designated FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme as experimental and investigational. In addition, in March 2015, Palmetto, a MAC, published a final local coverage determination effective July&nbsp;6, 2015 outlining guidelines for coverage of
	well-validated comprehensive genomic profiles for certain patients diagnosed with NSCLC. The Palmetto website lists FoundationOne as a covered test under these guidelines. Our local MAC, National Government Services, has elected not to follow these
	guidelines from Palmetto and instead issued their own LCD for patients with NSCLC, which will be effective April&nbsp;1, 2016. This LCD provides coverage for hotspot panel tests of between 5 and 50 genes, and therefore does not provide coverage for
	our comprehensive genomic profiling products. Reimbursement of NGS-based cancer tests by commercial third-party payors and government payors may depend on a number of factors, including a payor&#146;s determination that our existing and future

	The FDA does not currently regulate most laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, such as FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, and

	intends to change this policy. The FDA previously announced in June 2010 that it intended to no longer exercise enforcement discretion for LDTs and subsequently stated that it would publish guidance documents describing an approach to regulating
	LDTs. In October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents that, if finalized, would implement a regulatory approach for most LDTs. In the draft guidance documents, the FDA stated that it had serious concerns regarding the lack of
	independent review of the evidence of clinical validity of LDTs and asserted that the requirements under CLIA, do not address the clinical validity of any LDT. If published and finalized in the same form, the guidance documents would impose a

	laboratory or the FDA&#146;s device registration and listing requirements, and (ii)&nbsp;the medical device reporting requirements for LDTs offered by that laboratory. The FDA&#146;s premarket review requirements would begin twelve months after
	finalization of the guidance documents for the highest risk tests, including LDTs with the same intended use as a companion diagnostic or LDTs with the same intended use as an FDA-approved Class III medical device. Premarket review would begin
	immediately for newly developed LDTs in this highest-risk group. Premarket review for other LDTs classified as high-risk by the FDA would be phased in over the next four years and the FDA expects to announce the priority list for premarket review
	for the remaining Class III LDTs within 24 months from finalization of this guidance. The FDA identified certain tests as higher risk, including LDTs that act like companion diagnostics, LDTs that screen for serious diseases or conditions for use in
	asymptomatic patients with no other available confirmatory diagnostic product

	On April&nbsp;1, 2013, cuts to the federal budget were implemented, requiring a 2% cut in Medicare payments for all services, including
	clinical laboratory testing. In December 2013, Congress extended this 2% cut for an additional two years until 2023. Many CPT procedure codes that we use to bill our products were revised by the AMA, effective January&nbsp;1, 2013. These new CPT
	codes were developed and implemented for individual genes, or the components of a multi-gene panel. In the Final Rule for 2013, CMS announced that it decided to keep the new molecular codes on the CLFS rather than move them to the Physician Fee
	Schedule. CMS then announced that for 2013, it would price the new codes using a &#147;gap filling&#148; process. Under this approach, CMS referred the CPT codes to the MACs to allow them to determine an appropriate price. CMS then calculated the
	median of the pricing provided by the MACs to establish and publish a National Limit Amount, or NLA, by CPT code for 2014.

	In
	2014, the AMA approved and implemented new CPT codes for genomic sequencing-based panel tests, effective January&nbsp;1, 2015. In 2015, CMS used a &#147;gap filling&#148; process to price some of these new codes, which included referring the new
	codes to the MACs to allow them to determine and submit to CMS an appropriate price if they deemed a code to be a covered service. CMS then established and published for 2016 an NLA for these codes as calculated by determining the median price as
	provided by the MACs for the applicable code. If CMS reduces reimbursement for the new CPT codes for individual genes or fails to price new multi-gene panel codes which cover our products, or if commercial payors who often base pricing on Medicare
	fee schedules reduce non-contracted payment rates below the new NLA amount for CPT codes corresponding to individual genes, mandate use of the new sequencing-based panel CPT codes, or decide to stop payment on specific CPT codes altogether, our
	revenue could be adversely affected.

	Additionally, in April 2014 the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or the Act,
	was enacted into law which reforms the Medicare payment system for clinical laboratory tests paid through the CLFS. The Act rescinds CMS statutory authority to make adjustments to future payments for tests based on &#147;technological changes,&#148;
	which CMS had intended to apply to certain test codes on the CLFS beginning in calendar year 2015. Beginning in January 2017, Medicare payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests will be established by a market-based payment system. Under this

	starting in 2017 could be adversely affected depending upon if and how payors adopt this new CMS pricing methodology and resulting rates. However, CMS has not published the Final Rules describing how the Act will be implemented, and as a result, the

	Two cases involving diagnostic method claims and &#147;gene patents&#148; have recently been decided by the Supreme Court. On March&nbsp;20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in&nbsp;
<I>
	Mayo
	Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories
</I>
	, or
<I>
	Prometheus

	, a case involving patent claims directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a specific patient. According to that decision, Prometheus&#146; claims failed to
	incorporate sufficient inventive content above and beyond mere underlying natural correlations to allow the claimed processes to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws. On June&nbsp;13, 2013, the Supreme Court subsequently
	decided
<I>
	Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics
</I>
	, or
<I>
	Myriad
</I>
	, a case brought by multiple plaintiffs challenging the validity of patent claims held by Myriad Genetics, Inc. relating to the breast cancer susceptibility genes
	BRCA1 and BRCA2, holding that isolated genomic DNA that exists in nature, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is not patentable subject matter, but that cDNA, which is an artificial construct created from RNA transcripts of

	On December&nbsp;16, 2014, the USPTO issued interim guidance, entitled &#147;2014 Interim
	Guidance on Patent Subject Matter Eligibility,&#148; which is for use by USPTO personnel in examining patent claims reciting judicially recognized exceptions to patentable subject matter, including laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract

<I>
	Prometheus

	exception to patent-eligible subject matter must amount to significantly more than the judicial exception itself in order to be patent-eligible subject matter. We cannot assure you that our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and
	products will not be negatively impacted by this interim guidance issued by the USPTO, the decisions described above, rulings in other cases, or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.

<I>

	interim guidance described above, the contours of when claims reciting laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas may meet the patent eligibility requirements are not clear and may take years to develop via interpretation at the USPTO and
	in the courts. There are many previously issued patents claiming nucleic acids and diagnostic methods based on natural correlations that issued before the recent Supreme Court decisions discussed, and although many of these patents may be invalid
	under the standards set forth in the Supreme Court&#146;s recent decisions, until successfully challenged, these patents are presumed valid and enforceable, and certain third parties could allege that we infringe, or request that we obtain a license
	to, these patents. Whether based on patents issued prior to or after these Supreme Court decisions, we could have to defend ourselves against claims of patent infringement, or choose to license rights, if available, under patents claiming such
	methods. In particular, although the Supreme Court has held in
<I>
	Myriad

	that isolated genomic DNA is not patent-eligible subject matter, certain third parties could allege that activities that we may undertake infringe other classes of
	gene-related patent claims, and we could have to defend ourselves against these claims by asserting non-infringement and/or invalidity positions, or pay to obtain a license to these claims. In any of the foregoing or in other situations involving
	third-party intellectual property rights, if we are unsuccessful in defending against claims of patent infringement, we could be forced to pay damages or be subjected to an injunction that would prevent us from utilizing the patented subject matter

	In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of

	are disputed during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed new and untested regulations and

	In addition to patent protection, we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and

	The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual
	property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries,
	particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to biotechnology. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if
	obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the
	enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which
	is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.

	Third parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. For example, we rely on certain third parties to provide us with tissue samples and
	biological materials that we use to conduct our genomic analyses. We have written agreements with collaborators that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. These agreements provide that we must negotiate
	certain commercial rights with collaborators with respect to joint inventions or inventions made by our collaborators that arise from the results of the collaboration. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address
	clearly the resolution of intellectual property rights that may arise from a collaboration. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party
	collaborator&#146;s materials where required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a collaborator&#146;s samples, we may be limited in our ability to capitalize on the market potential of
	these inventions. In addition, we may face claims that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective, or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations
	of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an
	ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property, or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could have an adverse impact on our business.

	forth in the Investor Rights Agreement, subject to the prior consent of Roche. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also could provide for rights, preferences, or
	privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, those debt securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt
	securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our
	platform technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.

	The credit markets and the
	financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse, or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United
	States federal government. Accordingly, additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we cannot secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or
	more research and development programs or sales and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.

	As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting,
	and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC, and the NASDAQ Stock
	Market, or NASDAQ. The SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
	Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas.
	Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs
	and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting
	obligations, and as a result of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations, and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act, and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in the future, we will
	likely need to devote additional time and costs to comply with such compliance programs and rules. These rules and regulations will cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming

	To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, including
	implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are
	continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
	within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Our current controls and any
	new controls that we develop may become inadequate, and weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic
	management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which we may be required to include in our periodic reports we file
	with the SEC under Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. In the event that we are
	not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in
	our operating results, and the price of our common stock could decline.

	control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. During

	These and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or
	prevent investors from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and NASDAQ and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have
	experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have
	instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and

	of the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise

	stock sold by us pursuant to the full exercise of an overallotment option granted to the underwriters) at a price of $18.00 per share, before underwriting discounts. The offer and sale of the shares in our IPO was registered under the Securities Act
	pursuant to registration statements on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-190226), which was filed with the SEC on July&nbsp;29, 2013 and amended subsequently and declared effective by the SEC on September&nbsp;24, 2013, and Form S-1MEF (File
	No.&nbsp;333-191333), which was filed with the SEC on September&nbsp;24, 2013 and automatically effective upon filing. Following the sale of the shares in connection with the closing of our IPO, the offering terminated. The offering did not
	terminate before all the securities registered in the registration statements were sold. Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&amp; Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as joint book-running managers of the offering, and Leerink Swann LLC and Sanford C.

	We are a molecular information company focused on fundamentally changing the way in which patients with cancer are
	evaluated and treated. We believe an information-based approach to making clinical treatment decisions based on comprehensive genomic profiling will become a standard of care for patients with cancer. We derive revenue from selling products that are
	enabled by our molecular information platform to physicians and biopharmaceutical companies. Our platform includes proprietary methods and algorithms for analyzing specimens across all types of cancer, and for incorporating that information into
	clinical care in a concise and user-friendly fashion. Our products provide genomic information about each patient&#146;s individual cancer, enabling physicians to optimize treatments in clinical practice and biopharmaceutical companies to develop
	targeted oncology therapies more effectively. We believe we have a significant first mover advantage in providing comprehensive genomic profiling and molecular information products on a commercial scale.

	Our flagship clinical molecular information products, FoundationOne for solid tumors and FoundationOne Heme for blood-based cancers, or
	hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and advanced sarcomas, are, to our knowledge, the only widely available comprehensive genomic profiles designed for use in the routine care of patients with cancer. To accelerate our
	commercial growth and enhance our competitive advantage, we are continuing to develop and commercialize new molecular information products for physicians and biopharmaceutical companies, strengthen our commercial organization, introduce new
	marketing, education and provider engagement efforts, grow our molecular information knowledgebase, called FoundationCORE, aggressively pursue reimbursement from regional and national third-party payors and government payors, publish scientific and
	medical advances, and foster relationships across the oncology community. We believe our molecular information products address a market opportunity of $12-15 billion.

	The cancer treatment paradigm is evolving rapidly, and we believe there is now widespread recognition that cancer is a disease of the genome, rather than a disease defined solely by its specific
	anatomical location in the body. Today, physicians increasingly use precision medicines to target cancers based on the specific genomic alterations driving their growth. We believe physicians need molecular information about their patients&#146;
	unique cancers to determine the optimal course of treatment.

	Since our inception in 2009, we have devoted substantially all
	of our resources to the development of our molecular information platform, the commercialization of FoundationOne, and the development of new products such as FoundationOne Heme and FoundationACT. We have incurred significant losses since our
	inception, and as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 our accumulated deficit was approximately $231.6 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses over the near term as we expand our commercial operations, conduct clinical trials, and invest in
	our molecular information platform and additional products, including the anticipated commercial launch of FoundationACT in March 2016.

	In January 2016, we announced a three-way collaboration with Horizon Healthcare Services, New Jersey&#146;s oldest and largest health
	insurer, and COTA to advance precision medicine, improve clinical outcomes, and deliver enhanced value to the healthcare system in the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Together, the organizations initiated a prospective clinical study
	measuring changes in survival benefit and total cost savings achieved among patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC who undergo comprehensive genomic profiling with FoundationOne versus another assay. The study is designed to enable
	Horizon Healthcare Services to provide its members with coverage for FoundationOne as a critical component clinical care pathway in the evaluation of patients with metastatic lung cancer.

	physicians in March 2016. We believe FoundationACT will become an important molecular information solution for oncologists because it will provide a new option for comprehensive genomic profiling when tissue biopsy is not feasible. By analyzing
	cell-free DNA isolated from a patient&#146;s blood, we can identify clinically relevant genomic alterations in the cell-free DNA that is ctDNA and match these alterations to targeted therapies and clinical trials.

	For many physician orders within the United States, the payment we ultimately receive depends upon the rate of reimbursement from
	commercial third-party payors and government payors. We are not currently a participating provider with most commercial third-party payors and, therefore, do not have specific coverage decisions from those third-party payors for our products with
	established payment rates. Currently, most of the commercial third-party payors that reimburse our claims do so based upon the stacked CPT codes, the predominant methodology, or based on other methods such as percentages of charges or other formulas
	that are not made known to us. In addition, a small portion of commercial third-party payors outsource our claims to preferred provider organizations or third-party administrators, who process our claims and pay us directly at negotiated rates.
	Coverage and payment is determined by each third-party payor on a case-by-case basis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we were not a participating provider in any state Medicaid program, and, therefore did not have coverage decisions under which our
	tests were covered by these Medicaid programs. We are a participating provider in the Medicare program, but we do not have a coverage decision within our jurisdiction. At the end of 2013, we began the process of submitting claims for our tests to
	Medicare. We may also negotiate rates with patients, if the patient is responsible for payment. Our efforts in obtaining reimbursement based on individual claims, including pursuing appeals or reconsiderations of claim denials, take a substantial
	amount of time, and bills may not be paid for many months or at all. Furthermore, if a third-party payor denies coverage after final appeal, payment may not be received at all.

	history of collecting claims. We expect to use judgment in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable and whether collectability is reasonably assured as we continue to gain payment
	experience with third-party payors and patients. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as tests are processed. These costs are recorded regardless of when or whether revenue is recognized with respect to those tests. Because we
	currently recognize revenue on a cash basis from commercial third-party payors, the costs of those tests are recognized in advance of any associated revenues. Our revenue from these payors is generally lower and our net loss is higher than if we
	were recognizing revenue from these payors on an accrual basis in the period during which the work was performed and costs were incurred.

	There are currently no national or local coverage determinations in our region that determine whether and how our tests are covered by Medicare. In the absence of national coverage decisions, local MACs
	that administer the Medicare program in various regions have some discretion in determining coverage and, therefore, payment for tests. For example, while one leading MAC covering another region issued a decision to cover well-validated
	comprehensive genomic profiles for a subset of NSCLC patients effective July 2015, our local MAC has not yet elected to follow the same standards for determining coverage at this time. Our local MAC, who would process our claims on behalf of
	Medicare, initially requested that we not submit claims for FoundationOne tests provided to Medicare patients while the contractor assessed the appropriate coverage and payment for FoundationOne as a whole. Based on the volume of our Medicare
	claims, we began the process of submitting claims to Medicare in November 2013, but we have not generated any revenue from Medicare for our tests to date. As a result, our net loss is higher than if we were recognizing revenue from the sale of our
	tests for patients covered by Medicare. FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme tests for patients covered by Medicare represented approximately 31%, 31%, and 30% of total tests reported to physicians in the United States during the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

	At the end of 2013, we commenced the process of submitting claims to
	Medicare for FoundationOne tests provided to Medicare patients, and subsequently during the first quarter of 2014 we commenced the process of submitting claims to Medicare for FoundationOne Heme tests provided to Medicare patients. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, our MAC has not correctly processed and reimbursed us for any of the claims that we have submitted, and we are in the process of appealing these unpaid claims. In the future, our MAC may issue a negative coverage
	determination for one or more of our tests that would apply to future claims or may defer processing a claim pending a coverage or payment determination. If a claim is paid by our MAC, either upon acceptance of the claim or following a successful
	appeal of a denied claim, we will generate revenue from Medicare for our testing. In February 2016, National Government Services announced a final LCD, effective April&nbsp;1, 2016, which includes reimbursement for hotspot tests of 5 to 50 genes for
	patients with metastatic NSCLC. We do not believe this LCD reflects coverage for our validated comprehensive genomic profiling products, and we will continue to seek a positive coverage determination from our MAC, which, if obtained, will establish
	a standard for the reimbursement of our Medicare claims.

<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">
	We expect that our current lack of significant coverage decisions
	and the general uncertainty around reimbursement for our tests will continue to negatively impact our revenue and earnings, both because we will not recognize revenue for tests performed, particularly if our test volumes increase period-to-period,
	and because the absence of Medicare or other significant coverage decisions may lead physicians to not order a meaningful number of tests. Following our achievement of a coverage decision from a commercial third-party payor or a government payor or
	once we have a sufficient history of claims collections with any such payor that we conclude the fees for our tests for individuals insured by such payor are sufficiently fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, we will begin
	to recognize revenue from such payor on an accrual basis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of approximately $232.3 million. If we are not able to obtain coverage decisions from additional
	commercial third-party payors and government payors over the longer term, and our available cash and marketable security balances and cash flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may require additional
	capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may be subject to the prior consent of Roche pursuant to our Investor Rights Agreement.

	Certain of our arrangements include multiple deliverables. We analyze multiple-element arrangements
	based on the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605-25,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements
</I>
	, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate
	multiple-element arrangements to determine (1)&nbsp;the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2)&nbsp;whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of
	accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship.
	Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i)&nbsp;the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii)&nbsp;if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items
	and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, development and commercialization capabilities
	of a third party and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the other party in the arrangement can use the other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the
	remaining elements, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered items, and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered elements.

<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">
	Arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. Then, the applicable revenue recognition criteria in
	ASC 605-25 is applied to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25.
	Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not
	available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price, since we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting under
	multiple-element arrangements. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units
	of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting. We recognize arrangement consideration
	allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting.

	that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone
	satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Generally, once a substantive milestone has been achieved, we will recognize revenue related to that milestone using a proportional performance model over the period
	which the unit of accounting is delivered or based on the level of effort expended to date over the total expected effort, whichever is considered the most appropriate measure of performance. Revenue from commercial milestone payments are accounted
	for as royalties and recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

	For some multiple-element arrangements, we

	expected effort, whichever is considered the most appropriate measure of performance.

	We expect our revenue to increase over
	time as we expand our commercial efforts within the United States, and outside the United States pursuant to our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement with Roche. Positive reimbursement decisions from additional commercial third-party payors and
	government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, would eliminate much of the uncertainty around payment and could allow us to recognize revenue earlier and potentially increase our overall revenue growth and test volume growth from ordering
	physicians within the United States. We also expect to grow our biopharmaceutical customer base. Over time, we expect that our revenue from ordering physicians within and outside of the United States will exceed revenue from our biopharmaceutical
	customers, given the higher percentage of patients with cancer who are treated outside of clinical trial settings.

	Cost of revenue consists of personnel expenses, including

	Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as tests are processed. These costs are recorded regardless of whether revenue is
	recognized with respect to those tests. Because we currently recognize revenue on a cash basis from commercial third-party payors and patients who make co-payments, pay deductibles or pay other amounts that we have been unable to collect from their
	insurers, the costs of those tests are often recognized in advance of any associated revenues.

	Our average revenue per test excludes tests for which we have not yet recognized revenue. Because we recognize revenue on a
	cash basis from commercial third-party payors and from patients who make co-payments, pay deductibles, or pay other amounts that we have been unable to collect from their third-party payors because the payment is not fixed or determinable and
	collectability is not reasonably assured, and our efforts to obtain payment for individual claims can take a substantial amount of time, there is typically a significant lag between the time the test is reported and the time we actually recognize
	the revenue from such test. As a result, if we were to include tests for which we have not recognized revenue in our average revenue per test calculation for a particular period, it would imply that we will not receive any revenue for such tests.
	Despite our lack of coverage decisions, we have been reasonably successful in securing reimbursement from many commercial third-party payors for tests reported in prior periods. With respect to tests reported for patients covered by Medicare, we
	commenced the process of submitting claims to Medicare for these tests in November 2013 and have not yet been reimbursed based on properly processed submissions for these claims. We also expect to record revenue from patients who make co-payments,
	pay deductibles, or pay other amounts that we have been unable to collect from third-party payors. While receipt of payment from third-party payors and patients in respect of these claims is not currently fixed or determinable and collectability is
	not reasonably assured, we do expect to record revenue in the future for some of the tests reported in this period. However, it is difficult to predict future revenue from the previously reported tests because we are in an early stage of
	commercialization and we have limited payment history. As a result, we cannot be certain that the revenue per test we recognize in the future will remain consistent with the average revenue per test reported above.

	will recognize revenue for such tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. Any revenue that we receive in respect of these previously reported tests will favorably impact our liquidity and results of operations in future

	This increase was driven by increasing test volumes from our ordering physicians and biopharmaceutical customers. The average cost per test does not differ materially by customer. Additional volume led to higher reagent and consumable costs,
	additional laboratory personnel-related costs, facilities costs, and higher depreciation expense related to new equipment purchases. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, our total cost of revenue represented approximately 42.3%

	Our average revenue per test excludes tests for which we have not yet recognized revenue.
	Because we recognize revenue on a cash basis from commercial third-party payors and from patients who make co-payments, and our efforts to obtain payment for individual claims can take a substantial amount of time, there is typically a significant
	lag between the time the test is reported and the time we actually recognize the revenue from such test. As a result, if we were to include tests for which we have not recognized revenue in our average revenue per test calculation for a particular
	period, it would imply that we will not receive any revenue for such tests. Despite our lack of coverage decisions, we have been reasonably successful in securing reimbursement from many commercial third-party payors for tests reported in prior
	periods. With respect to tests reported for patients covered by Medicare, we commenced the process of submitting claims to Medicare for these tests in November 2013 and have not yet been reimbursed based on properly processed submissions for these
	claims. We also expect to record revenue from patients who make co-payments, pay deductibles, or pay other amounts that we have been unable to collect from third-party payors. While receipt of payment from third-party payors and patients in respect
	of these claims is not currently fixed or determinable and collectability is not reasonably assured, we do expect to record revenue in the future for some of the tests reported in this period. However, it is difficult to predict future revenue from
	the previously reported FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme tests because we are in an early stage of commercialization and do not yet have broad coverage decisions. As a result, we cannot be certain that the revenue per test we recognize in the
	future will remain consistent with the average revenue per test reported above.

	The cumulative amount of FoundationOne and
	FoundationOne Heme tests that have been billed to commercial third-party payors and reported for patients covered by Medicare but for which we have not recognized revenue was 10,471 and 8,844, respectively, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. If
	commercial third-party payors or government payors agree to pay us for these tests in the future, we will recognize revenue for such tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. Any revenue that we receive in respect of
	these previously reported tests will favorably impact our liquidity and results of operations in future periods.

	For our
	biopharmaceutical customer revenue that was based on a negotiated price per test, the average revenue per test was approximately $3,300 and $3,700 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This decrease in average revenue
	per test was due in part to several large projects that included certain volume-based discounts. We expect our average revenue per test for biopharmaceutical customers to remain fairly consistent going forward. Approximately $11.6&nbsp;million and
	$8.9 million of our biopharmaceutical revenue for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, represented payments under contracts with multiple-element arrangements that were not negotiated on a price per test basis.

	Cost of
	revenue increased to $27.4 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 from $11.7 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. This increase was driven by increasing test volumes from our ordering physicians and biopharmaceutical
	customers. The average cost per test does not differ materially by customer. Additional volume led to higher reagent and consumable costs, additional laboratory personnel-related costs, and higher depreciation expense related to new equipment
	purchases. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, our cost of revenue represented approximately 44.9% and 40.2%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect to make additional investments in personnel, infrastructure, and systems
	to scale our laboratory operations to meet future anticipated demand.

	We expect to incur additional operating losses in the near future and our operating expenses will increase as we
	continue to expand our sales force, increase our marketing efforts to drive market adoption of FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, and FoundationACT, invest in clinical trials, innovate our molecular information platform, and develop new product
	offerings. Our liquidity requirements have and will continue to consist of selling and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, capital expenditures, expenses incurred fulfilling our obligations under the Ex-U.S. Commercialization
	Agreement with Roche, working capital, and general corporate expenses. If demand for our products continues to increase, we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements will also increase in order to build additional capacity. We expect that
	our planned expenditures will be funded from our ongoing operations and from our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

	In April 2015, the Roche transaction was consummated and we received $250.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock to Roche at a price of $50.00 per share. Based
	on our current business plan, we believe our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements over the next 12
	months. We may consider raising additional capital to pursue strategic investments or for other reasons, subject to certain consent rights of Roche contained in the Investor Rights Agreement. In the future, we expect our operating and capital
	expenditures to increase as we increase our headcount, expand our selling and marketing activities and continue to invest in new product offerings.

	If our available cash, cash equivalent, and marketable securities balances and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of lower
	demand for our products, lower than currently expected rates of reimbursement from commercial third-party payors and government payors, increased competition from other providers of molecular diagnostic tests, or other risks described in this Annual
	Report on Form 10-K, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt financing. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities
	may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, convertible debt securities or other debt financing, these securities
	or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations, and certain of these transactions will be subject to the prior consent of Roche as set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement. Any other third-party funding arrangement could
	require us to relinquish valuable rights. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.

	We had deferred tax assets of approximately $99.0&nbsp;million and deferred tax liabilities of $6.9&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,

	We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the consolidated financial
	statements, as well as revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are
	reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from

	We currently derive revenue from selling products that are enabled by our molecular information platform. We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of
	the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. We receive payments from: commercial third-party payors; certain
	hospitals and cancer centers with which we have direct bill relationships; individual patients; and our biopharmaceutical customers.

	We currently recognize revenue on a cash basis for sales of our products for which we receive payments from commercial third-party payors and patients who make co-payments, pay deductibles or other
	amounts that we have been unable to collect from their third-party payors since the fee is not fixed or determinable and collectability is not reasonably assured. Our products are delivered electronically and, as such, there are no shipping and
	handling fees incurred by us or billed to our customers. We believe our products are exempt from state sales taxation due to the nature of our products. As a result, we do not charge our customers state sales tax. Because we have limited payment
	experience with third-party payors and patients, we have not concluded that the fee is fixed or determinable or that collectability is reasonably assured, and therefore, we recognize revenue on a cash basis. We expect to use judgment in our
	assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable and whether collectability is reasonably assured in determining when to recognize revenue in the future as we continue to gain payment experience with third-party payors and patients.

	Our arrangements with biopharmaceutical customers are based on a negotiated price per test
	or on the basis of agreements to provide certain testing volumes or other deliverables over defined periods. We recognize revenue upon delivery of the test results, or over the period that testing volume or other deliverables are provided, as
	appropriate, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized

	Certain of our arrangements include multiple deliverables. We analyze multiple-element
	arrangements based on the guidance in ASC&nbsp;605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (1)&nbsp;the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2)&nbsp;whether the individual
	deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and
	whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that: (i)&nbsp;the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and
	(ii)&nbsp;if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone
	value, we consider factors such as the research, development and commercialization capabilities of a third party and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the other party in the
	arrangement can use the other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered items and whether there are other vendors that can provide the
	undelivered elements.

	Arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of
	accounting using the relative selling price method. Then, the applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 is applied to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine
	the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using VSOE of selling price, if available,
	TPE of selling price if VSOE is not available, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price, since we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting under
	multiple-element arrangements. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units
	of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting. We recognize arrangement consideration
	allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting.

	At the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone.
	This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (i)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome resulting
	from our performance to achieve the milestone, (ii)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance and (iii)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate
	factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment.
	There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Generally, once a substantive milestone has been achieved, we will recognize revenue
	related to that milestone using a proportional performance model over the period which the unit of accounting is delivered or based on the level of effort

	We utilized various valuation methodologies in accordance with the framework of the 2004 American Institute of Certified Public
	Accountants Technical Practice Aid, or Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, to estimate the fair value of our common stock. Our Board estimated our enterprise value as of the various valuation
	dates using a market approach and an income approach, which are acceptable valuation methods in accordance with the Practice Aid. Under the market approach, enterprise value can be estimated by evaluating recent arm&#146;s length transactions
	involving the sale of our preferred stock to investors and by comparisons to similar publicly traded companies. Under the income approach, enterprise value can be estimated using the discounted cash flow method. Additionally, each valuation reflects
	a marketability discount, resulting from the illiquidity of our common stock. We performed these contemporaneous valuations as of August&nbsp;31, 2011,&nbsp;November&nbsp;5, 2012, February&nbsp;15, 2013, and May&nbsp;10, 2013.

	The fair value method for stock option awards requires us to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards to employees and non-employees on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
	The fair value is then recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period, of the award. Stock-based awards granted to non-employees are subject to
	periodic revaluation over their vesting term.

	We determine the expected term of stock options according to the &#147;simplified&#148; method. Under this method, the expected term is
	calculated as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the stock option. The assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation that we will not pay dividends in the foreseeable future, which is consistent with our history of
	not paying dividends. We determine the risk-free interest rate by using the equivalent to the expected term based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect as of the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our
	estimates, as appropriate, but actual future forfeiture rates may differ. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our statements of operations and comprehensive loss could be materially
	impacted.

	We have also granted performance-based stock options with terms that allow the recipients to vest in a specific
	number of shares based upon the achievement of performance-based milestones as specified in the grants. Stock-based compensation expense associated with these performance-based stock options is recognized if the performance condition is considered
	probable of achievement using management&#146;s best estimates of the time to vesting for the achievement of the performance-based milestones. If the actual achievement of the performance-based milestones varies from our estimates, stock-based
	compensation expense could be materially different than what is recorded in the period. The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated time to vesting for performance-based stock options will be recognized as

	On April&nbsp;6, 2015, Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP, or Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young, resigned as our independent registered public accounting
	firm, and Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young&#146;s resignation was accepted and approved by the audit committee of the Board. Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young performs certain non-audit services for Roche and/or its affiliates, and, as such, determined that it may have
	ceased to qualify as being &#147;independent&#148; from us within the meaning of the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder following April&nbsp;7, 2015, when we closed our transaction with Roche. Ernst&nbsp;&amp;
	Young&#146;s reports on our financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope,
	or accounting principles. In addition, there were no disagreements between us and Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young on accounting principles, financial statements disclosures or audit scope, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young,
	would have caused them to make reference to the disagreement in their reports.

	On April&nbsp;6, 2015, the audit committee of
	the Board approved KPMG LLP, or KPMG, as our new independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. During the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and
	December&nbsp;31, 2014, and through the date of KPMG&#146;s appointment, we did not consult with KPMG with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion
	that might be rendered on our consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii)&nbsp;of Regulation S-K.

	Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and
	15d-15(e)) are designed only to provide reasonable assurance that they will meet their objectives. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
	conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation,
	our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is
	recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
	financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined
	in Exchange Act Rule 13a&#150;15(f) or 15d-15(d). Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and our Board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All
	internal control systems, no matter how well designed have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Our
	management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
	Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 (COSO criteria). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. This Annual
	Report on Form&nbsp;10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies.

	Foundation Medicine, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Foundation Medicine Securities Corporation (collectively, the
	&#147;Company&#148;), is a molecular information company focused on fundamentally changing the way in which patients with cancer are evaluated and treated. The Company believes an information-based approach to making clinical treatment decisions
	based on comprehensive genomic profiling will become a standard of care for patients with cancer. The Company derives revenue from selling products that are enabled by its molecular information platform to physicians and biopharmaceutical companies.

	The Company&#146;s flagship clinical molecular information products, FoundationOne for solid tumors and FoundationOne Heme for
	blood-based cancers, or hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and advanced sarcomas, are, to its knowledge, the only widely available comprehensive genomic profiles designed for use in the routine care of patients with
	cancer. To accelerate its commercial growth and enhance its competitive advantage, the Company is continuing to develop and commercialize new molecular information products for physicians and biopharmaceutical companies, strengthen its commercial
	organization, introduce new marketing, education and provider engagement efforts, grow its molecular information knowledgebase, called FoundationCORE, aggressively pursue reimbursement from regional and national third-party payors, publish
	scientific and medical advances, and foster relationships throughout the oncology community. Examples of new products include GeneKit, a cloud-based genomics solutions portal for pathologists and FoundationACT, a blood-based (liquid biopsy) assay to
	measure circulating tumor DNA (&#147;ctDNA&#148;). The Company launched FoundationACT for research use to its biopharmaceutical partners in December 2015 and anticipates a commercial launch of this test to ordering physicians in March 2016.

	The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December&nbsp;31, 2015 will be sufficient to allow
	the Company to fund its current operating plan through at least January&nbsp;1, 2017. As the Company continues to incur losses, its transition to profitability is dependent upon a level of revenues adequate to support the Company&#146;s cost
	structure. If the Company&#146;s transition to profitability is not consistent with its current operating plan, the Company may have to seek additional capital.

	impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the book value of the assets exceeds their fair value, which is measured based on the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the assets. No impairment
	losses were recorded during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. In connection with the One Kendall Square lease termination, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $439,000 associated with fixed assets left at the facility during

<I>
	Revenue
	Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements
</I>
	(&#147;ASC 605-25&#148;). Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, the Company evaluates multiple-element arrangements to determine (1)&nbsp;the deliverables included in the arrangement and
	(2)&nbsp;whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments
	about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting if: (i)&nbsp;the delivered items have value to the
	customer on a standalone basis and (ii)&nbsp;the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the
	Company. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, the Company considers factors such as the research, development and commercialization capabilities of a third party and the availability of the associated expertise in the general
	marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the other party in the arrangement can use the other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on
	the undelivered items, and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered elements.

	the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. The Company determines the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, the Company determines the estimated selling price for
	units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (&#147;TPE&#148;) of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling
	price (&#147;BESP&#148;) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company typically uses BESP to estimate the selling price, since it generally does not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for its units of accounting under multiple-element

	At the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments to the Company, the Company evaluates whether each
	milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (i)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either the Company&#146;s performance to
	achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the Company&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (ii)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance,

	overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of
	the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. Generally, once a substantive milestone has been achieved, the Company will recognize revenue related to that milestone using a proportional performance model over the period which
	the unit of accounting is delivered or based on the level of effort expended to date over the total expected effort, whichever is considered the most appropriate measure of performance. Revenue from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as

	requires subjective assumptions, including (a)&nbsp;the expected stock price volatility, (b)&nbsp;the expected term of the award, (c)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate, and (d)&nbsp;expected dividends. Due to the lack of Company-specific historical
	and implied volatility data, the Company has based its estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of companies that are publicly traded. The Company selected a representative group of companies with
	comparable characteristics to it, including risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected term of the stock-based awards. The Company computes the historical volatility of
	this selected group using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient
	amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available. The Company estimates the expected life of its employee stock options using the &#147;simplified&#148; method, whereby, the expected life equals the
	arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to its lack of sufficient historical data. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury
	securities with a maturity date commensurate with the expected term of the associated award. The Company has never paid, and does not expect to pay, dividends in the foreseeable future; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero.

	61.3% of the outstanding shares. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, Roche&#146;s ownership was approximately 60.9% of the outstanding shares. Upon the closing of the transaction, the size of the Board of Directors of the Company (&#147;Board&#148;) was
	increased to nine, including three designees of Roche. Four existing independent directors and the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, Michael Pellini, M.D., have continued as directors, and the Company expects that one new independent director

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement by and among the Company, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., dated
	January&nbsp;11, 2015 (the &#147;R&amp;D Collaboration Agreement&#148;), Roche could pay the Company more than $150,000,000 over a period of five years to access its molecular information platform, to reserve capacity for sample profiling, and to
	fund R&amp;D programs. Amounts under the R&amp;D Collaboration Agreement will be received as services are performed and obligations are fulfilled under each platform program. Roche will utilize the Company&#146;s molecular information platform to
	standardize sample profiling conducted as part of its clinical trials, to enable comparability of clinical trial results for R&amp;D purposes, and to better understand the potential for combination therapies. In addition, Roche and the Company will
	jointly develop solutions related to cancer immunotherapy testing, blood-based genomic analysis using ctDNA assays, and next generation companion diagnostics, each of which represents a distinct platform within the R&amp;D Collaboration Agreement.
	The R&amp;D Collaboration Agreement is governed by a Joint Management Committee (&#147;JMC&#148;) formed by an equal number of representatives from the Company and Roche. There are also other sub-committees for each platform that will be established
	to oversee the day to day responsibilities of the respective platform. The JMC will, among other activities, review and approve R&amp;D plans and establish and set expectations for the other platform sub-committees. The JMC and other sub-committees,
	although considered deliverables under the arrangement, are immaterial in relation to the entire arrangement and therefore were not considered when allocating consideration.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company determined which deliverables within the arrangement have standalone value from the other undelivered elements, and identified the
	following separate units of accounting: (i)&nbsp;reserved capacity for sample profiling, (ii)&nbsp;access to the Company&#146;s molecular information database and FTEs per year for the performance of database queries and the delivery of results, and
	(iii)&nbsp;sample profiling above the reserved capacity limit. The cross-licenses grant each party access to relevant IP to perform under the contract or to exploit the deliverables. The licenses are delivered at the inception of the arrangement and
	relate to development and sample profiling work performed under the platform. The Company does not sell the licenses separately as they are closely connected to the development and sample profiling activities and have little value to Roche without
	these other deliverables. Therefore, the licenses are combined with the other units of accounting identified under the molecular information platform program and do not have standalone value.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company identified allocable consideration of approximately $85,000,000 related to the molecular information platform program, which was
	allocated to the individual units of accounting based on the BESP. Revenue related to reserved capacity for sample profiling will be recognized on a straight-line basis as the capacity is available for each individual contract year within the
	arrangement. The database access and FTE payments will be recognized ratably over the five year contract life. The FTEs will perform database queries and will deliver results of the requested database queries. The value to Roche is not only the
	access to the database, but also the service being performed by the FTEs. Therefore, the Company concluded the FTEs should be combined with the database access as one unit of accounting. For any sample profiling provided above the reserved capacity,
	the Company will recognize revenue as the service is provided based on the BESP.

	In November 2011, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (&#147;MSA&#148;) with a biopharmaceutical customer (the
	&#147;Customer&#148;) establishing the legal and administrative framework for collaboration. In May 2012, the Company and the Customer amended the MSA to include certain guaranteed quarterly minimum payments by the Customer in return for the Company
	providing sufficient laboratory capacity to perform up to a maximum number of tests. The amendment defined an initial two year term beginning on the amendment date, during which the Customer agreed to pay the Company $14,200,000. The Company and the
	Customer executed a second amendment to the MSA, which was effective in October 2013, and extended the term through at least September 2016 during which time the Customer agreed to pay the Company $17,100,000. The Company concluded that the second
	amendment represented a material modification to the arrangement

	pursuant to ASC 605. At the date of the modification, there was no deferred revenue balance on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company identified three deliverables under the amended
	agreement: (i)&nbsp;project management and Joint Steering Committee (&#147;JSC&#148;) services, (ii)&nbsp;the provision of molecular information developed by the Company upon the Customer&#146;s request, and (iii)&nbsp;the provision of sufficient
	laboratory capacity to test a minimum number of samples provided by the Customer. The Company determined that none of the deliverables under the amended agreement had standalone value since these services were not sold separately by any vendor,
	including the Company, and a customer could not resell these deliverables on a standalone basis. Thus, the Company determined the arrangement included a single unit of accounting, with revenue being recognized ratably over the three-year term of the
	amended MSA based on the passage of time, as there is no evidence to suggest revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Under the amended MSA, the Company recognized revenue of $6,968,000, $7,996,000, and $6,812,000 for
	the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

	In July 2015, the Company was notified by the Customer of its
	desire to discontinue the obligation for the Company to provide molecular information upon the Customer&#146;s request. These services were discontinued effective October&nbsp;1, 2015. All remaining deliverables under the amended MSA, as described

	In July 2012, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (&#147;Services Agreement&#148;) with a biopharmaceutical partner
	(&#147;Partner&#148;) to perform sample profiling at the Partner&#146;s request. The Services Agreement established the legal and administrative framework for the partnership between the entities. The Services Agreement also included a right for the
	Partner to initiate an exclusive negotiation with the Company for the development of a Companion Diagnostic (&#147;CDx&#148;). In March 2014, the Company and Partner expanded the scope of work by executing a Companion Diagnostic Agreement
	(&#147;Amended Agreement&#148;), thereby amending the Services Agreement to include the joint development and regulatory approval for a CDx. The Amended Agreement defined the term of the arrangement as the earlier of five years or receipt of certain
	regulatory approvals of a CDx. The Company concluded that the amendment to the original Services Agreement represented a material modification to the arrangement pursuant to ASC 605 as the Amended Agreement increased total consideration by a
	significant amount. Additionally, the deliverables under the Amended Agreement changed significantly. At the date of the modification, there was no deferred revenue balance on the consolidated balance sheet related to the original Services Agreement
	with this Partner.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company identified seven deliverables under the Amended Agreement: (i)&nbsp;cross-licenses for access to relevant
	IP, (ii)&nbsp;obligations to continue to perform sample profiling pursuant to the original Services Agreement, (iii)&nbsp;obligations to perform specific R&amp;D activities for the development of a CDx assay for use in connection with the
	Partner&#146;s product, (iv)&nbsp;obligations to assist in obtaining regulatory approval of the Partner&#146;s product at its request, (v)&nbsp;participation on a JSC to manage the overall development of the CDx assay, (vi) obligations to perform
	analytical validation of the CDx assay, and (vii) obligations to make the CDx assay commercially available, following any required regulatory approval. The obligation to make the CDx assay commercially available is dependent on successful
	development and regulatory approval. As such, the Company determined that this was a contingent deliverable and therefore arrangement consideration was not allocated to this deliverable.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company then determined the following deliverables were separate units of accounting: (i)&nbsp;obligations to continue to perform sample

	separately as they are closely connected to the R&amp;D development activities and have little value to the Partner without the performance of such activities. The JSC obligations do not have standalone value and are also closely connected to the
	R&amp;D development activities under the Amended Agreement. The JSC obligations, although considered deliverables under the arrangement, are immaterial in relation to the entire arrangement. Therefore, the licenses and JSC obligations were combined
	with the R&amp;D development activities, or unit (ii) identified above.

	Under the Amended Agreement, the Partner pays a fixed fee for
	each sample to be profiled; will reimburse the Company for a portion of costs incurred in performing analytical validation of the CDx assay; and will be required to make certain substantive milestone and other payments upon the achievement of
	specified regulatory and clinical events tied to the development and commercialization of the CDx. The fixed or determinable consideration under the Amended Agreement was allocated to the units of accounting based on the BESP. Consideration
	allocated to sample profiling is recognized as samples are delivered, which is when the recognition criteria in ASC 605-25 has been satisfied. Consideration allocated to the R&amp;D development activities and the analytical validation work is
	recognized using the proportional performance method. Both the Company and the Partner expect to negotiate the strategy and specifics of any commercial partnership upon obtaining regulatory approval of a CDx assay, at which point the fair value of
	any consideration obtained will be assessed.

	Under the Amended Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $10,618,000 for the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, primarily related to sample profiling and milestone payments received upon the achievement of specified regulatory and clinical events tied to the R&amp;D development activities of the CDx. Under the Amended Agreement
	and Services Agreement, the Company recognized combined revenue of $2,689,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, primarily related to sample profiling. Under the Services Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $1,017,000 for the year

	The Company did not hold any available-for-sale securities as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. The amortized cost of
	available-for-sale securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the balance in the Company&#146;s accumulated other comprehensive loss was composed solely of activity related
	to the Company&#146;s available-for-sale marketable securities. There were no realized gains or losses recognized during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, and as a result, the Company did not reclassify any amount out of accumulated other
	comprehensive loss for the same period.

	The aggregate fair value of securities held by the Company in an unrealized loss position for
	less than twelve months as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $114,546,000, which consisted of 14 U.S. government agency securities and 10 U.S. treasury securities. To determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company performs an
	analysis to assess whether it intends to sell, or whether it would more likely than not be required to sell, the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where the Company intends to sell a security, or may be required to
	do so, the security&#146;s decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is recognized on the statement of comprehensive loss as an other-than-temporary impairment charge. When this is not the
	case, the Company performs additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where the Company does not expect to receive cash flows,
	based on using a best estimate, sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and amount of the loss recognized in other income (expense). The Company has the intent and ability to hold all securities until recovery.

	In November 2010, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with Lighthouse Capital Partners VI, L.P., whereby the Company
	had access to borrow up to $5,000,000. The Company borrowed all $5,000,000 available under the Loan Agreement in increments greater than $100,000 through January&nbsp;31, 2012 (the &#147;Commitment Termination Date&#148;). For each advance, the
	Company paid interest only payments at a fixed rate of 8.25% for six months, followed by 36 months of interest and principal payments and a final payment of 4.5% of the advance. The debt was secured by certain property and equipment. The final
	payments were amortized over the term of the advances and recorded in interest expense. At December&nbsp;31, 2014, the loan was paid in full. In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company recorded interest expense in the accompanying
	consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss totaling $61,000 and $228,000 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company issued a warrant to purchase up to 200,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at a
	purchase price of $1.00 per share. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, the warrant was exercisable for 200,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In conjunction with the closing of the Company&#146;s initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;), the warrant
	was automatically converted into a warrant exercisable for 50,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $4.00 per share, which resulted in the reclassification of the related convertible preferred stock warrant liability to additional
	paid-in capital as the warrant met the criteria for equity classification upon conversion to a warrant for the purchase of common stock. In October 2013, Lighthouse Capital Partners completed a cashless exercise of the warrant and received 44,566
	shares of the Company&#146;s common stock.

	In November 2009, the Company issued 2,125,000 shares of common stock to the founders of the Company for
	consideration equal to the par value per share, the then estimated fair value of the common stock. The founders entered into restricted stock agreements whereby the shares of common stock issued were subject to vesting and became fully vested in
	November 2013. An additional 112,500 shares of common stock subject to repurchase were issued to employees and consultants at fair value during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. Shares subject to repurchase by the Company are recorded as a
	liability at their original purchase price. Shares subject to repurchase that were issued to non-employees are revalued at each vesting date and at the end of the reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded as stock-based compensation
	expense on a straight-line basis. As the Company&#146;s right to repurchase the shares lapses, the liability is reclassified to additional paid-in capital. There was no restricted stock activity outside of the 2010 Stock Plan and the 2013 Stock Plan

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had federal and state net
	operating loss carryforwards of approximately $175,300,000 and $159,100,000, respectively, which were available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards exclude approximately $36,600,000 and $32,400,000
	of deductions related to the exercise of stock options, respectively. This amount represents an excess tax benefit and has not been included in the gross deferred tax asset reflected for net operating losses and is credited directly to additional

	as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities.
	The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. Following the Roche transaction, as
	discussed in detail in Note 3, the Company conducted a Section&nbsp;382 study covering the period from corporate inception through April&nbsp;7, 2015, which was the closing date of the Roche transaction. This study concluded that

	The Company has not recorded any reserves for uncertain tax positions as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 or 2014. If the Company did record a reserve, it would be a component of income tax expense. The Company has not yet conducted a study of research and development credit carryforwards. This study may result in an adjustment to
	the Company&#146;s research and development credit carryforwards; however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had no accrued

	ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of
	available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its
	deferred tax assets at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, because the Company&#146;s management has determined that is it more likely than not that these assets will not be fully realized. The increase in the valuation allowance of
	$37,300,000 in 2015 primarily relates to the net loss incurred by the Company during that period.

	In
	May 2010, the Company commenced a facility lease which was due to expire in October 2015. In November 2013, the Company terminated this lease effective October&nbsp;31, 2013 (the &#147;Surrender Date&#148;). The Company paid rent, operating expenses
	and other charges due under the facility lease through the Surrender Date. In exchange for terminating the facility lease, the Company paid the landlord an additional $338,000 equal to two additional months of rent, operating expenses, and all other
	charges due under the facility lease, plus reimbursement to the landlord for a portion of the brokerage commissions incurred by the landlord in leasing the facility to a new tenant. In connection with the lease termination, the Company recorded an
	impairment charge of $439,000 associated with fixed assets left at the facility. The Company also reversed $290,000 of deferred rent associated with the lease. The Company recorded $730,000 of rent expense in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013
	associated with this lease.

	In 2013, the Company signed two separate facility leases. The first lease commenced in March 2013 and had a one year expected term which was
	terminated in October 2013. The second lease (the &#147;Headquarters Lease&#148;) for office and laboratory space at 150 Second Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts commenced in September 2013 and initially had an eight year expected term. The
	Headquarters Lease is subject to fixed rate escalation increases and the landlord waived the Company&#146;s rent obligation for the first 10.5 months of the lease, having an initial value of $3,300,000. The landlord also agreed to fund up to
	$9,239,000 in tenant improvements. The Company recorded the tenant improvements as leasehold improvements and deferred rent on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred rent is amortized as a reduction in rent expense over the term of the
	Headquarters Lease. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. In connection with the Company&#146;s termination of its prior lease at One Kendall Square, the rent abatement was reduced to
	approximately $1,841,000 and the expected term of the Headquarters Lease was reduced to 7.5 years. The Company began to record rent expense in April 2013 upon gaining access to and control of the space. Upon execution of the Headquarters Lease, the

	In July 2013, the Company entered into a five-year supply, service and support agreement (the &#147;Supply Agreement&#148;) with Illumina, Inc.
	(&#147;Illumina&#148;) for Illumina to provide products and services that support and can be used for the gene sequencing component of its molecular testing activities. During the term of the Supply Agreement, Illumina will supply the Company with
	sequencers, reagents and other consumables for use with the Illumina sequencers, and service contracts for the maintenance and repair of the sequencers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the term of the Supply Agreement, the Company is required to make a rolling forecast of its expected needs for reagents and other
	consumables, and it may place purchase orders for reagents and other consumables that conform to such forecast. Illumina may not unreasonably reject conforming purchase orders and will, in its reasonable discretion, accept additional purchase orders
	for quantities of reagents and other consumables beyond the Company&#146;s forecast requirements. During each six-month period the Company has a binding obligation to purchase an amount of reagents and other consumables equal to the greater of a
	percentage of its six-month forecast and a fixed minimum amount. Subject to discounts that vary depending on the volume of hardware and reagents and other consumables ordered, the price for sequencers and for service contracts is based on Illumina
	list prices, and the price for reagents and other consumables is based on contract prices that are fixed for a set period of time and may increase thereafter subject to limitations. The Supply Agreement does not require the Company to order minimum
	amounts of hardware, or to use exclusively the Illumina platform for conducting its sequencing. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company&#146;s minimum remaining purchase commitment for the remainder of the term of the Supply Agreement was not
	lower than approximately $6,197,000.
