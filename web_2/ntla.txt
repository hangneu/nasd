	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a leading gene editing company focused on the development of proprietary, potentially curative therapeutics utilizing a
	recently developed biological tool known as the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We believe that the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has the potential to transform medicine by permanently editing disease-associated genes in the human body with a single treatment course.
	We intend to leverage our leading scientific expertise, clinical development experience and intellectual property position to unlock broad therapeutic applications of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and develop a potential new class of therapeutic
	products.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2012, one of our co-founders and current scientific advisors, Dr.&nbsp;Jennifer Doudna, and her colleagues published a paper
	in the journal
<I>
	Science
</I>
	describing the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as a gene editing tool. Gene editing is the precise and targeted modification of the genetic material of cells. Since the publication of Dr.&nbsp;Doudna&#146;s landmark paper, more than
	2,600 research papers have been published on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The CRISPR/Cas9 system offers a revolutionary approach for therapeutic development due to its broad potential to precisely edit genes. This system can be used to make three
	general types of edits: knockouts, repairs and insertions. Each of these editing strategies takes advantage of naturally occurring biological mechanisms to effect the desired genetic alteration. This approach has the potential to provide curative
	therapeutic options for patients with chronic diseases by addressing the underlying genetic cause or driver of the disease.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Unlike
	earlier-generation gene editing technologies, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is simple and involves a single protein, Cas9, that can be directed to precisely cleave a target DNA sequence by using pieces of RNA, called guide RNAs, that specifically recognize
	the target DNA of interest. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics have the potential to be highly efficient, selective and scalable.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that CRISPR/Cas9 offers significant technical advantages and broader potential to edit genes over other gene editing methods. Such
	advantages include:

	Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by HBV, which can progress from acute to chronic infection in approximately 5-10% of infected
	adults. We believe we can use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to help eliminate the reservoirs of cccDNA, the source of chronic infection, which cannot be eradicated by current treatments, in HBV-infected patients. We intend to evaluate different knockout
	approaches to destroy or render inactive cccDNA
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	, including cleaving the cccDNA at a single site or at combinations of sites. We believe it is also possible that a common treatment solution can be developed for all genotypes, or
	genetic variants, of HBV because we can target portions of the cccDNA sequences that do not vary across genotypes. In addition, there is potential to reduce viral resistance as the virus itself is eradicated. We have completed a bioinformatics
	analysis of potential CRISPR/Cas9 target sites in the HBV genome to select a set of guide RNAs, including several that can be effective across all HBV genotypes.

	CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology is a novel technology that is not yet clinically validated for human
	therapeutic use. The approaches we are taking to discover and develop novel therapeutics using CRISPR/Cas9 systems are unproven and may never lead to marketable products. If we are unable to develop viable product candidates, achieve regulatory
	approval for any such product candidate or market and sell any product candidates, we may never achieve profitability.

	We are
	focused on developing potentially curative medicines utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. Although there have been significant advances in the field of gene therapy, which typically involves introducing a copy of a gene into a
	patient&#146;s cell, and gene editing in recent years, CRISPR-based gene editing technologies are new and largely unproven. The CRISPR/Cas9 technologies that we have licensed and that we intend to develop have not yet been clinically tested by us,
	nor are we aware of any clinical trials for safety or efficacy having been completed by third parties involving these technologies. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing products based on these technologies is both
	preliminary and limited. Successful development of products by us will require solving a number of issues, including safely delivering a therapeutic into target cells safely within the human body or in an
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	setting, optimizing the
	efficiency and specificity of such products, and ensuring the therapeutic selectivity of such products. There can be no assurance we will be successful in solving any or all of these issues.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have concentrated our research efforts to date on bringing CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics to the clinic for our initial indications, which we call
	our sentinel indications, and our future success is highly dependent on the successful development of CRISPR-based gene editing technologies, cellular delivery methods and therapeutic applications. Our sentinel indications are the focus of our
	initial development efforts, and we may decide to alter or abandon these programs as new data become available and we gain experience in developing CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics. We cannot be sure that our CRISPR/Cas9 technologies will yield
	satisfactory products that are safe and effective, scalable or profitable in our sentinel indications or any other indication we pursue.

	Public perception and related media coverage of potential therapy-related safety issues, including adoption of new therapeutics or novel
	approaches to treatment, as well as ethical concerns related specifically to gene editing and CRISPR/Cas9, may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials, or if any therapeutic is approved, of physicians to
	subscribe to the novel treatment mechanics. Physicians, hospitals and third-party payors often are slow to adopt new products, technologies and treatment practices that require additional upfront costs and training. Physicians may not be willing to
	undergo training to adopt this novel and personalized therapy, may decide the therapy is too complex to adopt without appropriate training and may choose not to administer the therapy. In addition, responses by the U.S., state or foreign governments
	to negative public perception or ethical concerns may result in new legislation or regulations that could limit our ability to develop or commercialize any product candidates, obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve
	profitability. Based on these and other factors, hospitals and payors may decide that the benefits of this new therapy do not or will not outweigh its costs.

	Our ability to generate product revenue is dependent on the success of

	Our ability to generate product revenue is highly dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval of and successfully commercialize one
	or more of our product candidates. Any product candidates we discover will require preclinical, clinical and regulatory review and approval in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market the products, substantial investment, access to sufficient
	commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of a product candidate, we must conduct extensive
	clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency, as well as the effectiveness of the product candidates in humans. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials and even if successful,

	Gene therapy in general, and gene editing in particular, remain novel technologies, with no gene therapy product approved to date in the United

	our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are more familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. In addition, responses by the U.S., state or foreign governments to negative public

	In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage
	and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to
	provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a
	given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide
	adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of our gene-modifying products. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a
	significant portion of the cost of our product candidates. Because our product candidates may have a higher cost of goods than conventional therapies, and may require long-term follow up evaluations, the risk that coverage and reimbursement rates
	may be inadequate for us to achieve profitability may be greater. There is significant uncertainty related to insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will
	decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.

	Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and
	third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide
	adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance

	with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining marketing approval of a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage

	Even if one or more product candidates

	the ability to get reimbursement at any price and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is

	As of December&nbsp;31,

	share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering
	to advance the research and development of our sentinel indications, to progress additional pipeline product candidates, to further develop our delivery technologies and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform and for working capital and other general
	corporate purposes. We believe that such proceeds, together with our existing cash, revenue under our collaborations with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., or Novartis, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, including a
	$75.0 million upfront payment received from Regeneron, and the proceeds from our concurrent private placements will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 36 months. However, changing circumstances may cause us to increase our

	Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing

	skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products using our technology. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these
	key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions for similar personnel. The market for qualified personnel in the biotechnology space generally,
	and gene editing and gene therapy fields in particular, in and around the Cambridge, Massachusetts area is especially competitive. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in
	formulating our research and development and commercialization strategies. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit

	There are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with

	proposed collaborator&#146;s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce

	The manufacturing process used to produce CRISPR/Cas9-based product candidates may be complex, as they are novel and have not been validated
	for clinical and commercial production. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, human

	Our product candidates will require processing steps that are more complex than
	those required for most small molecule drugs. Moreover, unlike small molecules, the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be
	sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we will employ multiple steps to control the manufacturing process to assure that the process works and the product candidate is made strictly and consistently
	in compliance with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims
	or insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other applicable standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs.

	The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products, including
	biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and other regulatory authorities. We are not permitted to market any biological product in the United States until we receive a biologics license from the FDA. We have
	not previously submitted a BLA to the FDA, or similar approval filings to comparable foreign authorities. A BLA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish that the product candidate is safe, pure and
	potent for each desired indication. The BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product, and the manufacturing facilities must complete a successful pre-license inspection. We expect
	the novel nature of our product candidates to create further challenges in obtaining regulatory approval. For example, the FDA has no experience with commercial development of CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies for human therapeutic use. The FDA may also
	require a panel of experts, referred to as an Advisory Committee, to deliberate on the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data to support approval. The opinion of the Advisory Committee, although not binding, may have a significant impact on our
	ability to obtain approval of any product candidates that we develop based on the completed clinical trials. Moreover, while we are not aware of any specific genetic or biomarker diagnostic tests for which regulatory approval would be necessary in
	order to advance any of our product candidates to clinical trials or potential commercialization, in the future regulatory agencies may require the development and approval of such tests. Accordingly, the regulatory approval pathway for such product

	Third-party payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of
	controlling healthcare costs. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In
	particular, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the Patient
	Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, was enacted, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private
	insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, subjects biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which
	rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug
	Rebate Program, extends the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals&nbsp;enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjects manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs
	and biologic agents and provides incentives to programs that increase the federal government&#146;s comparative effectiveness research. At this time, the full effect that the Affordable Care Act would have on our business remains unclear.

	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since
	the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August&nbsp;2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted
	deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of
	Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April&nbsp;2013, and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January&nbsp;2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of
	2012, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and other treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments
	to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.

	We may in the future be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our
	patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor or other claims challenging the inventorship of our patents or ownership of our intellectual property (including patents and intellectual property that we in-license). For example,
	the University of California, Berkeley patent family that is covered by our license agreement with Caribou is co-owned by UC/Vienna and Dr.&nbsp;Charpentier, and our sublicense rights are derived from the first two co-owners and not from
	Dr.&nbsp;Charpentier. Therefore, our rights to these patents are not exclusive and third parties, including competitors, may have access to intellectual property that is important to our business. In addition, co-owners from whom we do not yet have
	a license may raise claims surrounding inventorship or ownership of patents that ultimately issue from this patent family, potentially resulting in issued patents to which we would not have rights under our existing license. Further, in
	jurisdictions outside the United&nbsp;States, a license may not be enforceable unless all the owners of the intellectual property agree or consent to the license. Accordingly, Dr.&nbsp;Charpentier could seek monetary or equitable relief requiring us
	to pay her compensation for, or refrain from, exploiting these patents due to the co-ownership of the UC/Vienna intellectual property we license through Caribou. In addition, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of
	consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary
	damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending

	Composition of matter patents for biological and pharmaceutical products are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual

	of our product candidates will be considered patentable by the USPTO or by patent offices in foreign countries, or that the claims in any of our ultimately issued patents will be considered valid and enforceable by courts in the United States or
	foreign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside
	the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products &#147;off-label&#148; for those uses that are covered by our method of use

	The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field can be uncertain, and evaluating the scope of such patents involves
	complex legal and scientific analyses. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover any product candidates or uses thereof in the United States or in other foreign countries. Even if
	the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability, or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our
	patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing their products to avoid being covered by our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications
	we hold is threatened, this could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and could threaten our ability to commercialize, product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which
	we could market product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. Because patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to
	file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, for U.S. applications in which all claims are entitled to a priority date before March&nbsp;16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or
	instituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. For U.S. applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March&nbsp;16, 2013, there is a
	greater level of uncertainty in the patent law in view of the passage of the America Invents Act,&nbsp;which brought into effect significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, including new procedures for challenging pending patent applications and

	product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United&nbsp;States and other

	employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors, and collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information to competitors. In addition, competitors may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or

	Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with
	intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or
	other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

	If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering
	one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability
	are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or other jurisdictions,
	even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination,
<I>
	inter partes
</I>
	&nbsp;review, post-grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, such as opposition or derivation proceedings. Such proceedings
	could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover and protect our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the
	validity of our patents, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we, our patent counsel, and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of
	invalidity, unpatentability and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.

	Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime
	of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. Although an inadvertent lapse can
	in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or
	complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment
	of fees, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In any such event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.

	the offering. The lack of an active market may impair investors&#146; ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, may reduce the market value of their shares and may impair our ability
	to raise capital.

	Our historical net tangible book value as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $67.4&nbsp;million, or $26.32&nbsp;per share of our common stock. Our

	stock outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	shares of common stock in the concurrent private placements to Regeneron and Novartis at an assumed initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 would have been
	approximately $198.8&nbsp;million, or approximately $5.80&nbsp;per share. This amount represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of $3.21&nbsp;per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution in pro forma

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	are a leading gene editing company focused on the development of proprietary, potentially curative therapeutics utilizing a recently developed biological tool known as CRISPR/Cas9. We believe that the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has the potential to
	transform medicine by permanently editing disease-associated genes in the human body with a single treatment course. We intend to leverage our leading scientific expertise, clinical development experience and intellectual property position to unlock
	broad therapeutic applications of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and develop a potential new class of therapeutic products.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe our
	strong product focus, therapeutic discovery and development strength, delivery expertise and intellectual property portfolio make us well-positioned to translate the potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into clinically meaningful gene editing-based
	therapeutics. To maximize our opportunity to rapidly develop clinically successful products, we have applied a risk-mitigated approach to selecting our initial indications, which we refer to as our sentinel indications. Our approach is defined by
	four primary axes: (i)&nbsp;the type of edit&#151;knockout, repair or insertion; (ii) the delivery modality for
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	and
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	applications; (iii)&nbsp;the presence of established therapeutic endpoints; and (iv)&nbsp;the potential
	for the CRISPR/Cas9 system to provide therapeutic benefits when compared to existing therapeutic modalities. Our sentinel indications include
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	programs focused on diseases of the liver that have significant unmet medical needs &#150;
	transthyretin amyloidosis, which we are co-developing with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hepatitis B virus and inborn errors of metabolism&nbsp;&#150; as well as
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	applications of the
	technology in chimeric antigen receptor T cell, or CAR T cell, and hematopoietic stem cell, or HSC, product candidates which are selectively partnered with our collaborator, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research Inc., or Novartis.

	We commenced active operations in mid-2014, and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business
	planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and evaluating a clinical path for our pipeline programs. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through
	private placements of our equity securities and funding received from our collaboration and license agreement with Novartis. All of our revenue to date has been collaboration revenue. Since our inception and through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have
	raised an aggregate of approximately $104.0&nbsp;million to fund our operations, of which approximately $19.0 million was through our collaboration with Novartis and approximately $85.0&nbsp;million was from the sale of our equity, principally
	preferred securities. In addition, we received $75.0 million in the form of an upfront payment under our collaboration with Regeneron in April 2016.

	Since inception, we have incurred operating losses. Our net loss was $9.5 million for the period from May&nbsp;7, 2014 (inception) to
	December&nbsp;31, 2014, primarily as a result of the cost of obtaining in-licensed CRISPR/Cas9 intellectual property, and $12.4 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had

	an accumulated deficit of $21.9 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from
	quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we: advance the programs for our sentinel indications toward clinical development; continue the research and development of our other potential
	product candidates and delivery modalities; seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; ultimately establish a sales, marketing and
	distribution infrastructure and scale up external and/or internal manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire additional
	clinical, regulatory and scientific personnel; and add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts.

	In December 2014, we
	entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Novartis focused on the development of new
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies using CAR T cells and HSCs. Under the terms of our agreement, we received a $10.0 million upfront
	technology access payment in January 2015. In addition, we are entitled to receive $20.0&nbsp;million in additional technology access fees and up to $20.0&nbsp;million in research payments, in the aggregate, over the five-year collaboration term.
	For each product under the collaboration, we may be eligible to receive (i) up to $30.3 million in development milestones, including for the filing of an investigational new drug application and for the dosing of the first patient in each of Phase
	IIa, Phase IIb and Phase III clinical trials, (ii) up to $50.0 million in regulatory milestones for the product&#146;s first indication, including regulatory approvals in the U.S. and the European Union, or EU, (iii) up to $50.0 million in
	regulatory milestones for the product&#146;s second indication, if any, including U.S. and EU regulatory approvals, (iv) royalties on net sales in the mid-single digits, and (v) net sales milestone payments of up to $100.0 million. We retain
	exclusive rights to research a limited number of HSC targets for our proprietary pipeline. In addition, prior to our entry into our collaboration with Novartis, we entered into an exclusivity agreement with Novartis pursuant to which we agreed to
	issue preferred securities to Novartis. We received $9.0 million from the sale of such securities to Novartis. We also received approximately $4.0 million from the sale of Series B preferred stock to Novartis in our Series&nbsp;B preferred stock
	financing. See the section entitled &#147;Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions&#148; appearing elsewhere in this prospectus for more information.

	In April 2016, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron. The agreement includes a product component to research,
	develop and commercialize CRISPR/Cas-based therapeutic products primarily focused on gene editing in the liver as well as a technology collaboration component, pursuant to which we and Regeneron will engage in research and development activities
	aimed at discovering and developing novel technologies and improvements to CRISPR/Cas technology to enhance our gene editing platform.

	Net cash used in operating activities of $2.3 million during the period from May&nbsp;7, 2014 (inception) to December&nbsp;31, 2014 consisted
	primarily of compensation and related expenses as well as legal and consulting costs incurred with the initial phases of establishing our company&#146;s operations and early research activities performed by Caribou. Net cash used in operating
	activities of $1.8&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 primarily reflected compensation, lab and professional service expenses as well as amounts paid by us under the Caribou services agreement during the period, partially offset
	by the receipt of a $10.0 million upfront technology access payment and $5.0&nbsp;million annual technology access fee under the Novartis collaboration agreement.

	Massachusetts. Purchases of property and equipment increased during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 as we completed the build-out of this office and laboratory space. We expect purchases of property and equipment to increase in 2016 as we

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our collaboration and license agreements represent multiple-element arrangements. We evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper
	classification in our statements of operations based on the nature of the underlying activity. We generally reflect as revenue amounts due under our collaborative agreements related to reimbursement of development activities as we are generally the
	principal under the arrangement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (i)&nbsp;the deliverables included in the
	arrangement and (ii)&nbsp;whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. When deliverables are separable, consideration received is allocated to the
	separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit. When we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we
	must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. This evaluation requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the
	other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that (i)&nbsp;the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii)&nbsp;if the arrangement includes a general
	right of return with respect to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research,
	development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use any other
	deliverable for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverable, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item, and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered items.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The consideration received under an arrangement that is fixed or determinable is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on
	the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if available; third-party evidence of selling
	price if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available; or best estimate of selling price, if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a unit of
	accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the best estimate of selling price for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in
	negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the best estimate of selling price for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the best estimate of selling price will
	have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.

	We recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the
	revenue recognition criteria are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, we recognize revenue from the combined unit of accounting over the contractual or
	estimated performance period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we
	recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over which the service is provided to the customer can be determined
	and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the

	Our

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the
	contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (i)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result
	of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (ii)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (iii)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms
	within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the particular
	milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. We will recognize revenue in its entirety upon
	successful accomplishment of any substantive milestones, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive are recognized as earned if there are no remaining performance obligations or over the

	not considered to be substantive, revenue from achievement of milestones is initially deferred and recognized over the remaining term of our performance obligations. Milestones that are not considered substantive because we do not contribute effort

	As there has been no public market for our common or incentive units and common stock to date, the estimated fair value of our common and
	incentive units and common stock has been determined by our board of directors as of the date of each award grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common and incentive units and common
	stock and our board of directors&#146; assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party

	Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation

	.
	Our common and incentive security valuations were prepared using either an option-pricing method, or OPM, or a probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM, which used a combination of market approaches and an income approach to estimate
	our enterprise value. The OPM treats common securities and preferred securities as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a
	company&#146;s securities changes. Under this method, the common and incentive units and common stock have value only if the funds available for distribution to members exceeded the value of the preferred security liquidation preference at the time
	of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. The PWERM is a scenario-based methodology that estimates the fair value of common and incentive units and common stock based upon an analysis of future values for the company, assuming
	various outcomes. The common and incentive units and common stock values are based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each

	The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; such as us to take advantage
	of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We are irrevocably choosing to &#147;opt out&#148; of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting
	standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No.&nbsp;2014-09,
<I>
	Revenue from Contracts with Customers
</I>
	(
<I>
	Topic 606
</I>
	), which supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard&#146;s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to
	customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard defines a five-step process to achieve this principle and will require companies to use more
	judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. We expect that these judgments and estimates will include identifying performance obligations in the customer contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in
	the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
	contracts. In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date of this standard such that ASU 2014-09 will be effective for us for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a leading gene editing
	company focused on the development of proprietary, potentially curative therapeutics utilizing a recently developed biological tool known as the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We believe that the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has the potential to transform medicine
	by permanently editing disease-associated genes in the human body with a single treatment course. We intend to leverage our leading scientific expertise, clinical development experience and intellectual property position to unlock broad therapeutic
	applications of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and develop a potential new class of therapeutic products.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2012, one of our co-founders and
	current scientific advisors, Dr.&nbsp;Jennifer Doudna, and her colleagues published a paper in the journal
<I>
	Science
</I>
	describing the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as a gene editing tool. Gene editing is the precise and targeted modification of the genetic
	material of cells. Since the publication of Dr.&nbsp;Doudna&#146;s landmark paper, more than 2,600 research papers have been published on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The CRISPR/Cas9 system offers a revolutionary approach for therapeutic development
	due to its broad potential to precisely edit genes. This system can be used to make three general types of edits: knockouts, repairs and insertions. Each of these editing strategies takes advantage of naturally-occurring biological mechanisms to
	effect the desired genetic alteration. This approach has the potential to provide curative therapeutic options for patients with chronic diseases by addressing the underlying cause of the disease.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We plan to use the CRISPR/Cas9 system across two broad areas:
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	applications, in which CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutic products are
	delivered directly to target cells within the body, and
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	applications, in which cells are removed from a patient&#146;s body, modified using CRISPR/Cas9 and then returned to the patient. Initially, our
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	pipeline includes
	proprietary programs targeting transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR, which we are co-developing with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD, hepatitis B virus, or HBV, and inborn errors of metabolism, or
	IEMs. Our initial
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	pipeline includes both proprietary and partnered programs focused on chimeric antigen receptor T&nbsp;cells, or CAR T cells, and hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, the stem cells from which all of the various types
	of blood cells originate, which we are developing in collaboration with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., or Novartis.

	Gene
	editing is the precise and targeted modification of the genetic material of cells. Gene editing works by using an enzyme to make a cut at a particular sequence in the genome, followed by deletions, repairs or insertions of genetic material at the
	cut site facilitated by the cell&#146;s natural DNA repair mechanisms. Coupled with recent advances, including a greater understanding of genetic diseases and maturation of gene therapy and associated delivery technologies, the development of gene
	editing tools that can permanently and precisely edit DNA may enable the development of therapies that can address, and potentially cure, the cause of DNA-based diseases.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Accordingly, we believe that gene editing has the potential to treat a broad range of diseases not adequately addressed by more traditional
	therapeutic modalities such as small molecules and biologics. Given its permanent effects on the target DNA in question, gene editing could potentially cure a disease with a single treatment course as opposed to the multi-treatment or chronic dosing
	regimens often seen with traditional modalities, which typically have transient effects and may require life-long treatment. Additionally, unlike gene therapy, which typically involves introducing a copy of a gene into a patient&#146;s cells, gene
	editing has the potential to make permanent, precise changes directly to the target gene in its normal location, repairing the underlying genetic mutation. This attribute may provide a significant competitive edge over gene therapy, as gene editing
	can yield a result close to or identical to the normal biological system in addition to addressing a broader spectrum of diseases.

	Earlier-generation gene editing methods such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) use
	pairs of synthetic proteins engineered to recognize specific DNA sequences. While these systems have contributed to the clinical development and regulatory pathway for gene editing therapies, their development is relatively complex and costly
	because each synthetic protein may have variable cleavage activity and can be challenging and time consuming to manufacture because both proteins in the pair must be redesigned for each new target DNA sequence.

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	One of our co-founders and current scientific advisors, Dr.&nbsp;Rodolphe Barrangou, and other researchers originally characterized CRISPR/Cas
	systems as naturally occurring defense mechanisms in various bacterial species that protect against foreign DNA. In 2012, another one of our co-founders and current scientific advisors, Dr.&nbsp;Jennifer Doudna, and her colleagues published a paper
	in the journal
<I>
	Science
</I>
	describing the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as a gene editing tool. Following Dr.&nbsp;Doudna&#146;s pioneering work, researchers were able to demonstrate the simplicity and versatility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system by quickly
	applying the system in a variety of contexts to better understand biological mechanisms and investigate disease models, resulting in more than 2,600 published papers since 2012.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Generally, CRISPR/Cas systems include one or more proteins that cleave DNA guided by an RNA guide sequence, pieces of RNA that both recognize
	specific DNA sequences and activate the cleaving activity of the Cas proteins. In the original bacterial systems, arrays of RNA sequences that recognize foreign DNA are sometimes referred to as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
	repeats, or CRISPRs, while certain proteins have been named as numbered CRISPR associated, or Cas, proteins. Currently, the simplest and most versatile type of CRISPR/Cas system uses the Cas9 protein as the DNA cutting enzyme, as described in
	Dr.&nbsp;Doudna&#146;s seminal paper.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Two basic components of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system are the Cas9 protein and a guide RNA
	sequence that recognizes and directs the Cas9 to a specific target DNA sequence. The system edits DNA as follows:

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because an RNA sequence complementary to any DNA sequence can be rapidly designed and synthesized, a
	CRISPR/Cas9 system can be efficiently and specifically reprogrammed by changing only the guide RNA sequence, without any need to modify the cutting protein. The simplicity of programming the CRISPR/Cas9 system, coupled with its efficiency and
	flexibility, opens the door to a wide range of

	AATD is an inherited genetic disorder that may cause lung or liver disease. The lung disease may result in chronic obstructive pulmonary
	disease, or COPD, a progressive disease that causes substantial morbidity and mortality while the liver disease is characterized by inflammation and cirrhosis of the liver. In the United States, an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 people have AATD, which
	is the result of a mutation in the
<I>
	SERPINA1
</I>
	gene that normally produces secreted alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT, protein. AAT is a protease inhibitor that blocks the activity of various enzymes such as neutrophil elastase, which is an enzyme
	that fights infections, but when not adequately controlled by AAT, can attack normal tissues, such as lung tissue.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The most common form of
	AATD arises when a patient has a mutation in both copies of the
<I>
	SERPINA1
</I>
	gene, which causes AAT to aggregate inside liver cells, or hepatocytes, rather than being secreted from the liver. The inability to secrete AAT leaves the lung
	unprotected from neutrophil elastase and can result in pulmonary disease. The pulmonary consequences of AATD can sometimes culminate in COPD. Estimates suggest that between 1% and 2% of all cases of COPD in the United States have AATD as the
	underlying cause. In some patients, AAT accumulates in the liver, causing liver inflammation and cirrhosis, which leads to liver damage, scarring and in the most severe cases, liver failure or cancer. Liver disease associated with AATD is diagnosed
	from infancy to adulthood, whereas lung disease is most common in adult patients.

	gene. We intend to evaluate
	two editing approaches&#151;a knockout and a repair. Our knockout program for AATD will be best suited for patients with AATD-associated liver disease, as there is currently no effective way to reduce the accumulation of mutated AAT in the liver.
	With this strategy, we intend to eliminate production of the aberrant form of AAT by knocking out the mutated
<I>
	SERPINA1
</I>
	gene with a Cas9-mediated cut. We believe this knockout will halt the production and accumulation of AAT in the liver but
	will not by itself address the lack of AAT circulation that leads to lung disease. Therefore, in this approach, we expect that patients with AATD-associated lung disease will be treated with plasma protein supplementation to achieve levels of the
	normal form of AAT to be active against the lung disease. Appropriate guide RNA selection will be important for achieving this knockout with high specificity and high efficiency.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	gene, which we believe will eliminate production of the aberrant form of AAT and also establish production of the normal protein in the liver. We believe this correction will reduce or eliminate liver inflammation and
	increase levels of normal circulating AAT, which should protect the lung from neutrophil elastase, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for plasma protein augmentation therapy. There is preclinical evidence that hepatocytes with normal AAT may
	possess a growth advantage over those that express the mutated form, suggesting that repair of only a limited number of hepatocytes might be sufficient to address this disease. We expect the progress of this program to follow our AATD knockout
	program. Depending on the results of our studies and potential development requirements and timelines, we may decide to pursue one or both of our knockout and repair programs in clinical development.

	Future indications requiring delivery to tissues in organs beyond the liver, such as the eye, muscle or central nervous system, will require
	more research and development work, including around next generation delivery methods. As we progress our sentinel liver programs, we are actively investigating additional delivery methods, including evaluating multiple viral delivery vectors that
	may allow us to explore therapies for indications in additional tissues. One viral vector that we are evaluating, adeno-associated virus, or AAV, is already utilized in a gene therapy product approved in the European Union, or EU. While AAV has
	enough capacity to deliver a Cas9 protein and guide RNA, a second vector would be required for applications involving a larger DNA repair template. We believe that using a multi-vector system is feasible for effecting more complex repairs; however,
	we are also exploring alternative viral delivery systems including larger capacity vectors based on adenovirus, lentivirus and herpes simplex virus. In certain cases, these viral vectors can be modified to deliver nucleic acid material to specific
	cells or tissue types, allowing for customized delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components to the cells needing repair. Given the variety of possible genetic targets for CRISPR/Cas9, we are currently evaluating the technologies of several academic groups and
	companies with expertise in various delivery systems to determine the best delivery vehicle for different therapeutic indications. In choosing a delivery vehicle for a particular application, we will consider factors including capacity, delivery
	specificity and efficiency, clinical safety, immunogenicity and manufacturing ability. Internally, we are developing CRISPR/Cas9 components and systems that we believe can be easily adapted to multiple delivery systems.

	We are subject to extensive regulation. We expect our future product candidates to be regulated as biologics. Biological products are subject
	to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&amp;C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&amp;C Act and the PHS Act and their
	corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products.
	Before clinical testing of biological products in the United States may begin, we must submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA, which reviews the clinical protocol, and the IND must become effective before clinical trials
	may begin. In some instances, we must also submit our protocols to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, for review before initiating clinical testing.

	recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are also subject to review by the NIH RAC. Moreover, certain therapeutic protocols that raise important scientific, safety, medical, ethical, or social issues are discussed at the RAC&#146;s quarterly
	public meetings. While the FDA has not provided specific guidance on gene editing in humans, it has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects
	involved in gene therapy clinical trials for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs.

	Although the FDA has not yet approved any human gene therapy product for sale, it has provided guidance for the development of gene therapy
	products which may be relevant to gene editing products as well. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, or OCTGT, within CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the
	Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee, or CTGTAC, to advise CBER on its reviews. In addition, the FDA has issued a growing body of clinical, chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, guidance and other guidance, all of which are
	intended to facilitate industry&#146;s development of gene therapy products. In 2012, the European Medicines Agency approved a gene therapy product called Glybera, which is the first gene therapy product approved by regulatory authorities anywhere

	Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene-editing technology, gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research
	could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive
	regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any product candidates. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product

	Where a study involving the transfer of nucleic acids into humans is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for

	many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee that reviews research proposals involving human-gene transfer
	research and discusses, if needed, protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The RAC decides whether a protocol raises issues that warrant further
	discussion at its quarterly meetings, and the OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#146;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a particular protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed

	The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information,
	analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after
	receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy
	protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion
	of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to, among other reasons, safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA
	imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that,
	once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.

	Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy
	volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor&#146;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of
	the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur.
	Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA&#146;s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the
	requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be
	conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated
	benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Certain clinical trials also must
	be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and all forms of research conducted at that institution involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. The IBC assesses the safety

	Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees
	on an annual basis. According to the FDA&#146;s fee schedule, effective through September&nbsp;30, 2016, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, is $2,374,200. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics
	($114,450) and an annual establishment fee ($585,200) on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application

	Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the
	agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional
	information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine,
	among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve
	the product&#146;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee,
	typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory
	committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe
	use of the biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.

	Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless
	it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, cGTP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before
	approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and cGCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must
	incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.

	Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory
	criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the
	FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring
	additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may

	recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed

	In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical
	trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not
	approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven&nbsp;years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the
	manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has
	exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and then used off-label. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years
	if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product
	designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.

	review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing
	treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to
	predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the
	availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition,
	the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated

	clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance
	of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping
	requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part

	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use
	of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman
	Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent
	beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a
	BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension
	and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent within a 60 day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and

	Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference

	the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for
	a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the
	structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does
	not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess
	whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the &#147;first licensure&#148; of a biological product is determined

	EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. To improve the current system, a new Regulation No.&nbsp;536/2014 on clinical trials on
	medicinal product candidates for human use, which will repeal Directive 2001/20/EC, was adopted on April&nbsp;16, 2014 and published in the European Official Journal on May&nbsp;27, 2014. The new Regulation aims at harmonizing and streamlining the
	clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency. The new Regulation entered into force on June&nbsp;16, 2014 but will apply not
	earlier than May&nbsp;28, 2016. Until then the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will continue to apply. In addition, the transitional provisions of the new Regulation offer, under certain conditions, the clinical trial sponsors the possibility

	authority, with one of them appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the Committee acting as a Co-Rapporteur. The CHMP has 210 days to adopt an opinion as to whether a

	In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional
	two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a
	generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its
	product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten
	years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications, which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with

	The EU also provides other opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, products receiving orphan designation in

	pediatric studies.

	The criteria for designating an &#147;orphan medicinal product&#148; in the European Union are similar in principle to
	those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1)&nbsp;it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating
	condition; (2)&nbsp;either (a)&nbsp;such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b)&nbsp;the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate
	sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3)&nbsp;there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the
	product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a
	marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will
	receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not
	convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

	In addition

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute
	prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing,
	ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly
	interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a
	number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce
	prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception
	or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances.
	Several courts have interpreted the statute&#146;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as
	amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in
	order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes
	of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.

	that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#146; marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., off-label) uses. In addition,
	the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not
	provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the

	The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional
	federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling
	or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or
	fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud

	In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other

	physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value
	and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1&nbsp;million per year for &#147;knowing failures.&#148; Covered manufacturers were required to begin
	collecting data on August&nbsp;1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to the government for the first reporting period (August&nbsp;1, 2013 &#150; December&nbsp;31, 2013) by March&nbsp;31, 2014, and were required to report detailed
	payment data for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the completeness and accuracy of such data by June&nbsp;30, 2014. Thereafter, covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th&nbsp;day of each subsequent calendar
	year. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry&#146;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose
	restrictions on marketing practices, or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain
	regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of
	the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory

	The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological

	products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization
	of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply
	that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally,
	coverage and reimbursement for new products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor&#146;s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the
	medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately
	and will be a time-consuming process.

	The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments,
	and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the
	cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other
	available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.

	reimbursement for particular medical products. By way of example, in the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare
	covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient drug purchases by those covered by Medicare under a new Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for
	Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of pharmaceutical products, there is additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for
	Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments
	from private payors. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of the MMA could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products, and could seriously harm our business.

	In addition, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most
	manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected,
	extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers&#146; outpatient
	drugs coverage under Medicare Part D, and subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#146; share of sales to federal healthcare programs.

	On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on
	Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several
	government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is
	taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers.

	We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that
	federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.

	As of April 22, 2016, our board of directors consisted of seven members, each of whom are members pursuant to the board composition provisions
	of our certificate of incorporation and agreements with our stockholders. These board composition provisions will terminate upon the completion of this offering. Upon the termination of these provisions, there will be no further contractual
	obligations regarding the election of our directors. Our nominating and corporate governance committee and our board of directors may therefore consider a broad range of factors relating to the qualifications and background of nominees. Our
	nominating and corporate governance committee&#146;s and our board of directors&#146; priority in selecting board members is identification of persons who will further the interests of our stockholders through their established record of
	professional accomplishment, the ability to contribute positively to the collaborative culture among board members, knowledge of our business, understanding of the competitive landscape, professional and personal experiences and expertise relevant
	to our growth strategy. Our directors hold office until their successors have been elected and qualified or until the earlier of their resignation or removal. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will become effective upon the
	closing of this offering and amended and restated bylaws that will become effective upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part also provide that our directors may be removed only for cause by the
	affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in an annual election of directors, and that any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of
	our board of directors, may be filled only by vote of a majority of our directors then in office.

	Our board of directors has determined that all members of the board of directors, except Drs. Bermingham, Leonard and Haurwitz, are independent

	director has with us and all other facts and circumstances that our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. In considering the
	independence of the directors listed above, our board of directors considered the association of our directors with the holders of more than 5% of our common stock. Upon the completion of this offering, we expect that the composition and functioning
	of our board of directors and each of our committees will comply with all applicable requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market and the rules and regulations of the SEC. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive

	Currently, the role of chairman of the board is separated from the role of Chief Executive Officer, and we plan to keep these roles separated

	role of providing advice to and independent oversight of management. Our board of directors recognizes the time, effort and energy that the Chief Executive Officer is required to devote to his position in the current business environment, as well as
	the commitment required to serve as our chairman, particularly as the board of directors&#146; oversight responsibilities continue to grow. While our amended and restated by-laws and corporate governance guidelines do not require that our chairman
	and Chief Executive Officer positions be separate, our board of directors believes that having separate positions is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance.

	Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a number of risks,
	including risks relating to our financial condition, development and commercialization activities, operations, strategic direction and intellectual property as more fully discussed in the section entitled &#147;Risk Factors&#148; appearing elsewhere
	in this prospectus. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks we face, while our board of directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role,
	our board of directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The role of the board of directors in overseeing the management of our risks is conducted primarily through committees of the board of
	directors, as disclosed in the descriptions of each of the committees below and in the charters of each of the committees. The full board of directors (or the appropriate board committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a
	particular committee) discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on us, and the steps we take to manage them. When a board committee is responsible for evaluating and overseeing the management of a particular risk or
	risks, the chairman of the relevant committee reports on the discussion to the full board of directors during the committee reports portion of the next board meeting. This enables the board of directors and its committees to coordinate the risk
	oversight role, particularly with respect to risk interrelationships.

	Our
	executive compensation program has reflected our growth and development-oriented corporate culture. To date, the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and our other executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table below, who we
	refer to as the named executive officers, has primarily consisted of a combination of base salary, bonuses and long-term incentive compensation in the form of restricted stock awards. Our named executive officers, like all full-time employees, are
	eligible to participate in our health and welfare benefit plans. As we transition from a private company to a publicly traded company, we will evaluate our compensation values and philosophy and compensation plans and arrangements as circumstances
	require. At a minimum, we expect to review executive compensation annually with input from a compensation consultant. As part of this review process, we expect the board of directors and the compensation committee to apply our values and philosophy,
	while considering the compensation levels needed to ensure our executive compensation program remains competitive. We will also review whether we are meeting our retention objectives and the potential cost of replacing a key employee.

</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, was adopted by our board of directors on January&nbsp;19, 2016 and approved by our stockholders
	on April 22, 2016 and will become effective on the date immediately prior to the date on which the registration statement of which this prospectus is part is declared effective by the SEC. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an &#147;employee stock
	purchase plan&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;423(b) of the Code. The ESPP initially reserves and authorizes the issuance of up to a total of 441,176 shares of common stock to participating employees. The ESPP provides that the number of
	shares reserved and available for issuance will automatically increase each January&nbsp;1, beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2017 and each January&nbsp;1 thereafter through January&nbsp;1, 2026, by the least of (i)&nbsp;1% of the outstanding number of
	shares of our common stock on the immediately preceding December&nbsp;31; (ii)&nbsp;500,000 shares or (iii) such number of shares as determined by the ESPP administrator. The number of shares reserved under the ESPP is subject to adjustment in the
	event of a stock split, stock dividend or other change in our capitalization.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	All employees who have completed at least 30 days of
	employment and whose customary employment is for more than 20 hours per week are eligible to participate in the ESPP. However, any employee who owns 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock is not eligible to
	purchase shares under the ESPP.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We will make one or more offerings each year to our employees to purchase shares under the ESPP. Offerings
	will usually begin on each January&nbsp;1 and July&nbsp;1 and will continue for six-month periods, referred to as offering periods. Each eligible employee may elect to participate in any offering by submitting an enrollment form at least 15 business
	days before the relevant offering date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Each employee who is a participant in the ESPP may purchase shares by authorizing payroll
	deductions of up to 10% of his or her base compensation during an offering period. Unless the participating employee has previously withdrawn from the offering, his or her accumulated payroll deductions will be used to purchase shares on the last
	business day of the offering period at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the shares on the first business day or the last business day of the offering period, whichever is lower. Under applicable tax rules, an employee may purchase no
	more than $25,000 worth of shares of common stock, valued at the start of the purchase period, under the ESPP in any calendar year.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	accumulated payroll deductions of any employee who is not a participant on the last day of an offering period will be refunded. An employee&#146;s rights under the ESPP terminate upon voluntary withdrawal from the plan or when the employee ceases
	employment with us for any reason.
</P>

	increases the number of shares of common stock authorized under the ESPP and certain other amendments require the approval of our stockholders.

	directors were to determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of our stockholders, our board of directors could cause shares of preferred stock to be issued without stockholder approval in one or more private offerings or other
	transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder or stockholder group. In this regard, our certificate of incorporation grants our board of directors broad power to establish the rights and
	preferences of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of shares of common stock. The issuance may also

	Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our shares. Future sales of our common stock in the public market, or the

	contractual and legal restrictions on resale. Nevertheless, sales of our common stock in the public market after such restrictions lapse, or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price at such time

	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to
	close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. If the
	underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the
	underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

	We dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, as our independent registered public accounting firm on November&nbsp;11, 2015 effective as of
	that date. Our board of directors participated in and approved our change in independent registered public accounting firm. PwC issued their audit report, dated September&nbsp;4, 2015, on our consolidated financial statements as of December&nbsp;31,
	2014 and for the period from May&nbsp;7, 2014 (inception) to December&nbsp;31, 2014. The report of PwC on our consolidated financial statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and for the period from May&nbsp;7, 2014 (inception) to December&nbsp;31,
	2014 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to audit scope, accounting principle or uncertainty. During the period from May&nbsp;7, 2014 (inception) to December&nbsp;31, 2014 and the subsequent
	interim period through November&nbsp;11, 2015, (i)&nbsp;there were no disagreements (as that term is used in Item&nbsp;304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation&nbsp;S-K and the related instructions) with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
	financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in their report on our audited consolidated financial statements for the
	period from May&nbsp;7, 2014 (inception) to December&nbsp;31, 2014, and (ii)&nbsp;there were no &#147;reportable events&#148; as such term is defined in Item&nbsp;304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation&nbsp;S-K.

	We engaged Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP, or Deloitte, as our independent registered public accounting firm on November&nbsp;17, 2015. The

	as our independent registered public accounting firm on November&nbsp;17, 2015, neither we nor anyone acting on our behalf consulted with Deloitte regarding: (1)&nbsp;the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or contemplated
	transaction; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated financial statements and Deloitte did not provide any written report or oral advice that Deloitte concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a
	decision as to any such accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (2)&nbsp;any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in S-K 304(a)(1)(iv) and the related instructions to S-K 304, or a reportable

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
	internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
	opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
	financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Intellia

	Intellia Therapeutics was formed in May 2014 in the state of Delaware as AZRN, Inc. and amended its certificate of
	incorporation in July 2014 to change its name from AZRN, Inc. to Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. In July 2014, Intellia Therapeutics, LLC was formed as the parent company of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. In August&nbsp;2015, the Company completed a series
	of transactions pursuant to which Intellia Therapeutics, LLC merged with and into its C corporation subsidiary, Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., with Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. continuing to exist as the surviving corporation (the
	&#147;Reorganization&#148;). In connection with the Reorganization, all of the outstanding common and preferred unitholders of Intellia Therapeutics, LLC received shares of preferred stock of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., and holders of incentive
	units in Intellia Therapeutics, LLC received shares of restricted common stock in Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. There was no impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of the Reorganization except for the reclassification of
	members&#146; equity to stockholders&#146; equity or temporary equity.

	Intellia Therapeutics, LLC (collectively referred to with its
	wholly owned, controlled subsidiary, Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., as &#147;Intellia&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a gene editing company focused on developing potentially curative therapeutics utilizing a recently developed biological tool
	known as CRISPR/Cas9.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early stage companies in the biotechnology industry,
	including, but not limited to, development by competitors of more advanced or effective therapies, dependence on key executives, protection of and dependence on proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and ability to secure
	additional capital to fund operations. Programs currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These
	efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the Company&#146;s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever,
	the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a basis that
	assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has funded its operations
	with proceeds from the sale of capital stock and with payments received under its collaboration arrangement with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (&#147;Novartis&#148;). Since its inception, the Company has incurred recurring
	losses, including net losses of $9.5 million for the period from May&nbsp;7, 2014 (inception) to December&nbsp;31, 2014 and $12.4 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses in the
	foreseeable future.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents of $75.8 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 will be
	sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months. The future of the Company beyond that point is largely dependent on its ability to finance its operations through additional capital raising transactions and collaborations.
	Although the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The Company may seek additional funding through sales of equity or convertible
	debt securities or additional collaboration agreements. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company&#146;s security holders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve
	agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting the Company&#146;s ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. The Company may not be able to enter into
	additional collaboration arrangements. The Company&#146;s inability to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies. The Company could be forced to curtail the
	development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of its other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase its

	On September&nbsp;4, 2015, the Company&#146;s board of directors authorized the Company to file a confidential draft registration statement

	these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, the recognition of research and development expenses and the valuation of common and incentive units. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of
	changes in circumstances, facts and experiences. Actual results may differ materially from management&#146;s estimates, judgments and assumptions.

	The Company classifies fair value based measurements using a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This
	hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1, quoted market prices in active markets for identical
	assets or liabilities; Level 2, observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 such as quoted market prices for markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data;
	and Level 3, unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques

	temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
	The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including recent earnings results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available and other relevant factors. The
	Company records changes in the required valuation allowance in the period that the determination is made.

	information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company does not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company records interest and penalties related to
	uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense.

	The Company evaluates
	multiple-element arrangements to determine (i)&nbsp;the deliverables included in the arrangement and (ii)&nbsp;whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of
	accounting. When deliverables are separable, consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit. When the
	Company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, the Company must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. This evaluation requires
	the Company to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that (i)&nbsp;the
	delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii)&nbsp;if the arrangement includes a general right of return with respect to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and
	substantially in the Company&#146;s control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, the Company considers factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the
	availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the collaboration partner can use any other deliverable for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverable,
	whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item, and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered items.

	evidence of selling price if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available; or best estimate of selling price, if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party

	accounting, the Company considers applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. The Company validates the best estimate

	The Company recognizes arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition
	criteria are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, the Company recognizes revenue from the combined unit of accounting over the contractual or estimated
	performance period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of the Company&#146;s research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then
	the Company recognizes revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over which the service is provided to the
	customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then the Company recognizes revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative

	of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the Company&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (ii)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (iii)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative
	to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone and the level of
	effort and investment required to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is
	substantive. The Company will recognize revenue in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of any substantive milestones, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive are recognized as
	earned if there are no remaining performance obligations or over the remaining period of performance, with a cumulative catch-up being recognized for the elapsed portion of the period of performance, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria

	CRISPR/Cas9-related patents and applications owned, controlled or licensed by Caribou, as well as companion diagnostics to the Company&#146;s products or product candidates. This license agreement also includes any CRISPR/Cas9-related intellectual

	Pursuant

	In exchange for

	that was the original party to the license agreement with Caribou and otherwise had no other assets or operations prior to being merged with and into the Company in July&nbsp;2014. In addition, the Company is paying Caribou $5.0 million over the
	term of the two-year services agreement and agreed to pay 30.0% of Caribou&#146;s patent prosecution, filing, and maintenance costs for such licensed intellectual property under the license agreement, amounting to $1.1 million paid through
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. The Company granted Caribou an exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to any CRISPR/Cas9 patents and know-how for research, development and commercialization activities in Caribou&#146;s retained field of use owned or

	through December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company recorded $6.1&nbsp;million as in-process research and development expense within the statement of operations, which represents the fair value of the license received from Caribou. The $6.1 million expense
	includes $4.1 million associated with the fair value of the Junior Preferred Units issued to Caribou and $2.0 million in committed cash payments under the services agreement, which were determined to be allocable to the value of the licenses
	received. The remaining $3.0 million in committed cash payments related to the services agreement are being recorded as research and development expense as the services are provided. For the period from May&nbsp;7, 2014 (inception) through
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company recorded $0.3&nbsp;million and $1.5 million, respectively, in research and development expense for services provided under the Caribou services agreement. The Company

	Units&#148;), which converted to Series A-2, Series A-1 and Junior preferred stock upon the Reorganization. In August 2015, the Company issued Series B preferred stock (with the Series A-2, Series A-1 and Junior preferred stock, collectively

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2014, the Company entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Novartis focused on the
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	development of new CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies using chimeric antigen receptor T cells (&#147;CAR T cells&#148;) and hematopoietic stem cells (&#147;HSCs&#148;).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of the collaboration, the Company and Novartis may research potential therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative applications of
	the CRISPR/Cas9 platform in HSCs and CAR T cells. Within the HSC therapeutic space, Novartis may obtain exclusive rights to a limited number of HSC targets, to be selected by Novartis in a series of selection windows, the last of which closes 90
	days before the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the collaboration agreement. If Novartis does not exercise its selection rights within each selection window, any such rights will be deemed forfeited by Novartis. Novartis is required to
	use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop or commercialize at least one HSC product directed to at least one of their selected HSC targets.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company also agreed to collaborate with Novartis on research activities for CAR T cell targets under a research plan agreed upon by both
	parties. After completion of the research and development activities contemplated by the CAR T cell program research plan, Novartis will assume sole responsibility for developing any products arising from that research plan and will be responsible
	for additional costs and expenses of developing, manufacturing and commercializing selected research targets. Novartis is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop or commercialize at least one CAR T cell product directed
	to at least one of their selected CAR T cell targets.

	In the last two years of the collaboration term, Novartis will have the option to select a
	limited number of targets for research, development and commercialization of
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	therapies. Novartis is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop or commercialize at least one

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company received an upfront technology access payment from Novartis of $10.0 million in January&nbsp;2015 and is entitled to additional
	technology access fees of $20.0 million and quarterly research payments of $1.0 million, or up to $20.0 million in the aggregate, during the five-year research term. For each product under the collaboration, the Company may be eligible to receive
	(i) up to $30.3 million in development milestones, including for the filing of an investigational new drug application and for the dosing of the first patient in each of Phase IIa, Phase IIb and Phase III clinical trials, (ii) up to $50.0 million in
	regulatory milestones for the product&#146;s first indication, including regulatory approvals in the United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;) and European Union (&#147;EU&#148;), (iii) up to $50.0 million in regulatory milestones for the product&#146;s
	second indication, if any, including U.S. and EU regulatory approvals, (iv) royalties on net sales in the mid-single digits, and (v) net sales milestone payments of up to $100.0 million. The Company may also be eligible to receive payments for:
	(i)&nbsp;each additional HSC target selected by Novartis beyond its initial defined allocation, (ii)&nbsp;each
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	target that Novartis selects and (iii)&nbsp;any exercise by Novartis of certain license options under the agreement.
	Additionally, at the inception of the arrangement, Novartis invested $9.0&nbsp;million to purchase the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A-1 and Class&nbsp;A-2 Preferred Units. At date of issuance of the Class&nbsp;A-1 and A-2 Preferred Units in September
	and December 2014, the difference between the cash proceeds received from Novartis for the units and the $11.6 million estimated fair value of those units at date of issuance was determined to be $2.6 million.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The fixed portion of consideration under the collaboration arrangement was determined to be the $30.0&nbsp;million of total technology access
	fees, for which there are no contingent terms. From that amount, the Company allocated $2.6 million to the preferred units purchased by Novartis to record those units based on their fair value at date of issuance. As a result, during the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company recorded an increase of $2.6 million to the carrying value its Class&nbsp;A-1 and A-2 Preferred Units and a corresponding decrease to the deferred revenue initially recorded in connection with the collaboration
	agreement with Novartis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The significant deliverables of this multiple-element revenue arrangement were determined to be licenses CAR T
	cell and HSC targets and the associated research activities for these programs. The Company further determined that the licenses and associated research activities and joint steering committee participation did not have standalone value due to the
	specialized nature of the services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable, and, accordingly, the license and services are treated as a single unit of accounting.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Net of the $2.6 million allocation, the fixed portion of consideration under the arrangement of $27.4&nbsp;million is being recognized as
	collaboration revenue over the five-year performance period of the arrangement. As consideration for reimbursement of research and development activities is received, the Company is recognizing as collaboration revenue the portion of those payments
	representing the percentage of the performance period then completed. The remaining consideration is being recognized over the remaining portion of the five-year performance period on a straight-line basis. During the year ended December&nbsp;31,
	2015, the Company recorded revenue of $6.0 million related to the collaboration agreement with Novartis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, deferred revenue under the Novartis arrangement was $10.3 million. There was no deferred revenue related to this
	arrangement as of December&nbsp;31, 2014.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	From inception through July 2015, the Company issued equity-based compensation awards in the form of common units or
	incentive units. In connection with the Reorganization, holders of the outstanding common units received one share of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. Founder Stock, and holders of the outstanding incentive units received restricted shares of common
	stock of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. There was no incremental compensation recognized from the conversion that occurred as a result of the Reorganization.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Each share of Founder Stock and each share of restricted common stock entitles the holder to one vote for each share of common stock into which
	each share is convertible on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company&#146;s stockholders. Founder stock and restricted stock holders are entitled to dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors, subject to the preferential rights
	of other preferred stockholders.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These awards primarily vest as to 25% of the total units on the first anniversary of the vesting
	commencement date and then monthly, at the end of each subsequent month, over three years. The Company generally grants equity-based awards with service conditions only. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had reserved 1,128,717 shares for
	future grant. In February 2016, the Company increased the number of shares reserved for future grant by 1,529,411 shares.

	Section&nbsp;145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;DGCL&#148;) authorizes a corporation to indemnify its directors and
	officers against liabilities arising out of actions, suits and proceedings to which they are made or threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that they have served or are currently serving as a director or officer to a corporation. The
	indemnity may cover expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the director or officer in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding. Section&nbsp;145
	permits corporations to pay expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred by directors and officers in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding. In addition, Section&nbsp;145 provides that a corporation has the power
	to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of its directors and officers against any liability asserted against them and incurred by them in their capacity as a director or officer, or arising out of their status as such, whether or not the
	corporation would have the power to indemnify the director or officer against such liability under Section&nbsp;145.

	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Act, may be permitted to directors,
	officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
	expressed in the Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the
	Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
	matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
	issue.
