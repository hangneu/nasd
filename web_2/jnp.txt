	Consolidated Financial Statements to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

	The revenue related errors
	relate to the determination that a portion of the invoice price of product sold under our supply agreement with Ares Trading S.A. (an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (&#147;Merck KGaA&#148;)) is considered contingent, and therefore not
	fixed or determinable at the time of shipment. Our previous practice was to record revenue at the time of shipment based on the invoice price, with an adjustment to increase or decrease revenue upon completion of the quarterly reconciliation
	process. Accordingly, correction of the revenue errors will result in a timing difference for the contingent portion of revenue from our original methodology. We currently expect that, under the corrected methodology, revenue will be recognized in
	the period product is shipped to Merck KGaA for the fixed portion only (direct manufacturing cost plus 20%) with the contingent portion of the invoice price initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized upon completion of a
	quarterly reconciliation process that occurs after receiving sell-through information from Merck KGaA on a country-by-country basis.

	Additionally, we have a contract related to a COL-1077 clinical trial which has been in place since May 2015. During the course of compiling
	our results for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, we identified certain research and development expenses which had been incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, which had not been properly recorded in the periods to which the
	expenses related. The restatement reflects the recognition of additional research and development expense in the affected period, with corresponding adjustments to prepaid expenses and other current assets, and accrued expenses related to those
	amounts. The additional research and development expenses incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 were incurred during the three month period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The balances of prepaid expenses and other current assets and
	accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 have been restated to reflect these corrections.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	connection with the restatement, the Company also recorded adjustments for certain other amounts which were previously concluded to be immaterial.&nbsp;Those adjustments include: 1) an adjustment to record additional income tax expense during the
	year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and a corresponding adjustment to reduce income tax expense in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014; 2)&nbsp;an adjustment to increase cost of product revenues for the three month period ended September&nbsp;30,
	2015 and a corresponding adjustment to reduce cost of product revenues for the same amount in the three month period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 as reflected in our footnote containing unaudited quarterly information.&nbsp;Accordingly, the
	adjustment to cost of product revenues did not have an impact on the twelve months ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of the
	corrections, we have restated certain amounts in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 as well as unaudited quarterly financial information for each quarter in
	the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. There were also similar types of errors identified as affecting the Company&#146;s previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years prior to 2013. Accordingly, we are including restated
	consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 in the &#147;Selected Financial Data&#148; table of this Form 10-K/A. Adjustments prior to January 1, 2013 have been recognized as a cumulative
	adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K/A. These corrections also result in the restatement of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters
	ended March&nbsp;31, 2016 and June&nbsp;30, 2016. We will file amended Forms 10-Q with respect to the first and second quarters of 2016 to address the corrections.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management has reassessed its evaluation of the effectiveness
	of its internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on the framework established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
	Commission. As a result of that reassessment, management identified material weaknesses and, accordingly, has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Management
	has restated its report on internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. For a description of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and actions taken, and to be taken, to address the material
	weaknesses, see Part II, Item&nbsp;9A. &#147;Controls and Procedures&#148; of this 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A. In addition, our auditors have restated their report on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting and issued an

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This Annual Report on Form 10-K/A (&#147;Annual Report&#148;) contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties.
	Generally, forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as &#147;may,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;potential,&#148;

	that a statement is not forward-looking.&nbsp;All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future &#150; including statements relating to our future operating or financial
	performance or events, our strategy, goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, our liquidity and capital resources, and our product development &#150; are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these
	forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Our Company undertakes no
	obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain known and unknown
	risks, uncertainties and factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our Company&#146;s historical experience and our present expectations or projections.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions, and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we
	make. We have included important risk factors in the cautionary statements included in this Annual Report, particularly in Part 1 &#150; Item&nbsp;1A and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;)
	that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make.

	OVERVIEW
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a women&#146;s health therapeutic company focused on developing therapeutics that address unmet medical needs in women&#146;s health.
	Our marketed product and product development programs utilize our proprietary drug delivery technologies, which we believe are suited to applications in women&#146;s health. These technologies consist of our bioadhesive delivery system
	(&#147;BDS&#148;), a polymer designed to adhere to epithelial surfaces or mucosa and achieve sustained and controlled delivery of active drug product, and our novel intra-vaginal ring (&#147;IVR&#148;) technology, a multi-segment IVR.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead product candidate, COL-1077, is an investigational 10% lidocaine bioadhesive vaginal gel intended for use as a local anesthetic for
	pain from minimally invasive gynecological procedures. We expect to announce the results of our ongoing Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of COL-1077 in the third quarter of 2016. We are also advancing three preclinical product development programs
	utilizing our IVR technology, which target overactive bladder, hormone replacement therapy in women, and prevention of preterm birth.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Historically, we have developed and brought to market several prescription and &#147;over the counter&#148; pharmaceutical products. We
	currently receive revenues from CRINONE
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	, an 8% progesterone bioadhesive vaginal gel designed for progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an assisted reproductive technology
	(&#147;ART&#148;) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency. We supply CRINONE to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, (&#147;Merck KGaA&#148;) internationally, and sold the rights to CRINONE to Allergan, plc (&#147;Allergan&#148;) in
	the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Through our subsidiary, Juniper Pharma Services (&#147;JPS&#148;) we also offer a range of sophisticated technical
	services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry on a fee-for-services basis. Within our services offering, we provide our customers expertise on the characterization, development and manufacturing of small molecule compounds. Our services
	model allows us to take our customers drug candidates from early development through to Phase 2 clinical trials manufacturing. We also support our customers with advanced analytical and consulting services for intellectual property issues and we
	have particular expertise in problem solving for challenging compounds that are considered &#147;difficult to progress&#148;.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are
	applying the cash-flow generated from our CRINONE franchise and JPS to substantially fund the development of new therapeutic product candidates using our proprietary drug delivery technologies. We believe this strategy positions us well for
	capital-efficient growth as we advance these programs into clinical development. Internally-funded research and development expenditures were $7.0 million, $0.7 million and $0 for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,
	respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect to seek approval in the United States for our current pipeline of product candidates via the 505(b)(2) regulatory
	pathway. The 505(b)(2) pathway enables a potentially shorter development timeline compared to the development time for drugs that are new chemical entities by allowing us to rely, in part, on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#146;s
	(&#147;FDA&#146;s&#148;) prior findings of safety and efficacy for a previously approved product, or published literature, in support of our new drug applications (&#147;NDAs&#148;).

	Bioadhesive Delivery System
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our BDS is a
	unique drug delivery technology that facilitates binding to mucosal surfaces (buccal and vaginal areas) upon administration, and allows release of the active drug in a controlled and sustained manner until the BDS gel is discharged upon normal cell
	turnover. This occurs every three to five days for the vaginal epithelium, and up to every 24 hours for the oral mucosa. Our BDS is utilized in both CRINONE and COL-1077.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The key BDS ingredient is polycarbophil, which is a non-immunogenic, hypo-allergenic, bioadhesive polymer. Polycarbophil bonds to the cells of
	the body&#146;s mucosal surfaces upon administration. This happens because polycarbophil mimics negatively charged mucin, the glycoprotein component of mucus that is responsible for its attachment to underlying epithelial surfaces.

	In March
	2015, we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to the intellectual property rights for a novel segmented IVR technology. Due to its novel polymer and segmentation composition, we believe our IVR has the potential to deliver one or more drugs,
	including hormones and larger molecules such as peptides, at different dosages and release rates within a single segmented ring. Drugs such as progesterone and leuprolide have already been tested using the technology and demonstrated sustained
	release for up to three weeks.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Currently marketed intravaginal rings utilize a polymer membrane to control the delivery of a single drug to the patient from the ring. The two
	membrane ring types in use are reservoir-type and sandwich type. Reservoir rings utilize a drug-loaded core that is encapsulated by a polymer membrane and sandwich-type rings utilize a drug-loaded layer between a core, typically silicone, and a
	polymer membrane. The inherent risk associated with membrane rings is &#147;drug dumping&#148; which occurs if the membrane ruptures or tears.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	By contrast, our IVR has a solid homogenous cross-section with drug and specific excipients distributed within an ethylene vinyl acetate
	(&#147;EVA&#148;) polymer. The ring is manufactured using hot melt extrusion with no drug reservoirs or layers and active drug is released to the patient by diffusions through the polymer.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Reservoir and sandwich type rings are limited in the size of molecules, typically small molecules, they are able to deliver due to the use of a
	polymer membrane. By contrast, to date, no molecular weight limit has been identified for our IVR, and preclinical and clinical studies, such as a study by Kimball et al, submitted to

	In a Phase 1 clinical trial, our IVR was used to
	administer leuprolide, a nine amino acid peptide and serum leuprolide levels rose within eight hours to levels typically seen following parenteral injections. This was the first demonstration of trans-epithelial delivery of leuprolide across the
	vaginal mucosa, and provided proof of concept demonstrating that we could achieve therapeutic levels with our IVRs.

	To date, membrane rings have been limited to delivering a single drug at a single dosage range. Our IVR technology allows a ring to be designed
	to deliver one or more drugs in a single ring using specific drug segments with each segment designed based on its own dose delivery criteria. Each segment is specifically designed and produced using hot melt extrusion and the segmented ring is

	Lidocaine is a drug substance approved by the FDA for use on skin or on ocular surfaces as a topical local anesthetic. Intravenous lidocaine
	solutions (0.4%, 0.8%, 1%, and 2%) are approved in the United States for use in the management of ventricular arrhythmias (abnormal rapid heartbeat). Lidocaine acts by temporarily blocking a pain signal pathway along nerves by stopping the sodium
	from entering the nerve ending at the site of the pain. This mechanism prevents an electrical signal from passing a pain message to the brain.

	a single, self-administered dose approximately six hours prior to a scheduled gynecological procedure. COL-1077 adheres to the vaginal epithelium and provides sustained release of lidocaine into the endometrium to myometrium. This deep local tissue
	penetration is enabled by the BDS technology underlying COL-1077. The analgesic effect of COL-1077 is expected to last several hours, with peak concentration at approximately six hours post-dose, allowing patients to arrive at the physician office

	Initial proof of concept for JNP-0101 was provided by multiple peer reviewed publications on the safety and efficacy of a once-monthly

	While there are nearly 40 FDA-approved HRT products on the market, the HRT combination therapies fall short. Currently, HRT combination
	therapies only occupy approximately 30% of the U.S. HRT market. All FDA-approved HRT combination products contain synthetic progestin rather than natural progesterone while recent studies suggest fewer cardiovascular adverse events are associated
	with natural progestogens. In addition, all current combination HRT products are orally administered, which cause extensive fist pass metabolism and require daily dosing.

	hormone replacement therapy formulation, route of administration, and the timing of therapy produces different biologic effects. We expect that as a result of the 2012 NAMS Statement, the percentage of the approximately 45&nbsp;million American

	We and our commercial partners compete against established pharmaceutical companies who market products and services addressing the same
	markets and patient needs. Further, numerous companies are developing, or may develop, enhanced delivery systems, products and services that compete with our present and proposed products and services. It is possible that we may not have the
	resources to withstand these and other competitive forces. Some of these competitors possess greater financial, research and technical resources than us or our partners. Moreover, these companies may possess greater marketing capabilities than we or

	The pharmaceutical industry is subject to
	change as new delivery technologies are developed, new products enter the market, regulatory requirements change, generic versions of available drugs become available and treatment paradigms evolve to reflect these and other medical research
	discoveries. We face significant competition in all areas of our business. The rapid pace of change in the pharmaceutical industry continually creates new opportunities for competitors and start-ups and can quickly render existing products,
	technologies and services less valuable. Customer requirements and physician and patient preferences continually change as new treatment options emerge, are more or less heavily promoted, and become less expensive. As a result, our partners may not
	gain, and may lose, market share.

	On March&nbsp;27, 2015 we entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital (&#147;MGH&#148;) pursuant to

	Unless earlier terminated by the parties, the license agreement will remain in effect until the later of (i)&nbsp;the date on which all issued

	date referred to in (i), whichever is earlier. We have the right to terminate the license agreement by giving 90 day advance written notice to MGH. MGH has the right to terminate the license agreement based on our failure to make payments due under
	the license agreement, subject to a 15 day cure period, or our failure to maintain the insurance required by the license agreement. MGH may also terminate the license agreement based on our non-financial default under the license agreement, subject

	The patent positions for pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain

	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#147;FDCA&#148;) and
	its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and subsequently maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign
	statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or following approval, may

	GLP regulations. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, an IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests and nonclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any
	available clinical data or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. In the case of 505(b)(2) applications, though, some of the IND components may not be required. Some nonclinical testing

	the clinical trial or a central IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, informed consent forms, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks
	to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being
	conducted. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRB for approval. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be
	submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the

	where at least one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the

	Section&nbsp;505 of
	the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section&nbsp;505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and
	efficacy. A Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA is an application in which the applicant, in part, relies on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the
	person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Section&nbsp;505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application
	(&#147;ANDA&#148;). An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a
	previously approved product. Limited changes must be pre-approved by the FDA via a suitability petition. ANDAs are termed &#147;abbreviated&#148; because they are generally not required to include nonclinical and clinical data to establish safety
	and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the
	same amount of active ingredients into a subject&#146;s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.

	In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required
	to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant&#146;s product and method of use. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic
	Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.

	Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA
	referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make patent certifications to the FDA that: (1)&nbsp;no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2)&nbsp;the patent has
	expired; (3)&nbsp;the date on which the patent has expired and approval will not be sought until after the patent expiration; or (4)&nbsp;the patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for
	which the application is submitted. The last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant
	challenges a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification or if the applicant is not seeking approval of a patented method of use. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a
	patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

	If the competitor has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification
	to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner within 20 days after the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to
	the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of
	30&nbsp;months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition

	provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDA provides periods of regulatory exclusivity, which provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the

	or clathrate, of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review and approve an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the

	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of
	an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity period described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that
	fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#146;s request, the
	additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection
	cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents.

	Sales of any

	questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be

	The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its
	behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of,
	any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value.
	The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and
	regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or
	recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se
	illegal under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the
	Federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the &#147;Affordable Care Act&#148;), to a stricter standard such that
	a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services
	resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative
	civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for
	healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this
	area, it is possible that our future business activities, including our sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with healthcare providers might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us.

	The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to
	federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. This statute has been interpreted to prohibit presenting claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims
	for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#147;cause&#148; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for
	example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of
	prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example,
	pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government,
	plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating
	these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the Federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted

	Payment or reimbursement of prescription drugs by

	between the states and the federal government and Medicaid payment rates for the drug. For drugs paid under Medicare Part B, manufacturers must also calculate and report their Average Sales Price, which is used to determine the Medicare Part B
	payment rate for the drug. Drugs that are approved under an NDA, including 505(b)(2) drugs, are subject to an additional inflation penalty which can substantially increase rebate payments. In addition, for NDA drugs, the Veterans Health Care Act
	(&#147;VHCA&#148;), requires manufacturers to calculate and report to the Veterans Administration (&#147;VA&#148;), a different price called the Non-Federal Average Manufacturing Price, which is used to determine the maximum price that can be
	charged to certain federal agencies, referred to as the Federal Ceiling Price (&#147;FCP&#148;). Like the Medicaid rebate amount, the FCP includes an inflation penalty. A Department of Defense regulation requires manufacturers to provide this

	defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers
	of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#146; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal
	civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

	The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services in exchange for state
	Medicaid coverage of most of the manufacturer&#146;s drugs. The Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers&#146; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic
	Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs to 23.1% of average manufacturer price (&#147;AMP&#148;) and adding a new rebate calculation for &#147;line extensions&#148; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid

	The Affordable Care Act expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing. In addition, because 340B pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, the revisions to the
	Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. The Affordable Care Act imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of

	Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the
	United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with
	recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes
	aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama
	signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations
	period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely

	Our clinical trials compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same
	therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition reduces the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our
	competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which reduces the number of patients who are available for our
	clinical trials in such clinical trial site. Delays in patient enrollment in the future as a result of these and other factors may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our clinical trials, which could prevent us from

	Even if we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates in the United States, the FDA may still impose significant
	restrictions on a product&#146;s indicated uses or marketing or to the conditions for approval, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials or post-market surveillance. As a
	condition to granting marketing approval of a product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. The results generated in these post-approval clinical trials could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product
	labeling, or new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product. For example, the labeling for our hormone therapy product candidates, if approved, may include restrictions on use or warnings. The Food and Drug Administration
	Amendments Act of 2007 (&#147;FDAAA&#148;), gives the FDA enhanced post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with
	FDA-approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (&#147;REMS) programs. If approved, our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety
	surveillance, advertising, promotion, record keeping, and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The FDA&#146;s exercise of its authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and
	regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on sales of approved products. Foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable costs.
	Post-marketing studies, whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other emerging data about marketed products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect sales of our product
	candidates once approved, and potentially our other marketed products. Further, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have
	an adverse effect on sales of our approved products. Accordingly, new data about our products could negatively affect demand because of real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product
	withdrawal or recall. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, and practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases or
	conditions to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of our products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of our products.

	The holder of an approved NDA also is subject to obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to

	In addition,
	notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section&nbsp;505(b)(2), in the past some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA&#146;s interpretation of Section&nbsp;505(b)(2). For example, parties have
	filed citizen petitions objecting to the FDA approving a Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA on both scientific and legal and regulatory grounds. Scientific arguments have included the assertions that for the FDA to determine the similarity of the drug in
	the 505(b)(2) NDA to the listed drug, the agency would need to reference proprietary manufacturing information or trade secrets in the listed drug&#146;s NDA; that it would be scientifically inappropriate for the FDA to rely on public or nonpublic
	information about the listed drug because it differs in various ways from the drug in the 505(b)(2) NDA; or that differences between the listed drug and the drug in the 505(b)(2) NDA may impair the latter&#146;s safety and effectiveness.&nbsp;Legal
	and regulatory arguments have included the assertion that Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDAs must contain a full report of investigations conducted on the drug proposed for approval, and that approving a drug through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway would
	lower the approval standards.&nbsp;In addition, citizen petitions have made patent-based challenges against 505(b)(2) NDAs.&nbsp;For example, petitioners have asserted that the FDA should refuse to file a 505(b)(2) NDA unless it references a
	specific NDA as the listed drug, because it is &#147;most similar&#148; to the proposed drug, and provides appropriate patent certification to all patents listed for that NDA; or that when a 505(b)(2) NDA is pending before the agency, but before it
	is approved, where the FDA approves an NDA for a drug that is pharmaceutically equivalent to the drug that is the subject of the 505(b)(2) NDA, then the FDA should require that the 505(b)(2) NDA be resubmitted referencing the approved NDA as the
	listed drug and certifying to the listed patents for that approved drug. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and launch of COL-1077 or any
	future product candidates we may develop.

	In addition, in September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing
	authority including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. The FDA&#146;s exercise of
	this authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to ensure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on the sale and/or
	distribution of approved products. Other legislative and regulatory initiatives have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. For example, the Drug Supply Chain
	Security Act of 2013 imposes new obligations on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance
	documents or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly

	In

	may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner. Any failings by these third parties may compromise our clinical trials in particular or our business in

	Competitors may infringe our patents or

	unenforceable, or both. In any patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the

	Even if we prevail in our infringement action, the court may decide not to grant an injunction
	against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there
	is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities
	analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file
	and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific
	personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.

	Our commercial success depends, in part, on our and our strategic partner&#146;s ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product

	There is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the pharmaceutical industry, and we may become party to, or threatened
	with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on
	existing or future intellectual property rights. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The pharmaceutical industry has produced a significant number of patents,
	and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform.
	If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may
	not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are
	successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could significantly harm our business and operating results.
	In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.

	If we are found to infringe a third
	party&#146;s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from
	such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
	Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and
	attorneys&#146; fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could have a material
	adverse effect on our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.

	While we have obtained composition of matter
	patents with respect to some of our product candidates, we also rely on trade secret protection for certain aspects of our technology platform, including certain aspects of our formulation and device development expertise and know-how. We seek to
	protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, consultants, independent contractors, advisors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and
	other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with employees and certain consultants. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our
	proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and

	Moreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign
	intellectual property laws. Additionally, laws of some countries outside of the United States and Europe do not afford intellectual property protection to the same extent as the laws of the United States and Europe. Many companies have encountered
	significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, including India, China and other developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and
	other intellectual property rights. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, certain foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws
	under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties under certain circumstances. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in certain countries outside the United States and Europe.
	Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, if our ability to
	enforce our patents to stop infringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.

	On October&nbsp;18, 2016, during the course of responding to a comment letter from the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we
	determined that our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 through December&nbsp;31, 2015, including the unaudited consolidated financial information for each quarterly period within the fiscal
	years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March&nbsp;10, 2016 and amended on April&nbsp;22, 2016, should no longer be relied upon due to an error identified therein, and that a restatement of
	these financial statements is required.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The revenue related errors relate to the determination that a portion of the invoice price of
	product sold under our supply agreement with Ares Trading S.A. (an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (&#147;Merck KGaA&#148;)) is considered contingent, and therefore not fixed or determinable at the time of shipment. Our previous practice
	was to record revenue at the time of shipment based on the invoice price, with an adjustment to increase or decrease revenue upon completion of the quarterly reconciliation process. Accordingly, correction of the revenue errors will result in a
	timing difference for the contingent portion of revenue from our original methodology. We currently expect that, under the corrected methodology, revenue will be recognized in the period product is shipped to Merck KGaA for the fixed portion only
	(direct manufacturing cost plus 20%) with the contingent portion of the invoice price initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized upon completion of a quarterly reconciliation process that occurs after receiving sell-through
	information from Merck KGaA on a country-by-country basis.

	Additionally, we have a contract related to a COL-1077 clinical trial which
	has been in place since May 2015. During the course of compiling our results for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, we identified certain research and development expenses which had been incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015
	which had not been properly recorded in the periods to which the expenses related. The restatement reflects the recognition of additional research and development expense in the affected periods, with corresponding adjustments to prepaid expenses
	and other current assets, and accrued expenses related to those amounts. The additional research and development expenses incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 were incurred during the three month period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.
	The balances of prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 have been restated to reflect these corrections.
</P>

	In connection with the restatement, the Company also recorded adjustments for certain other amounts which were previously concluded to be
	immaterial.&nbsp;Those adjustments include: 1) an adjustment to record additional income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2013 and a corresponding adjustment to reduce income tax expense in the year ended December 31, 2014; 2) an
	adjustment to increase cost of product revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 and a corresponding adjustment to reduce cost of product revenues for the same amount in the three month period ended December 31, 2015 as reflected
	in our footnote containing unaudited quarterly information.&nbsp;Accordingly, the adjustment to cost of product revenues did not have an impact on the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.

	NDA 22-139 to Allergan pursuant to the second closing of our sale of assets to Allergan under the Purchase and Collaboration Agreement. On February&nbsp;24, 2012, Allergan received a Complete Response Letter (&#147;CRL&#148;), from the FDA
	indicating that the review cycle for NDA 22-139 was complete but the application was not ready for approval in its present form. The CRL stated that the effect of treatment with progesterone vaginal gel 8% in reducing the risk of preterm birth in

	continued discussions with the FDA to determine a viable pathway forward and in August 2012 filed a Formal Dispute Resolution Request (&#147;FDRR&#148;) related to this application. The FDA denied Allergan&#146;s FDRR in October 2012. Allergan

	On March&nbsp;27, 2015 we entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital (&#147;MGH&#148;) pursuant to
	which we licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to MGH&#146;s patent rights in a novel IVR technology for the delivery of one or more pharmaceuticals at different dosages and release rates in a single segmented ring.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Unless earlier terminated by the parties, the license agreement will remain in effect until the later of (i)&nbsp;the date on which all issued
	patents and filed patent applications within the licensed patent rights have expired or been abandoned and (ii)&nbsp;one year after the last sale for which a royalty is due under the license agreement or 10&nbsp;years after such expiration or
	abandonment date referred to in (i), whichever is earlier. We have the right to terminate the license agreement by giving 90 day advance written notice to MGH. MGH has the right to terminate the license agreement based on our failure to make
	payments due under the license agreement, subject to a 15 day cure period, or our failure to maintain the insurance required by the license agreement. MGH may also terminate the license agreement based on our non-financial default under the license
	agreement, subject to a 60 day cure period.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we have agreed to reimburse MGH for all costs
	associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights and have agreed to pay MGH a $50,000 annual license fee on each of the first five year anniversaries of the effective date of the license, and a
	$100,000 annual license fee beginning on the sixth anniversary of the effective date of the license and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter. The annual license fee is creditable against any royalties or sublicense income payable in each
	calendar year.

	Under the terms of the license agreement, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and
	commercialize at least one product and/or process related to the IVR technology, which efforts will include the making of certain minimum annual expenditures in each of the first five years following the effective date of the license. We have also
	agreed to pay MGH certain milestone payments totaling up to $1,200,000 tied to our achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones, and certain annual royalty payments based on net sales of any such patented products or processes
	developed by us.

	In March 2013, we entered into a lease agreement for our new facilities in Boston. The new lease provided a significant cost saving to the Company as compared to our lease in Livingston, which expired in October 2013. We incurred a charge of $0.7

	revenues from royalty stream and certain other revenues. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we derived approximately 71% of our revenues from the sale of our products, 13% from the sale of our services and 16% of our revenues from royalty
	stream and certain other revenues. Generally, we recognize revenues from the sales of our products at the time the goods are shipped to customers, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Additionally, we recognize

	activities for COL-1077, a sustained-release vaginal lidocaine gel for which the target indication is an acute use anesthetic for minimally invasive gynecological procedures. In 2015, we entered into a phase 2b clinical trial for COL-1077. We are
	also advancing three preclinical product development programs that target overactive bladder, hormone replacement therapy in women, and prevention of preterm birth. In 2016, we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly

	We account for our warrants in accordance with &#147;ASC 815-40&#148; Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and

	specifies that we must deliver freely tradable shares upon exercise by the warrant holder. Because there are circumstances, irrespective of likelihood that they may not be within our control, that could prevent delivery of registered shares, ASC
	815-40 requires the warrants be recorded as a liability at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded as income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of our warrants is determined using a
	Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price, expected stock price volatility and contractual term. In 2009 we issued warrants to purchase 681,275 shares of common stock with an
	exercise price of $12.16 per share. These warrants expired in April 2015 and therefore, had no fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	allowances are provided if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the fourth quarter of 2014, it was determined that the utilization of our tax loss
	carryforwards in the United Kingdom was not likely to be realized based on updated forecasts and projections of product development efforts the Company is beginning to undertake. Consequently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our

	Total cost of revenues was $21.4 million and $17.7 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and
	2014, respectively. The increase in total cost of revenues in 2015 was largely driven by the resumption of shipments of CRINONE in a key market, in-market growth and entry into new markets. Accordingly, cost of product revenues increased due to a

	Product gross margin, including royalty income, decreased in 2015 as
	compared to 2014 due to the reduction in royalty income. Excluding the intellectual property sale, the product gross profit percentage would be 53% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. In addition, pricing discounts granted to Merck KGaA based
	on volume purchases pursuant to the license and supply agreement also contributed to the decline. Service gross margin increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to increased customer volumes and a change in mix of revenue type within the service
	segment.

	Research and development costs incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 were primarily associated
	with the development of COL-1077. These costs mainly consist of personnel-related expenses for employees directly involved in product development as well as professional service consultants. Drs. Robert Langer and William Crowley joined our Company
	as strategic advisors in March 2015 and we incurred $1.1 million of stock compensation expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 in connection with their engagement. As we continue to advance COL-1077 and other potential proprietary product
	programs, we expect corresponding increases in research and development costs.

	December&nbsp;31, 2015, compared with $8.6 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. This increase was attributable principally to costs associated with certain organizational changes within JPS, higher legal and audit expenses related to

	The 2015 tax expense represents state minimum taxes owed. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we determined that
	the utilization of our tax loss carryforwards in the United Kingdom was not likely to be realized. This was due to updated forecasts and projections on product development efforts the Company is beginning to undertake. Consequently, we have recorded
	a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in this jurisdiction, resulting in deferred tax expense of $0.5 million. The remainder of our 2014 tax expense represents federal alternative minimum tax, state minimum taxes owed, and a
	one-time clawback provision under a New Jersey Economic Development Authority program relating to the sale of our state net operating losses. Currently, we have a full valuation allowance offsetting our net domestic deferred tax asset.

	Product revenues decreased by approximately $1.4 million, or 7%, from the 2013 period primarily due to reduced shipments of CRINONE in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 to one of Merck KGaA&#146;s higher-volume,
	higher margin markets during a routine license renewal in that market. Revenue included $14.2&nbsp;million related to product shipped to Merck&nbsp;KGaA and $4.1&nbsp;million related to product sold through by Merck&nbsp;KGaA in the year ended

	Royalty revenues increased $2.5 million, or 65%, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 driven by the one-time benefit of $2.2 million from the sale of
	intellectual property rights and technology for Legatrin P.M. to Lil&#146; Drug Store and higher sales of progesterone products by Allergan. Royalty revenue associated with Legatrin P.M. in the 2013 period was $0.4 million as compared with $0.2
	million in the 2014 period prior to the sale. Due to the sale of the intellectual property rights of Legatrin P.M., we no longer expect any further revenues from this royalty stream.

	Total cost of revenues was $17.7 million and $13.3 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and
	2013, respectively. Cost of product revenues decreased due to a 2% reduction in units shipped in the 2014 period as compared to the 2013 period. Cost of service revenues consist mainly of personnel costs, external consultant fees, depreciation and
	materials used in connection with generating our service revenues. The increase in total cost of revenues in 2014 was driven by a full-year of service costs for our Nottingham operations versus a shortened period in 2013. Product gross margin
	increased in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to the $2.5 million increase in royalties in 2014 compared to 2013. Service gross margin decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to a change in mix of revenue type within the service segment. Fiscal year
	2013 had a higher concentration of clinical trial manufacturing revenue that generally carries a higher margin.

	Sales and marketing expenses incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 represented the
	sales and marketing activities associated with our services offerings, which we acquired in September 2013 with our acquisition of JPS. These expenses consist of personnel costs for our sales force as well as marketing costs consisting of tradeshows
	and conference fees. The increase was attributable to having a full year of service revenues in 2014 compared to three and one-half months of service revenues in 2013.

	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we determined that the utilization of our tax loss carryforwards in the United
	Kingdom was not likely to be realized. This was due to updated forecasts and projections on product development efforts the Company is beginning to undertake. Consequently, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets
	in this jurisdiction, resulting in deferred tax expense of $0.5 million. The remainder of our 2014 tax expense represents federal alternative minimum tax, state minimum taxes owed, and a one-time clawback provision under a New Jersey Economic
	Development Authority program relating to the sale of our state net operating losses. The 2013 tax expense represents state minimum tax expenses. Currently, we have a full valuation allowance offsetting our net domestic deferred tax asset.

	In September 2013, we assumed debt of $3.9 million in connection with our acquisition of JPS. JPS had entered
	into a Business Loan Agreement (&#147;Loan Agreement&#148;) covering three loan facilities with Lloyds TSB Bank (&#147;Lloyds&#148;) as administrative agent. JPS had drawn down $3.9 million under the Loan Agreement and as of December&nbsp;31, 2015
	owed a principal balance of $3.1 million. The three loan facilities are each repayable in monthly installments: one started repayment in February 2013, and the remaining two commenced in October 2013. All facilities are due for repayment over 15
	years from the date of drawdown. Two of the facilities bear interest at the Bank of England&#146;s base rate plus 1.95% and 2.55%, respectively. The interest rate at December&nbsp;31, 2015 for these two facilities was 2.45% and 3.05%, respectively.
	The third facility is a fixed rate agreement bearing interest at 3.52%&nbsp;per annum. The weighted average interest rate for the three loan facilities for the twelve&nbsp;months ending December&nbsp;31, 2015 was 3.00%. The Loan Agreement is secured
	by the mortgaged property and other assets of JPS. The Loan Agreement contains financial covenants that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur, requires us to maintain certain levels of net worth, and restricts our ability to materially alter
	the character of JPS&#146; business. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, JPS remained in compliance with all of the covenants under the Loan Agreement.

	In September 2013, we assumed a $2.5 million obligation under a grant arrangement with the Regional Growth Fund on behalf of the Secretary of
	State for Business, Innovation, and Skills in the United Kingdom. JPS used this grant to fund the building of their second facility, which includes analytical labs, office space, and a clinical manufacturing facility. As a part of the arrangement,
	JPS is required to create and maintain certain full-time equivalent personnel levels through October 2017. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we remained in compliance with the covenants of the arrangement.

	The income from the Regional Growth Fund will be recognized on a decelerated basis over the next two years. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the
	obligation is valued at $1.5 million and is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of other income on the obligation that will be recognized provided we remain in compliance with the covenants will be the

	and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These
	estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
	these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as of December 31, 2015 except as it relates to our policy for revenue recognition.

	from the sale of products are to be recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and
	collectibility is reasonably assured. Selling prices to Merck KGaA for CRINONE (progesterone gel) are determined on an annual and country-by-country basis and are the greater of (i)&nbsp;a percentage of Merck KGaA&#146;s net estimated selling price,
	or (ii)&nbsp;our direct manufacturing cost plus 20% and are invoiced to Merck KGaA upon shipment. We record revenue at the minimum selling price, which is our direct manufacturing cost plus 20% at the time of shipment to Merck KGaA as that amount is
	considered fixed or determinable. We record deferred revenue related to amounts invoiced above the minimum selling price. Upon receiving sell through information from Merck KGaA on a quarterly and country-by-country basis, we record an adjustment to
	increase revenue to reflect the difference between Merck KGaA&#146;s net selling price and the minimum price recorded at the time of shipment. Any difference between the amounts invoiced at Merck KGa&#146;s estimated net selling price and Merck
	KGaA&#146;s actual net selling price are billed or credited to Merck KGaA in the quarter the product is sold through by Merck KGaA. Accordingly, product revenue in each period includes both an amount for product shipped to Merck KGaA in the current
	period recognized at the minimum purchase price as well as an amount for product shipped by Merck KGaA to its customers in the current period equal to the difference between Merck KGaA&#146;s actual net selling price and the minimum purchase price.
	Merck KGaA is also entitled to a volume discount based on annual purchases. We record reserves against revenue on a quarterly basis to reflect the volume discount expected to be earned by Merck KGaA during the year.

	and are based on the direct salary of the employees on the engagement plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement, including any amounts billed to us by our vendors. The proportional performance method is used for fixed-price
	contracts because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made, based on historical experience and the terms set forth in the contract, and are indicative of the level of benefit
	provided to our clients. In the event of a termination, fixed-price contracts generally provide for payment for services rendered up to the termination date.

	Auxilium transactions allows product to be returned for a period that began three months prior to the product expiration date and ended twelve months after the product expiration date. Provisions for returns on sales to wholesalers, distributors and
	retail chain stores were estimated based on a percentage of sales, using such factors as historical sales information, distributor inventory levels and product prescription data, and were recorded as a reduction to sales in the same period as the
	related sales were recognized. We assumed that our customers were using the first-in, first-out method in filling orders so that the oldest saleable product was used first. We recorded a provision for returns on a quarterly basis using an estimated
	rate and adjusted the provision when necessary. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, there is no sales returns reserve as the return rights obligation has elapsed for all products for which we provided a right of return.

	On October&nbsp;18, 2016, during the course of responding to a comment letter from the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we
	determined that our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 through December&nbsp;31, 2015, including the unaudited consolidated financial information for each quarterly period within the fiscal
	years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March&nbsp;10, 2016 and amended on April&nbsp;22, 2016, should no longer be relied upon due to an error identified therein, and that a restatement of

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The revenue related errors relate to the determination that a portion of the invoice price of
	product sold under our supply agreement with Ares Trading S.A. (an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (&#147;Merck KGaA&#148;)) is considered contingent, and therefore not fixed or determinable at the time of shipment. Our previous practice
	was to record revenue at the time of shipment based on the invoice price, with an adjustment to increase or decrease revenue upon completion of the quarterly reconciliation process. Accordingly, correction of the revenue errors will result in a
	timing difference for the contingent portion of revenue from our original methodology. We currently expect that, under the corrected methodology, revenue will be recognized in the period product is shipped to Merck KGaA for the fixed portion only
	(direct manufacturing cost plus 20%) with the contingent portion of the invoice price initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized upon completion of a quarterly reconciliation process that occurs after receiving sell-through
	information from Merck KGaA on a country-by-country basis.

	Additionally, we have a contract related to a COL-1077 clinical trial which
	has been in place since May 2015. During the course of compiling our results for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, we identified certain research and development expenses which had been incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015
	which had not been properly recorded in the periods to which the expenses related. The restatement reflects the recognition of additional research and development expense in the affected periods, with corresponding adjustments to prepaid expenses
	and other current assets, and accrued expenses related to those amounts. The additional research and development expenses incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 were incurred during the three month period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.
	The balances of prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 have been restated to reflect these corrections.

	consolidated financial statements for the years prior to 2013. Accordingly, we are including restated consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 in the &#147;Selected Financial Data&#148;

	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
	Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
	reporting purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

	Under the supervision and with the
	participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 based on the guidelines
	established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.

	A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there
	is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

	In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and revised management&#146;s assessment of our internal controls
	over financial reporting at December&nbsp;31, 2015, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting associated with technical accounting review of significant contractual agreements as well as our monitoring of
	expenses incurred under our clinical research agreements. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain effective internal control over the assessment of the accounting for significant arrangements, including the timely assessment of revenue
	recognition; and the Company did not design and maintain effective internal control over the accounting for the completeness, accuracy, and presentation and disclosure over research and development expenses and related prepaid and accrual accounts.
	These material weaknesses resulted in the restatement described in Note 2 of our financial statements including the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the unaudited quarterly financial information for each quarter in the years ended
	December 31, 2015 and 2014, which are included in this Annual Report on Form

	We have not yet been able to remediate these material weaknesses. These actions are subject to ongoing review by
	our senior management, as well as oversight by the audit committee of our board of directors. Although we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we cannot, at this time, estimate when such remediation may occur, and our
	initiatives may not prove successful in remediating the material weaknesses. Management may determine to enhance other existing controls and/or implement additional controls as the implementation progresses. It will take time to determine whether
	the additional controls we are implementing will be sufficient to accomplish their intended purpose; accordingly, the material weaknesses may continue for a period of time. While the audit committee of our board of directors and senior management
	are closely monitoring this implementation, until the remediation efforts discussed in this section, including any additional remediation efforts that our senior management identifies as necessary, are complete, tested and determined effective, we
	will not be able to conclude that the material weaknesses have been remediated. In addition, we may need to incur incremental costs associated with this remediation, primarily due to the hiring and training of finance and accounting personnel, and
	the implementation and validation of improved accounting and financial reporting procedures.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
	obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit
	also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
	reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
	(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
	necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
	of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
	effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	Management revised its assessment of internal control over financial reporting due to the identification of material weaknesses, described in the following paragraph, in connection with the financial statement restatements. Accordingly, our opinion
	on the effectiveness of Juniper Pharmaceutical Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 expressed herein is different from that expressed in our previous report.

	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable

	development expenses and related prepaid and accrual accounts have been identified and described in management&#146;s revised assessment. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied

	the proposal. The Compensation Committee believes that this result affirms the stockholders&#146; support for the Company&#146;s approach to executive compensation, and, therefore, the Company did not make any changes to its approach to executive

	While the general mix of each compensation component is considered in the design of our total compensation
	program, the Compensation Committee does not target a specific mix of pay either in its program design or in its compensation determinations. By design, our executive officers have more variability in their compensation than non-executives, to more
	closely tie their compensation to the Company&#146;s overall performance. The Compensation Committee considers each element of total compensation offered by the Company against each element of total compensation provided by our peer group companies.

	We pay our executive

	The base salary levels of our executive officers may be increased from time to time to recognize external competitive compensation levels, internal pay equity, and individual contributions and performance.

	Generally, the Compensation Committee compares our executive officers&#146; base salaries with base salaries of individuals in comparable
	positions at the peer group companies. In connection with determining the base salary levels for the Company&#146;s executive officers, the Compensation Committee compares their total cash compensation (i.e. base salary plus target annual bonus) to
	total cash compensation of individuals in comparable positions at the peer group companies.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We maintain
	an annual cash incentive program (the &#147;Incentive Plan&#148;), the purpose of which is to motivate and reward the attainment of annual Company and individual performance goals. For our named executive officers, annual incentive opportunities,
	which are expressed as a percentage of base salary, can range from 0% to 150% of targeted levels, depending on the degree of attainment of pre-established Company goals and individual goals for the particular year. In order for any named executive
	officer to be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus, the Company must achieve 50% of the pre-established target corporate goals (as described below).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Actual payouts under the Incentive Plan are recommended by the Compensation Committee to the Board based on achievement of corporate goals,
	overall individual performance, and the broad discretion of the Compensation Committee and the Board. Our corporate goals are jointly established at the beginning of each year by management and the Compensation Committee and are approved by the
	Compensation Committee and the Board. Once the corporate goals are finalized and approved by the Board, they are clearly communicated to executives. Executives are aware of the overall bonus program, targets, annual goals, and performance measures
	that impact the annual bonus payout.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An equity compensation program is provided to all executives and certain key employees to foster a culture of ownership, align compensation
	with stockholder interests, and promote long-term retention with the organization. Each year the Compensation Committee determines the types of awards to be used for equity compensation. In doing so, the Compensation Committee considers the ability
	of each type of award to achieve key compensation objectives (such as employee retention, motivation, and attraction), the needs of the business, competitive market practices, dilution, and expense constraints, as well as tax and accounting
	implications.

	Stock options awarded under the Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2015 Long-Term Performance Plan (the &#147;2015 Plan&#148;)
	must be equal to or greater than the fair market value (i.e., the closing price) of the Company&#146;s Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant. Stock option grants are normally approved at Board and Compensation Committee
	meetings that are generally scheduled a year in advance. Scheduling decisions are made without regard to anticipated financial reporting dates or other major announcements by the Company.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Newly hired employees, including executive officers, may be granted options effective on the first day of employment, with such options
	having an exercise price set at the fair market value (i.e., the closing price) of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the employment start date. Our employees&#146; start dates are scheduled without regard to anticipated financial
	reporting dates or other major announcements by the Company.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have historically made an annual grant of employee stock options at the
	time of the annual review of each executive&#146;s performance, usually in February or early March of each year. Stock option grants typically vest over four years to provide an incentive for employees to remain with the Company and to increase
	stockholder value.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In determining the equity awards for 2015, the Compensation Committee concluded as follows: (1)&nbsp;the equity
	awards should be comparable to those provided by our peer group of companies; (2)&nbsp;the aggregate grants should be limited, so as not to exceed a predetermined dilution effect; and (3)&nbsp;the grants to executive officers should be within a
	range that is appropriate from a Company-wide internal fairness perspective.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on these determinations, on February 11, 2015, Mr.
	Condella was granted a stock option to purchase 40,000 shares, and Dr. Patel was granted a stock option to purchase 32, 000 shares. Each of the stock options granted to Mr. Condella and Dr. Patel vests in increments of 6.25% every three months
	beginning on the date that is three months after the grant date. Dr. Martell was granted a stock option to purchase 60,000 shares on January 6, 2015, in connection with her joining the Company. This option vests at a rate of 25% per year on each
	anniversary of the grant date.&nbsp;Mr. Elston received a new hire stock option grant in October 2014 and did not, therefore, receive a stock option grant in 2015.

	As noted elsewhere in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the Compensation Committee believes that it is important when making
	compensation decisions to be informed as to the current practices of comparable, publicly-held companies. In the late summer of 2015, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford Associates (&#147;Radford&#148;) as compensation consultants to provide

	Committee.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the Compensation Committee&#146;s request, Radford undertook a review of the Company&#146;s peer group and provided
	recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on their findings. Based, in part, on Radford&#146;s recommendations, the Compensation Committee revised the Company&#146;s peer group, based on the following key factors: market capitalization,
	industry focus (defined as commercial biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies), stage of development (defined as Phase 2 or Phase 3 products), revenue and number of employees.

	Section 162(m)
	of the Internal Revenue Code limits to $1 million the deductibility for federal income tax purposes of annual compensation paid by a publicly held company to its chief executive officer and its other named executive officers (other than its chief
	financial officer), unless certain conditions are met. To the extent feasible, we structure executive compensation to preserve deductibility for federal income tax purposes. In this regard, our equity incentive plans are designed to preserve, to the
	extent otherwise available, the deductibility of income realized pursuant to these plans. Nevertheless, we retain the flexibility to authorize compensation that may not be deductible if we believe it is in the best interest of the Company.

	The Company has three shareholder-approved equity compensation plans. The 1996 Long-Term Performance Plan
	(the &#147;1996 Plan&#148;), adopted in October 1996, provided for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to certain designated employees of the Company, non-employee directors of the Company and certain other
	persons performing significant services for the Company as designated by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. On May&nbsp;13, 2008, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the &#147;2008
	Plan&#148;), which was subsequently amended at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. The 2008 Plan, as amended, provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to certain designated employees of the
	Company, non-employee directors of the Company and certain other persons performing significant services for the Company as designated by the Compensation Committee. Upon approval of the 2008 Plan, the Company stopped making grants under the 1996
	Plan. On July 7, 2015, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2015 Plan. Upon approval of the 2015 Plan, the Company stopped making grants under the 2008 Plan.

	We have a policy against our directors, officers, employees, and consultants entering into transactions that present actual or potential
	conflicts of interests. A conflict of interest can arise when a director, officer, employee, or consultant takes an action or has an interest that may make it difficult for him or her to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts
	of interest may also arise when a director, officer, employee, or consultant (or his or her family members) receives improper personal benefits as a result of the director&#146;s, officer&#146;s, employee&#146;s, or consultant&#146;s relationship to
	us. This policy is reflected in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. In addition, the Audit Committee of the Board, pursuant to its charter, is responsible for reviewing and addressing conflicts of interest of directors and executive officers;
	as well as monitoring and reviewing (including discussing with management and the independent auditor) and, if appropriate, recommending to the full Board the approval or ratification of any transactions or courses of dealing with related parties

	The Audit Committee has adopted a formal policy on auditor independence requiring the advance approval by the Audit Committee of all audit
	and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. In determining whether to approve any services by our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee reviews the services and the estimated
	fees, and considers whether approval of the proposed services will have a detrimental impact on the auditor&#146;s independence. On an annual basis, our management reports to the Audit Committee all audit and non-audit services performed during the
	previous 12 months and all fees billed by our independent registered public accounting firm for such services.

	We have audited the

	shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
	(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
	reasonable basis for our opinion.

	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the

	On October&nbsp;18, 2016, during the course of responding to a comment letter from the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
	the Company determined that the Company&#146;s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 through December&nbsp;31, 2015, including the unaudited consolidated financial information for each quarterly
	period within the fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, as reported in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March&nbsp;10, 2016 and amended on April&nbsp;22, 2016, and its unaudited condensed consolidated financial
	statements for the quarters ended March&nbsp;31, 2016 and June&nbsp;30, 2016, and the related quarters in 2015, as reported in the Company&#146;s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed on May&nbsp;4, 2016 and August&nbsp;4, 2016, respectively, should
	no longer be relied upon due to an error identified therein, and that a restatement of these financial statements is required.

	The
	revenue related errors relate to the determination that a portion of the invoice price of product sold under the Company&#146;s supply agreement with Ares Trading S.A. (an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (&#147;Merck KGaA&#148;)) is
	considered contingent, and therefore not fixed or determinable at the time of shipment. The Company&#146;s previous practice was to record revenue at the time of shipment based on the invoice price, with an adjustment to increase or decrease revenue
	upon completion of the quarterly reconciliation process. Accordingly, correction of the revenue errors will result in a timing difference for the contingent portion of revenue from the Company&#146;s original methodology. The Company currently
	expects that, under the corrected methodology, revenue will be recognized in the period product is shipped to Merck KGaA for the fixed portion only (direct manufacturing cost plus 20%) with the contingent portion of the invoice price initially
	recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized upon completion of a quarterly reconciliation process that occurs after receiving sell-through information from Merck KGaA on a country-by-country basis.

	Additionally, the Company has a contract related to a COL-1077 clinical trial which has been in place since May 2015. During the course of
	compiling its results for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, the Company identified certain research and development expenses which had been incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, which had not been properly recorded in the
	periods to which the expenses related. The restatement reflects the recognition of additional research and development expense in the affected periods, with corresponding adjustments to prepaid expenses and other current assets, and accrued expenses
	related to those amounts. The additional research and development expenses incurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 were incurred during the three month period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The balances of prepaid expenses and other
	current assets and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 have been restated to reflect these corrections.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the restatement, the Company also recorded adjustments for certain other amounts which were previously concluded to be
	immaterial.&nbsp;Those adjustments include: 1) an adjustment to record additional income tax expense during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and a corresponding adjustment to reduce income tax expense in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014;
	2)&nbsp;an adjustment to increase cost of product revenues for the three month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 and a corresponding adjustment to reduce cost of product revenues for the same amount in the three month period ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 as reflected in our footnote containing unaudited quarterly information.&nbsp;Accordingly, the adjustment to cost of product revenues did not have an impact on the twelve months ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	On July&nbsp;26, 2013, Juniper&#146;s Board of Directors set a ratio of 1-for-8 for its previously approved reverse stock split which took
	effect on August&nbsp;9, 2013. The reverse stock split was approved by Juniper&#146;s shareholders at its annual meeting of shareholders on May&nbsp;1, 2013. All share and per share amounts relating to the common stock, stock options and common
	stock warrants included in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to this reverse stock split, including reclassifying an equal amount to the reduction in par
	value of common stock to additional paid-in capital. The reverse stock split did not result in a retroactive adjustment to the share amounts for any of the classes of the Company&#146;s preferred stock.

	receives from Allergan for CRINONE sales in the United States as well as the development of new product candidates. The service segment includes pharmaceutical development, clinical trial manufacturing, and advanced analytical and consulting
	services for the Company&#146;s customers as well as characterizing and developing pharmaceutical product candidates for the Company&#146;s internal programs and managing the preclinical and clinical manufacturing of COL-1077 and the Company&#146;s
	IVR. In September 2013, the Company acquired Juniper Pharma Services, a U.K.-based provider of pharmaceutical development, clinical trial manufacturing, and advanced analytical and consulting services to the pharmaceutical industry. The Company has
	integrated its supply chain management for its sole commercialized product, CRINONE into those operations and have therefore sought to capture synergies by transferring all operational activities related to its historic business.

	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used for, but are not
	limited to revenue recognition, sales return reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserve, impairment analysis of goodwill and intangibles including their useful lives, research and development accruals, deferred tax assets,
	liabilities and valuation allowances, common stock warrant valuations, and fair value of stock options. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	U.S. GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair
	value measurements. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
	between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes the following fair value hierarchy based
	on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value:

	Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
	liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

	The estimated fair value of the common stock warrant liability resulting from the October&nbsp;2009 registered direct offering
	of 1,362,500 shares of the common stock and warrants to purchase 681,275 shares of common stock was $0.4 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2013. There was no value associated with the common stock warrant liability as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. There
	was no value associated with the common stock warrant liability as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 as the Company neared the expiration of these warrants in April 2015. These values were determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which is
	based on the Company&#146;s stock price at measurement date, exercise price of this common stock warrant, risk-free rate and historical volatility, and are classified as a Level 2 measurement. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013,
	the Company recorded income of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, to adjust the value of the common stock warrant liability to market. The fair value of the common stock warrant liability as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 was zero, as the

	Juniper provides inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to
	physical deterioration, usage, obsolescence, reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices. Juniper balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and
	customer demand levels. Unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact Juniper&#146;s gross margins. Conversely, favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross

	(ii)&nbsp;Juniper&#146;s direct manufacturing cost plus 20% and are invoiced to Merck KGaA upon shipment. Juniper records revenue at the minimum selling price, which is Juniper&#146;s direct manufacturing cost plus 20%, at the time of shipment to
	Merck KGaA as that amount is considered fixed or determinable. The Company records deferred revenue related to amounts invoiced above the minimum selling price. Upon receiving sell through information from Merck KGaA on a quarterly and

	fixed-price contracts because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made, based on historical experience and the terms set forth in the contract, and are indicative of the level

	on a quarterly basis using an estimated rate and adjusted the provision when necessary. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, there is no sales returns reserve as the return rights obligation has elapsed for all products for which Juniper provided a

	The Company records stock-based compensation expense for stock options granted to non-employees based on the fair value of
	the stock options, which is re-measured over the graded vesting term resulting in periodic adjustments to stock-based compensation expense. During 2015, 243,000 stock options were granted by the Company to non-employees. During the twelve months
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million related to these awards. The stock-based compensation expense recorded for non-employees is primarily reflected in the research and development line
	of the statement of operations. The 240,000 options reflected in the research and development line will be re-measured over a 1.25 year period from the date of grant versus the remaining 3,000 options will be re-measured over a 3.75 year period from
	the date of grant. There was no stock-based compensation expense recorded for consultants in years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No tax benefit has been recognized due to the net tax losses during the periods presented.

	Basic (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing the net (loss) income, less preferred dividends

	In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.&nbsp;2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model
	that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense
	recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for
	capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
	its pending adoption of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, Financial Instruments&nbsp;&#150; Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which provides new guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation,
	and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The standard becomes effective for Juniper beginning in the first quarter of 2018 and early adoption is permitted. Juniper is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the standard will have on
	its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15, Presentation of
	Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern. The provisions of ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15 require management to assess an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S.
	auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1)&nbsp;provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2)&nbsp;require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3)&nbsp;provide principles for considering the mitigating
	effect of management&#146;s plans, (4)&nbsp;require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#146;s plans, (5)&nbsp;require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt
	is not alleviated, and (6)&nbsp;require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this ASU are effective for the annual period ending after
	December&nbsp;15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company does not believe this ASU will have an impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-09, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#148; (&#147;ASU&nbsp;2014-09&#148;), which
	provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue
	recognition requirements in Topic 605, &#147;Revenue Recognition,&#148; and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, &#147;Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type
	Contracts.&#148; The standard&#146;s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange
	for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today&#146;s guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable
	consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January&nbsp;1, 2018 and, at that time the Company may adopt the new
	standard under the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted.&nbsp;The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact that the adoption of ASU&nbsp;2014-09 will have on the
	Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

	In September 2013, Juniper
	assumed debt of $3.9 million in connection with its acquisition of Juniper Pharma Services. Juniper Pharma Services entered into a Business Loan Agreement (&#147;Loan Agreement&#148;) covering three loan facilities with Lloyds TSB Bank
	(&#147;Lloyds&#148;), as administrative agent. Juniper Pharma Services had withdrawn $3.9 million and as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 owed $3.1 million. The three loan facilities are each repayable by monthly installments, one started repayment in
	February 2013 and the remaining two commenced in October 2013. All facilities are due for repayment over 15 years from the date of drawdown. Two of the facilities bear interest at the Bank of England&#146;s base rate plus 1.95% and 2.55%,
	respectively. The interest rate at December&nbsp;31, 2015 for these two facilities was 2.45% and 3.05%, respectively. The third facility is a fixed rate agreement bearing interest at 3.52%&nbsp;per annum. The weighted average interest rate for the
	three loan facilities for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2015 was 3.00%. The Loan Agreement is secured by the mortgaged property and an unlimited lien on the other assets of Juniper Pharma Services. The Loan Agreement contains financial covenants
	that limit the amount of indebtedness Juniper Pharma Services may incur, requires Juniper Pharma Services to maintain certain levels of net worth, and restricts Juniper Pharma Service&#146;s ability to materially alter the character of its business.
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 the Company is in compliance with all of the covenants under the Loan Agreement.

	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more
	likely than not that some portion or all deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
	become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Management believes it is more likely than not that the results of
	future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income in the U.S. and the U.K., in order to realize the full benefits of the deferred tax assets in the respective jurisdictions.

	In March&nbsp;2002, the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan (the &#147;Rights Plan&#148;) designed to protect company stockholders in
	the event of takeover activity that would deny them the full value of their investment. The Rights Plan was not adopted in response to any specific takeover threat. In adopting the Rights Plan, the Board declared a dividend distribution of one
	preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on March&nbsp;22, 2002. The rights will become exercisable only in the event, with certain
	exceptions, a person or group of affiliated or associated persons acquires a specified amount (the &#147;Specified Amount&#148;) (originally 15%) or more of the Company&#146;s voting stock, or a person or group of affiliated or associated persons
	commences a tender or exchange offer which, if successfully consummated, would result in such person or group owning the Specified Amount or more of the Company&#146;s voting stock. Each right, once exercisable, will entitle the holder (other than
	rights owned by an acquiring person or group) to buy one one-thousandth of a share of a series of the Company&#146;s Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $30 per one-thousandth of a share, subject to adjustments. In addition,

	its option, exchange part or all of the rights (other than rights held by an acquiring person or group) for shares of the Company&#146;s common stock having a fair market value on the date of such acquisition equal to the excess of (i)&nbsp;the fair

	In November 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an amendment and restatement (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) of the Rights Plan,
	dated as of March&nbsp;13, 2002 (the &#147;Original Rights Agreement&#148;), between the Company and American Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company, LLC, as successor rights agent (as amended, the &#147;Rights Plan&#148;). In general, the
	Amendment leaves the Original Rights Agreement unchanged in all material respects, other than changing the trigger for the Rights becoming exercisable from 15% to 4.99% of the outstanding Voting Rights (as defined in the Rights Plan), expanding the
	concept of &#147;beneficial ownership&#148; to include shares owned (including those owned indirectly and constructively) under Section&nbsp;382 of the Code and modifying the provisions relating to the exchange of Rights for common stock.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company adopted the Amendment to preserve the value of the Company&#146;s net operating loss carry forwards (the &#147;Tax
	Benefits&#148;), because its ability to fully use the Tax Benefits on an annual basis to offset future income may be substantially limited if the Company experiences an &#147;ownership change&#148; for purposes of Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal
	Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#147;Code&#148;). Generally, the Company would experience an &#147;ownership change&#148; under Section&nbsp;382 of the Code if a greater than 50 percentage point change in ownership of the Voting Stock (as defined in the
	Rights Plan and described below) by stockholders who beneficially own (or who are deemed to own) 5% or more of the Company&#146;s Voting Stock occurs over a rolling three year period.

	In September 2011, the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent, further amended the Rights Plan to extend
	the expiration date of the rights from March&nbsp;12, 2012 to July&nbsp;3, 2013. In March 2013, the Company further amended the Rights Plan to extend the expiration date from July&nbsp;3, 2013, to July&nbsp;3, 2016. Except for the extension of the
	expiration date, the Rights Plan otherwise remained unmodified. The extension was made to preserve the value of the Tax Benefits.

	In
	January 2015, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved an amendment that increases the threshold ownership trigger from 4.99% to 9.99%. Accordingly, the Rights Plan is presently designed to reduce the likelihood that the Company will
	experience an ownership change by discouraging any person (together with such person&#146;s affiliates and associates), without the approval of the Board, (i)&nbsp;from acquiring 9.99% or more of the outstanding Voting Stock and (ii)&nbsp;that
	currently beneficially owns 9.99% or more of the outstanding Voting Stock from acquiring more shares of Voting Stock, other than by exercise or conversion of currently existing warrants, convertible securities or other equity-linked securities.
	There is no guarantee that the Rights Plan will prevent the Company from experiencing an ownership change.

	Juniper is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel intra-vaginal therapeutics that address unmet medical needs in women&#146;s
	health. All of the Company&#146;s product sales are outside the United States. The patent for CRINONE has expired in all countries other than Argentina. This product accounts for approximately 60% of the Company&#146;s revenues and a higher
	percentage of gross profit.

	The major raw materials the Company uses in our products and product candidates are polycarbophil and progesterone. Medical grade, cross-linked
	polycarbophil, the polymer used in our BDS-based product and product candidate is currently available from only one supplier, Lubrizol. We believe that Lubrizol will supply as much of the material as we require because our product ranks among the
	highest value-added uses of the polymer. In the event that Lubrizol cannot or will not supply enough polycarbophil to satisfy our needs, however, we will be required to seek alternative sources of supply.

	Only one supplier of progesterone for CRINONE is approved by regulatory authorities outside the United States. Juniper has not experienced
	production delays due to shortages of progesterone. This supplier has notified the Company that it intends to materially increase the price for its progesterone and has requested that Juniper enters into a long-term supply agreement. It is unclear
	what impact, if any, an increase in the cost of progesterone will have on Juniper&#146;s financial results or Juniper&#146;s demand for CRINONE, or whether the Company would be able to obtain progesterone from an alternate supplier in a timely
	manner.
