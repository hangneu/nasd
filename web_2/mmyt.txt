	from operating activities, profit (loss) for the year and diluted earnings (loss) per share, respectively. Each item is more fully explained in &#147;Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects&#148;. The presentation of these non-IFRS
	measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.

	Our business and financial performance is affected by the health of the travel industry in India and worldwide, including changes in supply and
	pricing. Events specific to the travel industry that could negatively affect our business include continued fare increases, travel-related strikes or labor unrest, general civil unrest, fuel price volatility and bankruptcies or liquidations of our
	suppliers. For example, events in the Middle East over the past several years have resulted in an adverse impact on travel to that region. Such events also impact crude oil prices which may have an adverse impact on the travel industry globally,
	including our business. Similarly, political unrest in Bangkok, Thailand, has negatively impacted travel to those locations. Sudden disruptions in travel have also followed terrorist attacks similar to the events of September 11, 2001 in the United
	States, the November 2015 Paris attacks and the March 2016 Brussels attacks and adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters similar to Hurricane Katrina, the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, the September 2014 Kashmir (India) floods and
	pandemic situations. In addition, the drop in the average value of the Indian Rupee as compared to the US dollar in fiscal year 2014 adversely impacted the Indian travel industry as it made travel for Indian consumers outside of India more
	expensive.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, our business is sensitive to safety concerns, and thus our business has in the past declined and may in the
	future decline after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism, during periods of political instability or conflict or during other periods in which travelers become concerned about safety issues, including as a result of natural disasters such as
	tsunamis or earthquakes or when travel might involve health-related risks, such as the influenza A virus (H1N1), avian flu (H5N1 and H7N9), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, the Zika virus or other epidemics or pandemics. In addition, there may be
	work stoppages or labor unrest at airlines or airports. Acts of terrorism and adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters such as those mentioned above may also in the future have a negative impact on our tourism business. Hotels,
	airlines, airports and cruises have in recent years been the subject of terrorist attacks, including cruise ship piracy, in the Gulf of Aden, India, Spain, Egypt, Russia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, France and Belgium. Such events are outside our control and
	could result in a significant decrease in demand for our travel services. Any such decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any other issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and adversely affect our business
	and financial performance over the short and long term. The occurrence of such events could result in disruptions to our customers&#146; travel plans and we may incur additional costs and constrained liquidity if we provide relief to affected
	customers by not charging cancellation fees or by refunding the cost of airline tickets, hotel reservations and other travel services and products. If there is a prolonged substantial decrease in travel volumes, particularly air travel and hotels,
	for these or any other reasons, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

	Since the beginning of the global financial crisis in the third quarter of 2008, adverse
	developments in the international financial markets have created challenging economic conditions for businesses and governments around the world. These adverse developments have included increased market volatility, tightened&nbsp;liquidity in
	credit markets, diminished expectations for economic growth and a reduction in consumer and business spending. While the global economy has recovered to some extent since 2010, the recovery remains fragile and slow-paced as high-income countries
	continue to suffer from volatility and slow growth, and it could be adversely impacted by several factors, including the deterioration of general economic conditions or political unrest in Europe as fiscal austerity continues, negative media
	coverage about the economic crisis in Greece, unemployment rates remain elevated and the potential for conflict in eastern Europe, restrained monetary policy in the form of tapering and other debt and fiscal issues in the United States and a
	slowdown in economic growth in China as its leadership attempts to rebalance its economy from investment and exports to increased domestic consumption and restrain lending practices. The weakness and uncertainty in the global economy have negatively
	impacted both corporate and consumer spending patterns and demand for travel services, globally and in India, and may continue to do so in the future.

	As an intermediary in the travel industry, a significant portion of our revenue is affected by fares and tariffs charged by our suppliers as
	well as volumes of sales made by us. During periods of poor economic conditions, airlines and hotels tend to reduce rates or offer discounted sales to stimulate demand, thereby reducing our commission-based income. A slowdown in economic conditions
	may also result in a decrease in transaction volumes and adversely affect our revenue. It is difficult to predict the effects of the uncertainty in global economic conditions. If economic conditions worsen globally or in India, our growth plans,
	business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

	Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain
	our relationships and arrangements with existing suppliers, such as airlines which supply air tickets to us directly, Amadeus IT Group, SA, or Amadeus, our global distribution system, or GDS, service provider, Indian Railways, hotels, hotel
	suppliers and destination management companies, bus operators and car hire companies, as well as our ability to establish and maintain relationships with new travel suppliers. A substantial portion of our revenue less service cost is derived from
	fees and commissions negotiated with travel suppliers for bookings made through our websites or via our other distribution channels. Adverse changes in existing arrangements, including an inability by any travel supplier to fulfill their payment
	obligation to us in a timely manner, increasing industry consolidation or our inability to enter into or renew arrangements with these parties on favorable terms, if at all, could reduce the amount, quality, pricing and breadth of the travel
	services and products that we are able to offer, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. For example, we have experienced short-term disruptions in the supply of tickets from domestic airlines in the past.

	In addition, adverse economic developments affecting the travel industry could also adversely impact our ability to maintain our existing
	relationships and arrangements with one or more of our suppliers. In particular, adverse changes to the overall business and financial climate for the airline industry in India due to various factors including, but not limited to, rising fuel costs,
	high taxes, significant depreciation of the Indian Rupee as compared to the US dollar making travel for Indian consumers outside India more expensive, and increased liquidity constraints, could affect the ability of one or more of our airline
	suppliers to continue to operate or otherwise meet our demand for tickets, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our financial results. For example, during fiscal year 2013, Kingfisher Airlines, one of the major airlines in India and
	one of our airline suppliers, shut down its operations, which resulted in a decline in the total capacity in the airline industry in India. In addition, adverse changes to the overall business and financial climate for the airline industry in India
	due to various factors including, but not limited to, rising fuel costs, high taxes, significant depreciation of the Indian Rupee as compared to the US dollar making travel for Indian consumers outside India more expensive, and increased liquidity
	constraints, resulted in airlines in India reducing the base commissions paid to travel

	reduce the base commissions paid to travel agencies and we spent significantly on marketing and sales expenses to promote transactions on our mobile platforms in India and to promote our international hotels. These factors were mainly responsible
	for our&nbsp;net loss of $(18.4) million in fiscal year 2015. Any consolidation in the airline industry involving our suppliers may also adversely affect our existing relationships and arrangements with such suppliers. During fiscal year 2016, we
	made significant investments in our ongoing customer inducement and acquisition programs, such as cash incentives and select loyalty program incentive promotions, to accelerate growth in our standalone hotel booking business in response to increased
	competition in the domestic travel market in India. This was the primary factor that resulted in our net loss of $(88.5) million in fiscal year 2016.

	periodic renewal and providing our counterparties with a right to terminate at short notice or without notice. Some of these agreements are scheduled to expire in the near future and we are in the process of renewing those agreements. Many of our
	suppliers with whom we have formal agreements, including airlines, are also able to alter the terms of their contracts with us at will or at short notice. For example, our agreement with Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited, or
	IRCTC, which allows us to transact with Indian Railways&#146; passenger reservation system through the Internet, can be terminated or temporarily suspended by IRCTC without prior notice and at its sole discretion. Termination, non-renewal or

	We have recently experienced significant growth in our hotels and packages business. Revenue less service cost from our hotels and packages
	business accounted for 37.6%, 45.1% and 51.1% of our total revenue less service cost in fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, which was primarily attributable to growth in our standalone hotel booking business. The Indian hotels industry
	is intensely competitive. We face increased competition in our hotels and packages segment primarily from established Indian travel market players, such as Cox &amp; Kings and Thomas Cook, and new entrants such as goibibo.com and OYO Rooms. In order
	to drive our growth strategy in the hotels business, we have incurred increased marketing and sales promotion expenses. For example, during fiscal year 2016, our marketing and sales promotion expenses increased to $109.0 million from $42.7 million
	in fiscal 2015 as we made significant investments in our ongoing customer acquisition programs, such as cash incentives and select loyalty program incentive promotions, to accelerate growth in our standalone hotel booking business in response to
	increased competition in the domestic travel market in India. We may continue to incur such expenses in future. Our marketing and sales promotion expenses associated with customer inducement and acquisition programs include cash incentives and
	select loyalty program incentive promotions, which we offer from time to time on various booking platforms. We may also increase our marketing and sales promotion expenses as a result of our expansion into new markets and such expenses may not be
	offset by increased revenue particularly at the initial commencement of business in these new markets. We may also be required to lower our fees and commissions charged to hotel suppliers to retain and increase our market share in response to
	competitors that are able to negotiate better rates and higher performance linked and other incentives from such suppliers, including new entrants with greater financial resources than us. Such expenses and any loss of revenue from competitive

	the Indian Rupee. We receive a substantial portion of our revenue in Indian Rupees and most of our costs are incurred in Indian Rupees. Any fluctuation in the value of the Indian Rupee against the US&nbsp;dollar, such as the approximately 7.0% drop
	in the average value of the Indian Rupee as compared to the US&nbsp;dollar in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the average value of the Indian Rupee against the US dollar in fiscal year 2015, will affect our results of operations. We expect to be
	adversely affected by any further depreciation of the Indian Rupee and Euro against the US dollar. The drop in the average value of the Indian Rupee as compared to the US dollar in fiscal year 2016 adversely impacted the Indian travel industry as it
	made outbound travel for Indian consumers more expensive. In addition, our exposure to foreign currency risk also arises in respect of our non-Indian Rupee-denominated trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and cash and cash
	equivalents. Similarly, the drop in the average value of the Euro as compared to the US dollar in fiscal year 2016 has also adversely impacted the European travel industry.

	implementing this strategy as it is subject to many factors which are beyond our control, including our ability to identify, attract and successfully execute suitable acquisition opportunities and partnerships. This strategy may also subject us to

	We generally do not assume inventory risk in our air ticketing business as we typically act as an agent. However, on a few occasions, we
	pre-purchase air ticket inventory in order to enjoy special negotiated rates and we assume inventory risk on such tickets. When we sell pre-purchased tickets to our customers, revenue is accounted for on a &#147;gross&#148; basis (representing the
	price of the tickets paid by our customers) and the amount spent to pre-purchase the ticket is classified as a service cost. We obtain inventory for most hotels outside India through contracts with online travel agents and aggregators outside India.
	In some instances, in order to enjoy special negotiated rates for these hotels, we pre-purchase hotel room nights and assume inventory risk on them.&nbsp;If we are unable to sell pre-purchased tickets or hotel room nights inventory as anticipated

	A company is said to be a resident in India if it is incorporated in India or if the control and management of its affairs is
	situated wholly in India. Individuals and companies that do not fulfil the above criteria are treated as non-residents for purposes of the Income-tax Act. The Finance Act, 2015 has amended this definition and brought in the concept of Place of

	events in India in the future could adversely affect the Indian economy by disrupting communications and making travel more difficult. Resulting political tensions could create a greater perception that investments in Indian companies involve a high
	degree of risk and could have an adverse impact on our business and the price of our ordinary shares. Furthermore, if India were to become engaged in armed hostilities, we might not be able to continue our operations. While we maintain insurance for
	losses arising from terrorist activities, our insurance policies do not cover business interruptions from terrorist attacks or for other reasons.

	India has experienced natural calamities such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and drought in the past few years. For example, in September
	2014, the state of Jammu and Kashmir in northern India, a popular tourism destination, experienced widespread floods and landslides, and in April 2015, an earthquake occurred in the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal with aftershocks and
	landslides subsequently affecting the country. The extent and severity of these natural disasters determines their impact on the Indian economy. Substantially all of our operations and employees are located in India and there can be no assurance
	that we will not be affected by natural disasters in the future. Furthermore, if any of these natural disasters occur in tourist destinations in India, travel to and within India could be adversely affected, which could have an adverse impact on our
	business and financial performance.

	Based on, among other things, the current
	and anticipated valuation of our assets and composition of our income and assets, we do not believe we were a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for US&nbsp;federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year or will become a PFIC in
	the foreseeable future. However, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to uncertainty in several respects. In addition, a separate determination must be made after the close of each taxable year as to whether we were a PFIC for that year.
	Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC for our current taxable year or any future taxable year. A non-US&nbsp;corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year if either (1)&nbsp;at least 75.0% of its gross income for such year
	is passive income or (2)&nbsp;at least 50.0% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive
	income. For this purpose, we will be treated as owning our proportionate share of the assets and earning our proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, at least 25.0% (by value) of the stock.
	Because the value of our assets for purposes of the PFIC test will generally be determined in part by reference to the market price of our ordinary shares, fluctuations in the market price of the ordinary shares may cause us to become a PFIC. In
	addition, changes in the composition of our income or assets may cause us to become a PFIC. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a US Holder (as defined in &#147;Item 10. Additional Information &#151; E. Taxation &#151; US Federal
	Income Taxation&#148;) holds an ordinary share, certain adverse US federal income tax consequences could apply to such US Holder. See &#147;Item 10. Additional Information &#151; E. Taxation &#151; US Federal Income Taxation &#151; Passive Foreign

	Our hotels and packages business generally yields higher net revenue margins than our air

	focus. Our objective is to enable more hotel suppliers to be seamlessly connected to our various websites with the latest technology methods which include direct connects, channel managers and direct integrations with various aggregators. We also
	continue to focus on automation by making changes to our extranet to allow more of our hotel suppliers to use a self-service mode in managing their rates, inventory, content, payments and confirm bookings made by our customers on a real-time basis.
	Given the high penetration of smart phones in India, we have also introduced our extranet application which allows hotels to directly update inventory, rates and confirm bookings through the application. We are investing heavily on improving the
	customer experience by improving our offering on various devices (especially mobile and tablets) which the customers use to connect with us and becoming more content focused. We also intend to grow our packages business outside India through

	product offerings is an important means of customer acquisition as the diversity of our services and products will improve our offerings to customers, attract more customers to our websites and allow us to cross sell higher-margin services and
	products to them. We actively market additional travel services to our customers. For example, we market non-air services directly to customers after they have booked their air tickets with us.

	feedback features to more products, enable more user-friendly bookings to be saved by our customers and used across all our services and products, enhance our mobile service platform to make mobile transactions more user-friendly and allow real-time
	fingerprinting to prevent online credit card fraud. We intend to sell more of our holiday packages online in addition to selling through our call centers, which we believe will result in increasing our operating margins. We believe that our

	Substantially all of our hotel suppliers in India have a &#147;direct allocation&#148; arrangement with us whereby they allocate rooms directly to us either by managing their room inventory on an extranet provided by us, or through channel managers,
	or supported by us via telephone. We do not assume any inventory risk for such &#147;direct allocation&#148; as unsold inventory is released to the hotels within an agreed period of time. The remaining hotels in India are connected through direct
	connects. &#147;Direct connect&#148; is the method by which our booking systems are integrated with the central reservations systems of the hotels and reservations made are confirmed on a real-time basis, although this applies to a small proportion
	of our total hotels. Through our ongoing efforts to increase the automation of and otherwise improve our extranet, our hotel suppliers are now able to perform more of the necessary functions for executing transactions through our system without our
	direct involvement. We obtain inventory for most hotels outside India through contracts with other online travel agents and aggregators outside India. In some instances, in order to enjoy special negotiated rates for these hotels, we pre-purchase
	hotel room nights and assume inventory risk on them. We also own the travel website www.easytobook.com, which was acquired in February 2014 as part of our acquisition of the ETB Group. The room inventory on HotelTravel.com is sold to MakeMyTrip.com
	and ETB Group customers. The provision of rooms at HotelTravel.com is predominantly accomplished through contracts with online travel agents and aggregators, but it also includes &#147;direct connects.&#148; MakeMyTrip.com&#146;s inventory of hotel

	servicing the Indian domestic and outbound market, the United States-India inbound market (focusing in particular on non-resident Indians in the United States), the United Arab Emirates as well as neighboring Middle East countries, Singapore and
	neighboring Southeast Asian countries and the Canada-India market, respectively. We have tailored www.makemytrip.com and its content to our predominantly Indian user base. For example, we have localized our top-selling hotel webpages with
	information and using language that we believe would be more attractive and relevant to an Indian user. We also own the travel website www.easytobook.com, which was acquired in February 2014 as part of our acquisition of the ETB Group. The room
	inventory on HotelTravel.com is sold to MakeMyTrip.com and the ETB Group&#146;s customers. The provision of rooms at HotelTravel.com is predominantly accomplished through contracts with online travel agents and aggregators, but it also includes
	&#147;direct connects.&#148; MakeMyTrip.com&#146;s inventory of hotel rooms is also sold through HotelTravel.com. In addition to the complete integration of the hotel room inventory available on HotelTravel.com, Eastytobook.com and MakeMyTrip.com,
	we are also working to integrate the technological capabilities of all three websites. For example, we have moved the hosting and monitoring of HotelTravel.com&#146;s technology infrastructure to our Indian external data centers and team. In
	addition, our internal team that monitors the technology infrastructure of MakeMyTrip.com has taken on similar responsibilities with respect to HotelTravel.com. These and other planned integrations notwithstanding, certain business and sales

	Using our websites, customers can easily and quickly review the pricing and availability
	of nearly all our services and products, evaluate and compare options, and book and purchase such service and products online. We have also designed our websites to offer personalized recommendations and offers based on a customer&#146;s history. In
	addition, we have self-service customer support modules on our websites to let our customers check their refund status, modify or cancel reservations and view their travel itineraries. Customers can also purchase ancillary travel-related services
	and products, such as travel insurance as part of the booking process. Certain packages for MICE or other customized packages cannot be purchased online although customers can submit inquiries through our websites and our sales representatives will
	contact such customers to follow up and process the transaction, if required.

	A customer conducts a search for a particular product, or combination of products (for example, flight plus hotel),
	on our websites by defining desired parameters. For example, for domestic Indian flights, apart from the city of departure and destination, number of travelers and dates of travel, our customers can also input additional parameters such as preferred
	cabin class, preferred airlines, refundable fares and direct flights. Our websites&#146; search capabilities employ scalable search and routing logic that we believe return comprehensive results without sacrificing search response times or creating
	added stress on our suppliers&#146; infrastructure. Our search results are generated in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner, since over 80% of our search results come from cache. Our web-based booking engine, which has been designed to link
	to our suppliers&#146; systems either through &#147;direct connects&#148; or a GDS (we primarily use Amadeus GDS), allows us to deliver real-time information. In addition, we also provide extranet access to our hotel suppliers where they can update

	After a customer has selected a particular option, our websites will provide the customer with

	of the product selected, and in the event the customer&#146;s choice is not available, the customer will be informed of the next-best alternative to the selected product. Customers booking air tickets or hotels will also be shown options to purchase

	In order to simplify the booking process for our customers, our websites do not require prior customer registration in order for the purchase
	to be completed. Customers who do not wish to register will simply be prompted prior to payment to provide basic contact details (including their name, telephone number and e-mail address) for purposes of the travel product they intend to purchase.
	An electronic confirmation is sent to the customer&#146;s e-mail address and customers can also use our self-service web-support, My Account, to check their booking details, print e-tickets and vouchers, cancel bookings and track progress of

	In our hotels and packages business, our revenue represents the total amount paid by our customers for these travel services and products and
	the cost of procuring the relevant services and products are classified as service cost. We also earn commissions from other hotel suppliers, typically larger hotel chain operators, depending on the volume of reservations made through us.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Through our websites, customers can search, compare and make reservations at more than 30,000 hotels and guesthouses in India and more than
	300,000 hotels and properties outside India as of March&nbsp;31, 2016. We procure room inventory from our hotel suppliers through three methods: &#147;direct connects,&#148; &#147;direct allocation&#148; and, for most hotels outside India, through
	contracts with online travel agents and aggregators outside India. Substantially all of our hotel suppliers in India have a &#147;direct allocation&#148; arrangement with us whereby they allocate rooms directly to us either by managing their room
	inventory on an extranet provided by us, or through channel managers, or supported by us via telephone. We do not assume any inventory risk for such &#147;direct allocation&#148; as unsold inventory is released to the hotels within an agreed period
	of time. The remaining hotels in India are connected through direct connects. &#147;Direct connect&#148; is the method by which our booking systems are integrated with the central reservations systems of the hotels and reservations made are
	confirmed on a real-time basis, although this applies to a small proportion of our total hotels. Through our ongoing efforts to increase the automation of and otherwise improve our extranet, our hotel suppliers are now able to perform more of the
	necessary functions for executing transactions through our system without our direct involvement. We obtain inventory for most hotels outside India through contracts with other online travel agents and aggregators outside India. In some instances,
	in order to enjoy special negotiated rates for these hotels, we pre-purchase hotel room nights and assume inventory risk on them. We also own the travel website www.easytobook.com, which was acquired in February 2014 as part of our acquisition of
	the ETB Group. In addition, we also own the travel website HotelTravel.com.

	Competition
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The market for travel services and products is highly competitive. We currently compete with both established and emerging providers of travel
	services and products, including other online travel agencies, such as cleartrip.com, expedia.com, travelocity.co.in, yatra.com, goibibo.com, booking.com and agoda.com, as well as traditional travel agencies, tour operators, travel suppliers and
	operators of travel industry reservation databases. Large, established Internet search engines have also launched applications offering travel itineraries in destinations around the world, and meta-search companies who can aggregate travel search
	results also compete with us for customers. In our domestic hotels and packages business, we compete primarily with established Indian travel market players, such as Cox&nbsp;&amp; Kings and Thomas Cook and new entrants such as goibibo.com and
	oyorooms.com. Such competitors may have greater financial resources than us, may seek to increase market share by offering heavy discounting and promotional schemes and may be able to negotiate better rates with suppliers.

	Certain of our travel suppliers have also been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on
	their own websites and decreasing or eliminating their dependence on third-party distributors like us. For instance, many low-cost airlines may, subject to applicable regulations, reduce or eliminate commissions to agents such as us or restrict the
	amount of service fees we are able to charge customers. Suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as their own bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make
	their offerings more attractive to customers than offerings like ours. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information &#151; D. &#151; Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Us and Our Industry &#151; The Travel Industry in India and Worldwide is Intensely

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are the
	leading online travel company in India. Through our primary website, www.makemytrip.com, and other technology-enhanced platforms, travelers can research, plan and book a wide range of travel services and products in India as well as overseas. Our
	services and products include air ticketing, hotels and packages, rail tickets, bus tickets, car hire and ancillary travel requirements such as facilitating access to travel insurance. In order to meet the requirements of the growing Indian middle
	class travel market where Internet penetration is relatively low, we also utilize other technology-enhanced distribution channels, including call centers, our travel stores in India, as well as our travel agents&#146; network in India. Our customers
	are now able to make bookings on our mobile site, http://m.makemytrip.com, and on major mobile platforms through our mobile applications, including Indian and international flights, hotels and holiday packages and Indian bus offerings through our
	iOS and Android applications, Indian domestic flights through our BlackBerry application, and Indian domestic flights and hotels through our Windows Mobile application. We believe that smartphones and mobile devices will become a more integral part
	of how our customers shop for and purchase our products in the coming years.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We generate revenue through two main lines of business, air
	ticketing, and hotels and packages. Our sales of air tickets and hotel rooms are primarily made through our website and our mobile applications. Our customers can book standard flight plus hotel packages on our websites, but the majority of the
	sales of packages within or outside India are concluded through our call centers, travel stores and travel agents&#146; network. We also generate revenue through the online sale of rail and bus tickets and by facilitating access to travel insurance,
	as well as advertising revenue from third-party advertisements on our websites.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our air ticketing business, our three main sources of
	revenue are (1)&nbsp;commissions and incentive payments from airline suppliers for tickets booked by customers through our distribution channels, (2)&nbsp;service fees we charge our customers and (3)&nbsp;fees from our GDS service provider. Revenue
	from our air ticketing business generally represents the commissions, incentive payments and fees we earn as an agent on a &#147;net&#148; basis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our hotels and packages business, revenue (including revenue on air tickets sold as part of packages) is generally accounted for on a
	&#147;gross&#148; basis, representing the total amount paid by our customers for these travel services and products. The cost of procuring the relevant services and products for sale to our customers in this business is classified as service cost.
	Our hotels and packages revenue also includes commissions we earn for the sale of hotel rooms (without packages), and commissions we earn as an agent from other online travel agents and aggregators from whom we procure hotel rooms for our customers
	for most hotels outside India, which are accounted for on a &#147;net&#148; basis. We earn commissions in a similar manner for certain non-hotel products related to our packages.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As certain parts of our revenue are recognized on a &#147;net&#148; basis and other parts of our revenue are recognized on a &#147;gross&#148;
	basis, we evaluate our financial performance based on revenue less service cost, which is a non-IFRS measure, as we believe that revenue less service cost reflects more accurately the value addition of the travel services that we provide to our
	customers. The presentation of this non-IFRS information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Our revenue less service cost may
	not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation.

	Our operating results are affected by certain key metrics that represent overall transaction activity and subsequent financial performance
	generated by our travel services and products. Three of the most important metrics, which are critical in determining the ongoing growth of our business, are revenue less service cost, gross bookings and net revenue margins.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Revenue from our air ticketing business is generally accounted for on a &#147;net&#148; basis (representing the commissions, incentive
	payments and fees we earn) and recognized at the time of issuance of air tickets. We account for our air ticketing revenue in this manner as we typically act as an agent and do not assume any performance obligation after the confirmation of the
	issuance of tickets. However, on a few occasions, we pre-purchase air ticket inventory in order to enjoy special negotiated rates and revenue from the sale of such tickets is accounted for on a &#147;gross&#148; basis (representing the price of the
	tickets paid by our customers) as we assume inventory risk on such pre-purchased tickets. The cost of such air tickets is classified as service cost.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Revenue from our hotels and packages business (including air tickets sold as part of packages) is generally accounted for on a
	&#147;gross&#148; basis, representing the total amount paid by our customers for these travel services and products, as we are the primary obligor and have responsibility for the delivery of services. The cost of procuring the relevant services and
	products for sale to our customers in this business is classified as service cost. However, our hotels and packages revenue also includes commissions we earn for the sale of hotel rooms (without packages), and commissions we earn as an agent from
	other online travel agents and aggregators from whom we procure hotel rooms for our customers for most hotels outside India, which are accounted for on a &#147;net&#148; basis. We earn commissions in a similar manner for certain non-hotel products
	related to our packages. Our hotels and packages revenue is recognized on the check-in date for hotel reservations and the date of departure for packages.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As certain parts of our revenue are recognized on a &#147;net&#148; basis and other parts of our revenue are recognized on a &#147;gross&#148;
	basis, we evaluate our financial performance based on revenue less service cost, as we believe this reflects more accurately the value addition of the travel services that we provide to our customers.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Net revenue margins is defined as revenue less service cost as a
	percentage of gross bookings and represent the commissions, fees, incentive payments and other amounts earned in our business. We follow net revenue margin trends closely across our various lines of business to gain insight into the profitability of
	our various businesses.

<I>
	Changes in Our Business Mix and Net Revenue Margins.
</I>
	Changes in the Indian air travel industry have affected, and will continue to
	affect, the revenue per transaction for travel agents, including our company. In particular, volatility in global economic conditions and jet fuel prices in recent years, as well as increased liquidity constraints, have caused our airline partners
	to pursue cost reductions in their operations, including reducing distribution costs. Measures taken by airlines to reduce such costs have included reductions in travel agent commissions. Many international airlines which fly to India have also
	either significantly reduced or eliminated commissions to travel agents. Unlike full-service airlines, low-cost airlines do not generally utilize GDSs for their ticket inventory. As a result, travel agents selling air tickets for low-cost airlines
	generally do not earn fees from GDSs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During fiscal year 2013, Kingfisher Airlines, one of the major airlines in India and one of our
	airline suppliers, shut down its operations, which resulted in a decline in the total capacity in the airline industry in India. In addition, adverse changes to the overall business and financial climate for the airline industry in India due to
	various factors including, but not limited to, rising fuel costs, high taxes, significant depreciation of the Indian Rupee as compared to the US dollar making travel for Indian consumers outside India more expensive, and increased liquidity
	constraints, resulted in airlines in India reducing the base commissions paid to travel agencies. These factors were primarily responsible for causing us to record a net loss of $20.9&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2014. During fiscal year 2015, the
	domestic airlines in India continued to reduce the base commissions paid to travel agencies and we spent significantly on marketing and sales promotion expenses to promote transactions on our mobile platforms in India and to promote our
	international hotels. These factors were mainly responsible for our net loss of $18.4&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2015. Any consolidation in the airline industry involving our suppliers may also adversely affect our existing relationships and
	arrangements with such suppliers. During fiscal year 2016, we made significant investments in our ongoing customer acquisition programs, such as cash incentives and select loyalty program incentive promotions, to accelerate growth in our standalone
	hotel booking business in response to increased competition in the domestic travel market in India. This was the primary factor that resulted in our&nbsp;net loss of $88.5&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2016.

	The hotels and packages business tends to yield higher margins than the air ticketing business, reflecting the greater value added in respect
	of the travel services that we provide in the hotels and packages segment as well as the diversity and more complex nature of hotels and packages services as compared with air tickets. We are focused on expanding our hotels and packages business
	and, accordingly, changing our revenue mix towards our hotels and packages segment.

	In fiscal year 2014, our air ticketing net revenue margin was 6.6%, which decreased to 6.1% in
	fiscal year 2015,&nbsp;mainly as a result of certain airlines in India lowering the base commissions paid to travel agencies in the fiscal year 2015. In fiscal year 2016, our air ticketing net revenue margins decreased marginally to 6.0%. Air
	ticketing transactions and gross bookings growth in 2016 was largely driven by the expansion of the travel market in India due to increased domestic travel, new entrants in the air travel market and the expansion of the Indian economy.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In fiscal year 2015, our net revenue margins in the hotels and packages business increased from 12.6% in fiscal year 2014 to 13.2% in fiscal
	year 2015. The increased margins during the reported year were driven by higher volumes, better negotiated rates and higher performance linked incentives based on target achievement and other incentives. The growth in this segment was further aided
	by full year impact of consolidation of ETB Group into our financial results, which we acquired in February 2014. In fiscal year 2016, our net revenue margins in the hotels and packages business increased from 13.2% in fiscal year 2015 to 15.3% in
	fiscal year 2016. The increase in net revenue margin in fiscal year 2016 was achieved due to better negotiated rates and higher performance linked and other incentives from our suppliers. Increased transaction growth in our hotels and packages
	business in fiscal year 2016 was driven by strong growth in our standalone hotel business.

	Our hotels and packages transactions have

	2014 to $565.8 million in fiscal year 2016. Revenue less service cost from our hotels and packages business accounted for 37.6%, 45.1% and 51.1% of our total revenue less service cost in fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The increase
	of revenue less service cost in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to an increase in gross bookings by 19.6%, a 126.4% increase in the number of transactions and an expansion of net revenue margins from 13.2% in fiscal year
	2015 to 15.3% in fiscal year 2016.

	Competition in the
	Indian online travel industry has intensified and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Increased competition may cause us to increase our marketing and sales promotion expenses in the future in order to
	compete effectively with new entrants and existing players in the market. We also incur marketing and sales promotion expenses associated with customer inducement and acquisition programs, including cash incentives and select loyalty program
	incentive promotions, which we offer from time to time on various booking platforms. We may also increase our marketing and sales promotion expenses as a result of our expansion into new markets and such expenses may not be offset by increased
	revenue particularly at the initial commencement of business in these new markets.

	The reporting currency of our financial statements is the US dollar. However, the functional currency of our key operating subsidiary in India is the Indian Rupee. We generate a substantial portion of our revenue in Indian Rupees and
	substantially all of our costs are borne in Indian Rupees. A majority of our assets and liabilities are also denominated in Indian Rupees.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The financial statements of all our subsidiaries are translated to our reporting currency using relevant exchange rates in accordance with
	IFRS. In particular, the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated to US dollars at exchange rates as of the relevant reporting date, and the income and expenses of our foreign operations are translated to US dollars at the
	average of the exchange rates applicable during the relevant reporting period. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the re-measurement of monetary items at year-end exchange rates are recognized in
	the profit or loss of the period in which they arise. For the purposes of consolidation, all income and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period covered by the applicable statement of income and assets and
	liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. When the US dollar strengthens against the Indian Rupee, our revenue and costs in Indian Rupees converted to US dollars decrease. When the US dollar weakens, our
	revenue and costs in Indian Rupees converted to US dollars increase.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the past few years, there have been periods of high volatility in
	the Indian Rupee and US dollar exchange rate. In fiscal year 2016, the average value of the Indian Rupee depreciated 7.0% against the US dollar as compared to the average value of the Indian Rupee in fiscal year 2015. This volatility is illustrated
	in the table set forth in the section titled &#147;Exchange Rates.&#148; As a result of the depreciation of the Indian Rupee and the Euro against the US dollar during fiscal year 2016, our loss on account of foreign exchange fluctuations during
	fiscal year 2016 was $(4.5) million as compared to $(5.2) million for fiscal year 2015.

	We commenced
	operations in 2000 and in the first five years following our inception, we focused on the non-resident Indian market in the United States, primarily servicing its demand for air tickets from the United States to India. In 2005, we started our Indian
	air ticketing business. Over time, we have expanded our hotels and packages business as well as expanded internationally and introduced new non-air services and products such as the sale of rail and bus tickets, and facilitating access to travel
	insurance. We also generate advertising revenue from third-party advertisements on our websites.

	We
	earn commissions from airlines for tickets booked by customers through our distribution channels as well as incentive payments linked to the number of sales facilitated by us. We either deduct commissions at the time of payment of the fare to our
	airline suppliers or collect our commissions on a regular basis from our airline suppliers, whereas incentive payments are collected from our airline suppliers on a periodic basis. Incentives earned from airlines are recognized on the basis of
	performance targets agreed with the relevant airline and when performance obligations have been completed. We charge our customers a service fee for booking airline tickets. We receive fees from our GDS service provider based on the volume of sales
	completed by us through the GDS. Revenue from air tickets sold as part of packages is eliminated from our air ticketing revenues and added to our hotels and packages revenue.

	Revenue from our hotels and packages business generally represents the total amount paid by our

	agent from other online travel agents and aggregators from whom we procure hotel rooms for our customers for most hotels outside India, which are accounted for on a &#147;net&#148; basis.

	service cost associated with our air ticketing business. However, on a few occasions, we pre-purchase air ticket inventory in order to enjoy special negotiated rates and revenue from the sale of such tickets is recognized on a &#147;gross&#148;
	basis (representing the retail value of the tickets paid by our customers). The cost of such air tickets is classified as service cost.

	of airline ticketing revenue, upon date of departure in the case of packages and upon check-in in the case of hotels. As the customer is primarily required to pay the amount at the time of transaction, collectability is reasonably assured.

	Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is
	transferred to us. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is
	demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, including those which significantly affect the entity&#146;s returns.

	The carrying amounts of our non-financial assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, technology-related development cost, software and
	other intangible assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset&#146;s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for
	impairment. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit, or CGU, exceeds its recoverable amount.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use,
	the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assumptions of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing,
	assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, CGUs to which
	goodwill has been allocated are aggregated to that level at which impairment testing is performed which reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is
	allocated to a group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Impairment losses are recognized in
	profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (or group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (or

	We apply the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted, which
	requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share option, share price volatility, and the pre-vesting option forfeiture rate. Expected life is based on historical exercise patterns, which we believe are
	representative of future behavior. We estimate expected volatility at the date of grant based on historical volatility of comparable companies for the period equal to the expected term of the options. Expected dividends percentage is taken as zero
	as we do not anticipate issuing dividends. The risk-free interest rate is the yield on a treasury bond with a remaining term equal to the expected option life assumed at the date of grant. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share
	options represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense could be
	materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate share-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for share-based awards, we periodically conduct an assessment
	of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the type of award, the employee class and
	historical experience. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the share-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.

	$184.5 million in fiscal year 2014. Our revenue less service costs increased by 56.6% to $62.6 million in fiscal year 2015 from $40.0 million in fiscal year 2014. This growth was due to an increase in gross bookings by 49.0%, a 59.3% increase in the
	number of transactions and an expansion of net revenue margins from 12.6% in fiscal year 2014 to 13.2% in fiscal year 2015. The increased margins during the reported year were driven by higher volumes, better negotiated rates with our suppliers and
	higher performance linked incentives based on target achievement and other incentives provided to us by our suppliers. The growth in this segment was further aided by full year impact of consolidation of the ETB Group into our financial results,
	which we acquired in February 2014.

	We are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates, primarily those related to the US dollar and

	and other payables and cash and cash equivalents, which were $9.2 million, $44.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, as of March&nbsp;31, 2016. Based on our operations in fiscal year 2016, a 10.0% appreciation of the US dollar against the Indian
	Rupee as of March&nbsp;31, 2016, assuming all other variables remained constant, would have increased our loss for fiscal year 2016 by $3.3&nbsp;million. Similarly, a 10.0% depreciation of the US dollar against the Indian Rupee as of March&nbsp;31,

	Further,
	we are also exposed to movements in currency exchange rates between the US dollar and the Euro. As the functional currency of the Hotel Travel Group is the US dollar, our exposure to foreign currency risk primarily arises in respect of our non-US
	dollar denominated trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and cash and cash equivalents, which were $0.8 million, $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, as of March&nbsp;31, 2016. Based on our operations in fiscal year 2016, a
	10.0% appreciation of the Euro against the US&nbsp;dollar as of March&nbsp;31, 2016, assuming all other variables remained constant, would have increased our loss for the year by $0.1 million. Similarly, a 10.0% depreciation of the Euro against the

	fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, was generated by MMT India from its air ticketing business and received in US dollars although our expenses are generally incurred in Indian Rupees. Additionally, we receive revenue from our hotels and
	packages business in Indian Rupees, but a portion of our expenses in this segment (those relating to outbound packages from India in particular) could be incurred in a non-Indian currency. We currently do not have any hedging agreements or similar
	arrangements with any counter-party to cover our exposure to any fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Fluctuation in the Indian Rupee-US dollar exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and

	2015, we had fixed rate financial instruments consisting of $93.5 million of term deposits. We have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to
	referring to revenue less service cost, we also refer to adjusted operating profit (loss), adjusted net profit (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share which are non-IFRS measures and most directly comparable to results from operating
	activities, profit (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the year, respectively, each of which is an IFRS measure.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As certain
	parts of our revenues are recognized on a &#147;net&#148; basis and other parts of our revenue are recognized on a &#147;gross&#148; basis, we evaluate our financial performance based on revenue less service costs, which is a non-IFRS measure, as we
	believe that revenue less service costs reflects more accurately the value addition of the travel services that we provide to our customers. The presentation of this non-IFRS information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute
	for our consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Our revenue less service costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to potential differences in the method

	We use financial statements that exclude share-based compensation expense, all merger and acquisitions related expenses,
	amortization of acquired intangibles and change in financial liability relating to acquisitions for our internal management reporting, budgeting and decision making purposes, including comparing our operating results to that of our competitors.
	Because of varying available valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions that companies can use when adopting IFRS 2 &#147;Share based payment&#148;, management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude such expenses
	allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted operating profit (loss) and adjusted net profit (loss) are useful in measuring the results of our
	company and provide investors and analysts a more accurate representation of our operating results. However, the presentation of these non-IFRS measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our consolidated financial
	results prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. These non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. The IFRS measures most
	directly comparable to adjusted operating profit (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) are results from operating activities and profit (loss) for the period, respectively.

	A limitation of using adjusted operating profit (loss) and adjusted net profit (loss) versus operating profit (loss) and net profit (loss)
	calculated in accordance with IFRS is that these non-GAAP financial measures exclude a recurring cost, namely share-based compensation. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information on the IFRS amounts excluded from
	adjusted operating profit (loss) and adjusted net profit (loss).

	IFRS 9 Financial Instruments:
</B>
	In July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board issued the final version of IFRS 9, Financial
	Instruments. The standard aims to reduce the complexity of the current rules on financial instruments as mandated in IAS 39. IFRS 9 has fewer classification and measurement categories as compared to IAS 39 and has eliminated the categories of held
	to maturity, available for sale and loans and receivables. Further it eliminates the rule-based requirement of segregating embedded derivatives and tainting rules pertaining to held to maturity investments. For an investment in an equity instrument
	which is not held for trading, IFRS 9 permits an irrevocable election, on initial recognition, on an individual share-by-share basis, to present all fair value changes from the investment in other comprehensive income. No amount recognized in other
	comprehensive income would ever be reclassified to profit or loss. It requires the entity, which chooses to measure a liability at fair value, to present the portion of the fair value change attributable to the entity&#146;s own credit risk in other
	comprehensive income.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with an expected credit loss model. The measurement uses a dual
	measurement approach, under which the loss allowance is measured as either 12 month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses. The standard also introduces new presentation and disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The effective date for adoption of IFRS 9 is annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, though early adoption is permitted. Our
	Group is currently evaluating the requirements of IFRS 9, and has not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements.

	IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
</B>
	&nbsp;In May 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board and Financial Accounting
	Standards Board jointly issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
	reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Further the new standard requires enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
	from the entity&#146;s contracts with customers.

	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
	The effective date for adoption of IFRS 15 is annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, though early adoption is permitted.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In September 2015, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 15, deferring the adoption of the standard to periods beginning on or after January 1,
	2018 instead of January 1, 2017.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April 2016, the IASB amended IFRS 15 to provide clarifications to apply the principles of IFRS 15 as

	IFRS 16 Leases:
</B>
	On January 13, 2016, the International Accounting Standards
	Board issued the final version of IFRS 16, Leases. IFRS 16 will replace the existing leases standard, IAS 17, Leases, and related interpretations. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
	leases for lessees and lessors. It introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. Currently,
	operating lease expenses are charged to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (loss). IFRS 16 also contains enhanced disclosure requirements for lessees. The effective date for adoption of IFRS 16 is annual periods beginning
	on or after January 1, 2019, though early adoption is permitted for companies applying IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our Group is yet to evaluate the requirements of IFRS 16 and the impact on our consolidated financial statements.

	objections in January 2012 for fiscal year 2011, and in February 2013, for fiscal year 2012, respectively. In August 2013, the Commissioner of Service Tax rejected our objections and confirmed the demand on all the above matters with negligible
	relief. In November 2013, we filed an appeal with the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. The aggregate value of the claims is approximately Rs. 1,700 million (approximately $25.3 million) and additional interest and penalties if
	finally determined to be payable. We have deposited approximately Rs.&nbsp;22&nbsp;million (approximately $0.3 million) toward service tax with the relevant authorities. We do not recognize these claims as a contingent liability as we believe the
	likelihood of the claims being upheld by the relevant authorities to be remote. The matter is currently pending.

	On June 2,
	2009, we received a notification of complaint filed by Tata Sons Limited, or Tata, from the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO, Arbitration and Mediation Center under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy. Tata alleged
	that our use of the word &#147;tata&#148; in the domain name for our Indian online travel community website, &#147;www.oktatabyebye.com,&#148; derived benefit from the goodwill of the &#147;Tata&#148; name. On August&nbsp;11, 2009, WIPO ordered that
	our domain name be transferred to Tata. The order can be contested in a court of appropriate jurisdiction and we have accordingly appealed against the order at the High Court of Delhi and the United States District Court in the Western District of
	Washington. In furtherance of our appeal in India, we and Tata have agreed to stay all proceedings in the United States until the Indian proceedings are resolved or terminated, and that in the event of resolution in the Indian proceedings, the
	parties will cooperate with one another and perform any acts reasonably necessary to comply with the Indian court&#146;s ruling. The Hon&#146;ble High Court of Delhi has disposed of the proceedings, including the appeal vide its order dated
	July&nbsp;29, 2015 as parties have entered into a settlement.

	deposits made by us under our agreements signed with the hotel in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 in order to assure available room inventory at pre-agreed rates. We deposited the checks when the agreements were not complied with by the hotel, including
	by not providing a bank guarantee. We have initiated criminal proceedings against the hotel and its owner for failing to honor the checks and also for breach of the terms of the agreement. Hotel Pine Spring has failed to appear before the Magistrate
	on various occasions and non-bailable warrants have been issued. The next date in the matter is November&nbsp;26, 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has
	two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must
	inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best
	interests of the corporation. He or she must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take
	precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the
	honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a
	director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a matter of Mauritius law, a director of a Mauritius company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it
	is considered that he owes duties to the company that include a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him to do so) and a duty not
	to put himself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party. Under the Mauritius Companies Act, our directors have a duty to our company to exercise their powers
	honestly, in good faith and in the best interests of our company. Our directors also have a duty to our company to exercise the degree of care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. Where a
	director of a public company also holds office as an executive, the director is required under Mauritius law to exercise that degree of care, diligence and skill which a reasonably prudent and competent executive in that position would exercise. In
	fulfilling their duty of care to our company, our directors must ensure compliance with the Mauritius Companies Act and our Constitution, as amended from time to time.

	The Delaware General Corporation Law contains business combination provision applicable to Delaware corporations whereby, unless the
	corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an &#147;interested shareholder&#148; for three years
	following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. Subject to specified exceptions, an interested shareholder is a person or a group that owns 15.0% or more of the corporation&#146;s outstanding voting stock (including any rights
	to acquire stock pursuant to an option, warrant, agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion or exchange rights, and stock with respect to which the person has voting rights only), or is an affiliate or associate of
	the corporation and was the owner of 15.0% of more of the corporation&#146;s outstanding voting stock at any time within the previous three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the
	target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business
	combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target&#146;s board of

	The Income Tax Act 1995 of Mauritius imposes a tax in Mauritius on the chargeable income of our company at the rate of 15.0%. However, under
	the Income Tax (Foreign Tax Credit) Regulations 1996 of Mauritius, subject to the Income Tax Act 1995 and the regulations of the Income Tax (Foreign Tax Credit) Regulations 1996, credit is allowed for foreign tax on the foreign source income of a
	resident of Mauritius against Mauritius tax computed by reference to the same income, and where credit is allowed against Mauritius tax chargeable in respect of any income, the amount of Mauritius tax so chargeable shall be reduced by the amount of
	the credit. Under the Income Act, 1995, &#147;foreign source income&#148; means income which is not derived from Mauritius and includes in the case of a corporation holding a Category 1 Global Business Licence under the Financial Services Act 2007
	of Mauritius, income derived from its transactions with non-residents or corporations holding a Category 1 Global Business Licence under the Financial Services Act. Subject to the provisions of the Income Tax (Foreign Tax Credit) Regulations 1996,
	no credit is allowed in respect of foreign tax unless written evidence is presented to the Mauritius Revenue Authority showing the amount of foreign tax which has been charged and for this purpose, &#147;written evidence&#148; includes a receipt of
	the relevant authorities of the foreign country for the foreign tax or any other evidence that the foreign tax has been deducted or paid to the relevant authorities of that country. However, pursuant to regulation 8 of the Income Tax (Foreign Tax
	Credit) Regulations 1996, if written evidence is not presented to the Mauritius Revenue Authority showing the amount of foreign tax charged on our foreign source income, the amount of foreign tax shall nevertheless be conclusively presumed to be
	equal to 80.0% of the Mauritius tax chargeable with respect to that income and in such circumstance, the effective tax rate in Mauritius on our chargeable income would be 3.0%.

	Following amendments to the Financial Services Act 2007 of Mauritius pursuant to the Finance
	(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 in December 2010, Mauritius companies holding a Category 1 Global Business Licence, or GBC1, issued by the Financial Services Commission in Mauritius are permitted to conduct business both in and outside Mauritius
	(instead of outside Mauritius only). The operations of a GBC1 company in Mauritius will be subject to tax on chargeable income at the rate of 15.0% in Mauritius. Mauritius currently has no capital gains tax and has no taxation in the nature of a
	withholding tax on the payment of dividends. There is no withholding tax requirement on interest or royalties payments applicable to us as a holder of a Category 1&nbsp;Global Business Licence issued by the Financial Services Commission in Mauritius
	where such interest are paid to a non-resident of Mauritius not carrying on any business in Mauritius and such royalties are paid to non-residents of Mauritius. There is no estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax in Mauritius.

	maturity except that this would result in a lower interest rate. Trade and other receivables are typically unsecured and arise mainly from commissions and incentive payments owing to us from our airline suppliers, receivables from our hotel
	suppliers which represent amounts owing to us from deposits we place with such hotels, and receivables from our corporate and retail customers to whom we typically extend credit periods. We review the credit worthiness of our clients to which we
	have granted credit terms in the normal course of the business. We believe there is no significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance of the counterparties to these financial instruments, other than the amounts already provided for in our
	financial statements. See note 34 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information relating to our exposure to credit risk.

	fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, was generated by MMT India from its air ticketing business and received in US dollars although our expenses are generally incurred in Indian Rupees. Additionally, we receive revenue from our hotels and

	arrangements with any counter-party to cover our exposure to any fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Fluctuation in the Indian Rupee-US dollar exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and
	results of operations as reported in US dollars. For more information, see &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Us and Our Industry &#151; Our Results of Operations are Subject to Fluctuations in Currency Exchange Rates&#148;.

	Interest Rate Risk.
</I>
<I>
	&nbsp;
</I>
	Our exposure to interest rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our term deposits
	and bank overdrafts. As of March&nbsp;31, 2016, we had fixed rate financial instruments consisting of $169.3 million of term deposits and $7.2 million of variable rate financial instruments, consisting of our bank overdrafts. As of March&nbsp;31,
	2015, we had fixed rate financial instruments consisting of $93.5 million of term deposits. We have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material
	risks due to changes in interest rates. Our future interest income and financing cost may fluctuate in line with changes in interest rates. As of March 31, 2016, we had $7.2 million outstanding on account of variable rate financial instruments. A
	sensitivity analysis shows that an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates as of March 31, 2016 would have increased loss by $0.1 million and would not have had any impact on our equity. Similarly, a decrease of 100 basis points in interest
	rates as of March 31, 2016 would have decreased loss by $0.1 million and would not have had any impact on our equity. As&nbsp;of March&nbsp;31, 2015, we had no amount outstanding on account of variable rate financial instruments. A&nbsp;sensitivity
	analysis shows that any increase in the interest rates as of March&nbsp;31, 2015 would not have affected our profit or loss and would not have had any impact on our equity.

	million at a price per ordinary share not to exceed $21.50 until November&nbsp;30, 2021. We repurchased 100, 20,000 and 768,357 ordinary shares at an average price of approximately $12.50 per share, $20.83 per share and $14.41 per share (excluding
	broker and transaction fees) in fiscal year 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. As of March&nbsp;31, 2016, we had remaining authority to repurchase up to approximately $138.01 million of our outstanding ordinary shares.

	An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference

	Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognized through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

	Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are recognized by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the fair value reserve in
	equity to profit or loss. The cumulative loss that is reclassified from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortization, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss
	recognized previously in profit or loss. Changes in cumulative impairment losses attributable to application of the effective interest method are reflected as a component of interest income. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired
	available-for-sale debt security increases and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized, then the impairment loss is reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognized in profit or
	loss. However, any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale equity security is recognized in other comprehensive income.

	In July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board issued the final version of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. The
	standard reduces the complexity of the current rules on financial instruments as mandated in IAS 39. IFRS 9 has fewer classification and measurement categories as compared to IAS 39 and has eliminated the categories of held to maturity, available
	for sale and loans and receivables. Further it eliminates the rule-based requirement of segregating embedded derivatives and tainting rules pertaining to held to maturity investments. For an investment in an equity instrument which is not held for
	trading, IFRS 9 permits an irrevocable election, on initial recognition, on an individual share-by-share basis, to present all fair value changes from the investment in other comprehensive income. No amount recognized in other comprehensive income
	would ever be reclassified to profit or loss. It requires the entity, which chooses to measure a liability at fair value, to present the portion of the fair value change attributable to the entity&#146;s own credit risk in other comprehensive
	income.

	The Standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract

	operating lease expenses are charged to the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (loss). The Standard also contains enhanced disclosure requirements for lessees. The effective date for adoption of IFRS 16 is annual periods
	beginning on or after January 1, 2019, though early adoption is permitted for companies applying IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Group is yet to evaluate the requirements of IFRS 16 and the impact on the consolidated financial

	Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that
	are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group&#146;s approach to manage liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed
	conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Group&#146;s reputation.

	The Group&#146;s exposure to credit risk is limited, as its customer base consists of a large number of customers and the majority of its
	collections from customers are made on an upfront basis at the time of consummation of the transaction. There is limited credit risk on sales made to corporate customers, incentives due from the airlines and its Global Distribution System (GDS)
	provider. The Group has not experienced any significant default in recovery from such customers.

	Additionally, the Group places its cash
	and cash equivalents and term deposits with banks with high investment grade ratings, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one bank and conducts ongoing evaluation of the credit worthiness of the banks with which it does business. Given the
	high credit ratings of these financial institutions, the Group does not expect these financial institutions to fail in meeting their obligations. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.

	A majority of the financing of the Group has come from a mix of ordinary or convertible and redeemable preference shares with nominal
	dividends, proceeds from public offerings, proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes and an overdraft facility with banks. The interest rates on the overdraft facility availed by the subsidiaries of the parent company are marginally higher
	than the interest rates on term deposits with the banks. Further, the interest rate on convertible notes is fixed. Accordingly, there is limited interest rate risk. The Group&#146;s investments in majority of term deposits with banks are for short
	duration, and therefore do not expose the group to significant interest rate risk.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In January 2016, the Company issued 4.25% convertible notes of USD 180,000 in two tranches to Ctrip.com International, Ltd., which are
	redeemable after 5 years at par value. The Company incurred USD 2,730 as transaction costs during the year ended March 31, 2016 on issuance of the convertible notes. The convertible notes can also be converted into ordinary shares of the Company at
	any time till the maturity of the convertible notes at the option of the holder at the conversion price of USD 21.45 per share. Interest on the convertible notes is payable on semi-annually basis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of issue, the holder has a right to redeem these convertible notes in whole or in part before the maturity on occurrence of
	certain events, including but not limited to a change in control, or liquidation of the company. Further, the convertible notes have few adjustment clauses which along with preserving the relative economic interests of the holder also protect the
	holder from decline in the market value of the Company&#146;s securities. The price protection clause may result in the entity issuing variable number of shares on conversion hence, represents a liability. The conversion option is presented together
	with the related liability as a derivative, and has been accounted for at fair value.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The liability component is initially recognized at
	fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. On initial recognition, the fair value of convertible notes is different from its transaction price, but this fair value measurement is not evidenced by a valuation technique that uses
	only data from observable markets, accordingly, the carrying amount of the convertible notes on initial recognition is adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value measurement and the transaction price. This deferred difference is
	subsequently recognized as a gain or loss over the period of maturity of the convertible notes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Subsequent to initial recognition, the
	liability component of the convertible notes is being measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The conversion option is being subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized in
	profit or loss.

	In 2000, the Group approved a share option
	programme in Mauritius, named the MakeMyTrip.com Equity Option Plan (&#147;MMT ESOP Plan&#148;). In June 2009, this plan was expanded in order to issue share options to employees of subsidiaries and directors of the group. The Group replaced certain
	share options to acquire shares in its Indian subsidiary held by employees at its subsidiaries with options granted under the MMT ESOP Plan. Total options granted under this plan were 2,703,810 during the year ended March 31, 2010. No options were
	granted during the year ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

	Any change in the exchange rate of USD against currencies other than INR and EUR is not expected to have significant impact on the Group&#146;s
	profit or loss. Accordingly, a 10% appreciation of the USD as indicated below, against the INR and EUR would have increased loss by the amounts shown below and a 10% appreciation of the EUR as indicated below, against the USD would have increased
	loss for the current year/decreased loss for the previous year by the amounts shown below. This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period. The
	analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

	Expected term is also a significant unobservable input in valuing the separable embedded derivative. The

	The Group recognizes revenue net of cancellations, refunds, discounts and taxes. The Group executed various customer inducement/acquisition programs during the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2016. In the quarter ended

	cost, are recorded as an element of marketing and sales promotion expenses instead of as a reduction / deferral of revenue, while regular discounts, which are not part of the above programs, are netted of revenue in accordance with applicable IFRSs
