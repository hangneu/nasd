	We are a water
	resource management company that owns, operates and manages water, wastewater and recycled water utilities in strategically located communities, principally in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. We seek to deploy our integrated approach, which we refer
	to as &#147;Total Water Management,&#148; a term we use to mean managing the entire water cycle by owning and operating the water, wastewater and recycled water utilities within the same geographic areas in order to both conserve water and maximize
	its total economic and social value. We use Total Water Management to promote sustainable communities in areas where we expect growth to outpace the existing potable water supply. Our model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity
	and applies principles of water conservation through water reclamation and reuse. Our basic premise is that the world&#146;s water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water and by
	providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We currently own nine water and wastewater
	utilities in strategically targeted communities principally in metropolitan Phoenix. We currently serve more than 50,000 people in approximately 20,000 homes within our 332 square miles of certificated service areas, which are serviced by five
	wholly-owned regulated operating subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Approximately 94.9% of our active service connections are customers of our Santa Cruz and Palo Verde utilities, which are located within a single service area. We have grown
	significantly since our formation in 2003, with total revenues increasing from $4.9 million in 2004 to $32.0&nbsp;million in 2015, and total service connections increasing from 8,113 as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 to 38,744 as of December&nbsp;31,
	2015, with regionally planned service areas large enough to serve approximately two million service connections.

	We have three regional planning areas located in the metropolitan Phoenix area with area-wide permits and contractual service rights relating
	to over 500 square miles of territory. Our Maricopa-Casa Grande regional planning area and Eloy regional planning area are located in Pinal County, Arizona. Pinal County is rapidly changing from primarily rural to an area of suburbanization.
	According to a U.S. Census estimate, Pinal County grew by 124% from a population of 179,727 in 2000 to 401,918 in 2014, and by 7% between years 2010 and 2014, ranking it as a third fastest growing county in Arizona based on percentage population

	the Maricopa-Casa Grande region, where our local utilities have considerable infrastructure already in place. As a result of our investment in modern infrastructure, we expect our regulated utilities business in our current service areas to have
	relatively low capital expenditures for the foreseeable future because greater than 90% of our infrastructure was built in the last twelve years compared to most U.S. drinking water infrastructure, which were built 50 or more years ago.

	geographical information system technologies, and supervisory control and data acquisition systems, which we use to map and monitor our physical assets and water resources on an automated, real-time basis with fewer employees than the standard water
	utility model requires. Our innovative approaches to utility planning, water conservation and technology utilization have led to our development of strong relationships with key regulatory bodies.

	FATHOM&#153;. Initially developed to support and optimize our utility operations, implementation of the FATHOM&#153; system has consistently demonstrated cost savings for third party utilities and provides opportunities for increased utility
	revenues. We sold the FATHOM&#153; business in June 2013 (retaining a minority ownership position, which is currently approximately 8%), although we continue to use and benefit from the internally developed FATHOM&#153; service suite. For additional

	We have acquired or formed 16 regulated water and wastewater utilities (four of which have subsequently been divested and three of which have
	been merged), five of which are operating with active customer service connections. We have successfully consolidated the operations, management, infrastructure, technology and employees of these utilities. Not all utilities acquired by us can
	accommodate the Total Water Management model, as it is necessary that we own both the water and the wastewater infrastructure in the area. In those cases, we seek to improve operational and administrative efficiencies of the utility using our
	technology platform and through economies of scale. We believe that our success to date engenders positive relationships and credibility with regulators, municipalities, developers and customers in both existing and prospective service areas.

	and we are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental agencies in order to operate our facilities. Regulations relate to, among other things, standards and criteria for drinking water quality and for wastewater discharges, customer
	service and service delivery standards, waste disposal and raw groundwater abstraction limits and rates and charges for our regulated services. There may be instances in the future when we are not in or cannot achieve compliance with new and
	evolving laws, regulations and permits without incurring additional operating costs. For example, in 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) implemented a new arsenic maximum contaminant level, which effectively required the
	installation and operation of costly arsenic treatment systems at many of our water production facilities.

	Our costs of complying with
	current and future governmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business or results of operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators and our
	operations could be curtailed or shut down. We may also be exposed to product liability or breach of contract claims by third parties resulting from our noncompliance. These laws and regulations are complex and change frequently, and these changes
	may cause us to incur costs in connection with the remediation of actions that were lawful when they were taken.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We may incur higher
	compliance or remediation costs than expected in any particular period and may not be able to pass those increased costs along to our customers immediately through rate increases or at all. This is because we must obtain regulatory approval to
	increase our rates, which can be time-consuming and costly and our requests for increases may not be approved in part or in full.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are
	required to test our water quality for certain parameters and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that parameters or contaminants exceed allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remedy
	the water quality or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these outcomes may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities would approve rate increases to recover these additional compliance costs. In addition,
	by the time that test results are available, contaminated water may have been provided to customers, which may result in liability for us and damage our reputation.

	ratepayers about proposed rate increases. Moreover, even if the Arizona Corporation Commission ultimately agrees that some rate relief is necessary, the relief can only be obtained after a formal and lengthy proceeding before the Arizona Corporation

	We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate water supply depends

	Drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient
	quantities to our existing and future customers. For example, our utilities have acted in the past as interim operators for several smaller troubled water systems, at the request of the Arizona Corporation Commission. In one such instance, the
	onsite well, which was the single source of water, ran dry due to aquifer decline. As a result, we were forced to haul water to the system for several years at a considerable cost. Any future interruption to our water supply or restrictions on water
	usage during drought conditions or other legal limitations on water use could result in decreased customer billing and lower revenues or higher expenses that we would not be able to recoup without prior regulatory approval for a rate increase, which
	may not be granted. See &#147;&#151;We may not be permitted to increase our rates, which may necessitate a reduction of our capital investments and operating costs.&#148; These conditions could also lead to increases in capital expenditures needed
	to build infrastructure to secure alternative water sources. Furthermore, customers may use less water even after a drought has ended because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Population growth could also decline under drought
	conditions as individuals and businesses move out of the area or elect not to relocate there. Lower water use for any reason could lead to lower revenue.

	Dilution is the difference between the offering price per share and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock
	immediately after the offering. The price you pay for shares of our common stock sold in this offering is substantially higher than our pro forma net tangible book value per share immediately after this offering. Based on an assumed initial public
	offering price of $5.75 per share (the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) for our common stock, you will incur immediate dilution in net tangible book value per share of $5.23. In addition, you may also experience
	additional dilution, or potential dilution, upon future equity issuances to investors or to our employees and directors under our equity incentive plan and any other plans we may adopt. As a result of this dilution, investors purchasing shares of
	our common stock in this offering may receive significantly less than the full purchase price that they paid for in this offering in the event of liquidation. See &#147;Dilution&#148; for additional information.

	and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. In estimating these costs, we took into account expenses related to
	insurance, legal, accounting, and compliance activities, as well as other expenses not currently incurred. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and
	officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract

	Prior to the completion of this offering, we have not had to independently comply with Section&nbsp;404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
	Section&nbsp;404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we would expect to file with the SEC.
	Additionally, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required pursuant to Section&nbsp;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness

	assumptions and conclusions may change prior to the effective time of the Reorganization Transaction and, as of the date hereof, the fair market value of the shares of our common stock held by GWRC at the time of the Reorganization Transaction
	cannot be predicted with certainty. If the fair market value of the shares of our common stock held by GWRC exceeds GWRC&#146;s adjusted basis in such shares at the time of the Reorganization Transaction, then such excess generally will be subject
	to U.S. federal income taxation. Any such tax could be material. Moreover, the IRS may disagree with our calculations of the amount of any such tax due. Accordingly, GWRC might be subject to material U.S. federal income taxation as a result of the

	For Canadian tax purposes, on the date of the Reorganization Transaction, GWRC will be deemed to have a year end and will also be deemed to
	have sold all of its property and received fair market value proceeds for those properties (which consist almost exclusively of shares of our common stock). GWRC will also be subject to an additional corporate emigration tax equal to 5% of the
	amount by which the fair market value of GWRC&#146;s property, net of liabilities, exceeds the paid-up capital of the GWRC common shares. Based on our current and expected circumstances, we do not expect GWRC to be subject to material Canadian
	taxation as a result of either the deemed disposition of all of its property or the imposition of the corporate emigration tax. That said, the facts underlying our assumptions and conclusions may change prior to the effective time of the
	Reorganization Transaction and, as of the date hereof, the fair market value of GWRC&#146;s properties at the time of the Reorganization Transaction cannot be predicted with certainty. Further, it is possible that the Canadian federal tax
	authorities may not accept the applicable valuations or calculations of GWRC&#146;s relevant tax attributes and accounts. No opinion has been or will be sought from legal counsel, and no ruling from Canadian federal tax authorities has been or will
	be applied for, respecting these matters. Accordingly, the Canadian federal tax authorities may conclude that Canadian taxes are due as a result of the Reorganization Transaction, and the amount of Canadian taxes found to be due might be material.
	If, as a result of the Reorganization Transaction, GWRC is subject to Canadian taxation as a result of either the deemed disposition of all of its property or the imposition of the corporate emigration tax, then we will be liable for any such tax
	following the Reorganization Transaction.

	By way of example only, if the trading price of our shares of common stock is used as a
	rough approximation for the fair market value of the shares of our common stock held by GWRC, then we estimate that a trading price at the time of the closing of the Reorganization Transaction of $6.00 per share would result in aggregate U.S. and
	Canadian tax liabilities to us of approximately $160,000, and a trading price of $6.50 per share would result in aggregate U.S. and Canadian tax liabilities to us of approximately $1,900,000.

	Following the consummation of this offering and the Reorganization Transaction, we plan to refinance all of our tax-exempt bonds issued through
	The Industrial Development Authority of the County of Pima. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#151;Tax Exempt Bonds&#148; for additional
	information concerning these bonds. The loan agreements relating to such bonds provide a redemption option exercisable by the Company at a price of 103% of the principal amount redeemed, plus interest accrued up to the redemption date, in the event
	of a &#147;public offering&#148; of ownership interests in the Company. This offering, once completed, will constitute a public offering of ownership interests in the Company. If we exercise this option, we must complete the redemption within 90
	days after closing of the public offering. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the principal balance of such bonds was $106.7&nbsp;million. Based on discussions with lenders, we believe we can reduce the effective interest rate on the outstanding balance
	by approximately 75 to 150 basis points. Our ability to complete the refinancing and to reduce our effective interest rate will be subject to market conditions at the time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to complete the
	refinancing in a timely manner or at all, or that, if completed, we will be able to reduce the interest rates on our debt as we expect. See &#147;Risk Factors&#151;We may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all.&#148;

	We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of our common stock that we are offering will be approximately $3.2 million, or approximately
	$4.0 million if the underwriter exercises in full its option to purchase additional shares of our common stock, assuming an initial public offering price of $5.75 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range on the cover page of this
	prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $5.75 per share would increase (decrease) the
	net proceeds to us from our initial public offering by $0.9 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions.

	Our principal reason for this offering is to provide the Company the option to exercise the redemption of its outstanding tax-exempt
	bonds, which would need to be completed within 90 days after closing of a &#147;public offering&#148; of ownership interests in the Company. See &#147;The Transactions&#151;Planned Refinancing Transaction&#148; for additional information. We intend
	to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. However, we have not made a definitive determination as to how to allocate these proceeds among these and other possible general corporate purposes
	and we do not anticipate doing so prior to the completion of this offering. We do not intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to refinance the tax-exempt bonds.

	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid cash dividends to holders of our common stock totaling $27.6&nbsp;million (which included a
	special one-time dividend of $22.8&nbsp;million paid in August 2015 to distribute to stockholders a portion of the proceeds of the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company). For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we
	paid cash dividends to holders of our common stock totaling $3.5&nbsp;million. We did not declare any dividends for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013.

	Following the completion of this offering, we intend to pay a regular monthly dividend on our common stock of $0.02 per share ($0.24 per share
	annually), or an aggregate of approximately $4.7 million on an annual basis. However, our future dividend policy is subject to our compliance with applicable law, and depending on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition,
	level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock we may issue in the future, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. See
	&#147;Risk Factors&#151;We cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.&#148;

	If you invest in our common stock, your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering
	price in this offering per share of our common stock and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock upon consummation of this offering. Net tangible book value per share represents the book value of our total

	Our pro forma net tangible book value as of December 31, 2015, was approximately $6.8&nbsp;million, or approximately $0.37 per share based on
	the 18,241,746&nbsp;shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of such date after giving effect to the Reorganization Transaction and the 100.68-for-1 forward stock split with respect to our common stock that will be effected prior to the
	completion of this offering. After giving effect to the Reorganization Transaction (including the 100.68-for-1 forward stock split) and our sale of our common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of $5.75 per share (the
	midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus), and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and estimated expenses related to this offering, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of December 31,
	2015 would have been $10.0 million, or $0.52 per share (assuming no exercise of the underwriter&#146;s option to purchase additional shares). This represents an immediate and substantial dilution of $5.23 per share to new investors purchasing common
	stock in this offering. The following table illustrates this dilution per share:

	Overview

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a water resource management company that owns, operates and manages water, wastewater and recycled water utilities in strategically
	located communities, principally in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. We seek to deploy our integrated approach, which we refer to as &#147;Total Water Management,&#148; a term we use to mean managing the entire water cycle by owning and operating the
	water, wastewater and recycled water utilities within the same geographic areas in order to both conserve water and maximize its total economic and social value. We use Total Water Management to promote sustainable communities in areas where we
	expect growth to outpace the existing potable water supply. Our model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity and applies principles of water conservation through water reclamation and reuse. Our basic premise is that the
	world&#146;s water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water and by providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices.

	Business Outlook

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	2014 and 2015 continued
	the trend of positive growth in new connections and re-establishing service on existing previously vacant homes. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Data, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area had a population of 4.2&nbsp;million in 2010 and is
	the 14th largest metropolitan statistical area in the U.S., an increase of 29% over the 3.25&nbsp;million people in the 2000 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix&#146;s growth data continues to improve due to its low-cost housing, excellent weather, large
	and growing universities, a diverse employment base and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that Maricopa County will have a population of 4.5&nbsp;million by 2020 and 6.0 million by 2040.
	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, Arizona&#146;s employment rate improved by 2.5%, ranking Arizona in the top eight states nationally for job growth.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Also, according to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus panel, most sectors of real estate are
	expected to experience improved occupancy and growth. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the W.P. Carey School of Business, using U.S. Census data, reported that after a decline to fewer than 7,400 units in 2010, single family housing
	permits bounced back to 11,821 units in 2012, and continued to climb in 2013 to 12,771 units. The same data indicated that permits for 2014 declined to approximately 11,700 units at year end. However, for the year ended December 31, 2015, permits
	were up approximately 43% to 16,768 in Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, and the forecast for 2016 remains positive at approximately 20,000 units. From there, we believe growth in the region could steadily return to its normal historical
	rate of greater than 30,000 single family dwelling permits. Additionally, multifamily, office, retail, and industrial market occupancy rates continued to increase in 2015 compared to 2014 and are expected to continue to increase through 2016.
	Phoenix was one of the worst performing housing markets during the housing downturn, but home prices have risen on average 7.85%&nbsp;per year over the past three years ending December 2015, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Phoenix Home Price
	Index.

	We believe that our acquired utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of
	growth primarily in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Market data indicates that our service areas currently incorporate a large portion of the final platted lots, partially finished lots and finished lots in metropolitan Phoenix. Management believes
	that the Company is well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services areas.

	below), total connections, including active service connections and connections to vacant homes, decreased to 38,744 as of December 31, 2015 from 45,235 as of December 31, 2014. Our active service connections decreased to 37,784 as of December 31,

	Adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water Company, we
	continue to see a positive trend in new connections combined with re-establishing service to existing homes. As illustrated in the graph below, which reflects the adjustment for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia Water
	Company, adjusted total connections totaled 38,744 as of December 31, 2015 compared to 38,262 as of December 31, 2014, which represents an increase of 482 connections, or an annualized increase of approximately 1.3%. Adjusted active connections

	We are subject to extensive regulation of our rates by the Arizona Corporation Commission, which is charged with establishing rates based on
	the provision of reliable service at reasonable cost while also providing an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on rate base for investors of utilities. The Arizona Corporation Commission uses a historical test year to evaluate whether the
	plant in service is used and useful, to assess whether costs were prudently incurred and to set &#147;just and reasonable&#148; rates. Rate base is typically the depreciated original cost of the plant in service (net of contributions in aid of
	construction and &#147;advances in aid of construction,&#148; which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a collection main extension agreement, the value of which may be refundable), that has been determined to have been
	&#147;prudently invested&#148; and &#147;used and useful,&#148; although the reconstruction cost of the utility plant may also be considered in determining the rate base. The Arizona Corporation Commission also decides on an applicable capital
	structure based on actual or hypothetical analyses. The Arizona Corporation Commission determines a &#147;rate of return&#148; on that rate base which includes the approved capital structure and the actual cost of debt and a fair and reasonable cost
	of equity based on the Arizona Corporation Commission&#146;s judgment. The overall revenue requirement for rate making purposes is established by multiplying the rate of return by the rate base, and adding &#147;prudently&#148; incurred operating
	expenses for the test year, depreciation and any applicable pro forma adjustments.

	To ensure an optimal combination of access to water and water conservation balanced with a fair
	rate of return for investors, our water utility operating revenue is based on two components: a fixed fee and a consumption or volumetric fee. For our water utilities, the fixed fee, or &#147;basic service charge,&#148; provides access to water for
	residential usage and has generally been set at a level to produce 50% of total revenue. The volumetric fee is based on the total volume of water supplied to a given customer after the minimum number of gallons, if any, covered by the basic service
	charge, multiplied by a price per gallon set by a tariff approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission. A discount to the volumetric rate applies for customers that use less than an amount specified by the Arizona Corporation Commission. For all
	investor-owned water utilities, the Arizona Corporation Commission requires the establishment of inverted tier conservation oriented rates, meaning that the price of water increases as consumption increases. For wastewater utilities, wastewater
	collection and treatment can be based on volumetric or fixed fees. Our wastewater utility services are billed based solely on a fixed fee, determined by the size of the water meter installed. Recycled water is sold on a volumetric basis with no
	fixed fee component.

	We are required to file rate cases with the Arizona Corporation Commission to obtain approval for a change in rates.
	Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take a year or more to complete. As a result, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time of a capital investment or incurrence of an operating expense increase and when those
	costs are reflected in rates. In normal conditions, it would not be uncommon to see us file for a rate increase every three years based on year one being the test year, year two being the rate case filing year and year three being the rate case
	award year. However, based on the recent settlement with the Arizona Corporation Commission and extended new rate phase-in period, we will not be initiating the next rate case on this timeline. Moving forward, we will continue to analyze all factors
	that drive the requirement for increased revenue, including our rate of investment and recurring expenses, and determine the appropriate test year for a future rate case. See &#147;&#151;Recent Rate Case Activities.&#148;

	Our water and wastewater services require significant production resources and therefore result in significant production costs. Although we

	Our most significant costs include labor, chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, and power used to operate pumps and other equipment. Power and chemical costs can be volatile. However, we employ a variety of technologies and methodologies to
	minimize costs and maximize operational efficiencies. Additionally, with our Total Water Management approach, whereby we maximize the direct beneficial reuse of recycled water, we can realize significant treatment costs and power savings because
	smaller volumes of water are required for potable use. Many utilities require that all water be treated to potable standards irrespective of use. Total Water Management focuses on the right water for the right use. Potable water is needed for
	consumption and recycled water is acceptable for non-potable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing. Non-potable water does not need to be treated for commonly occurring and regulated constituents such as arsenic, or for other current or future
	human consumption health-based contaminants.

	Our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, overuse of sources
	of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Also, customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions, particularly during the summer. Our water systems
	generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for irrigation and other outdoor uses. However, summer weather that is cooler or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water
	demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our business may be affected by government-issued drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions
	that would artificially lower customer demand and reduce our operating revenue. The limited geographic diversity of our service areas could make the results of our operations more sensitive to the effect of local weather extremes The second and
	third quarters of the year are generally those in which water services revenue and wastewater services revenue are highest. Accordingly, interim results should not be considered representative of the results of a full year.

	Whereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the
	number of active service connections has increased and continues to increase from 2011 levels, the additional revenues will be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if we experience declining usage per customer, we may not

	From 2003 to 2008, we entered into approximately 154 infrastructure coordination and
	financing agreements with developers and landowners covering approximately 275 square miles. Under these agreements, we have a contractual obligation to the developers and landowners to ensure that, amongst other things, physical capacity exists
	through our regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. We receive fees from the landowner/developer for undertaking these obligations that typically are a negotiated amount per planned equivalent dwelling
	unit for the specified development or parcel of land. Payments are generally due to us from the landowner/developer based on progress of the development, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain
	milestones, and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. Our investment can be considerable, as we may phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master
	plan, as opposed to a single development.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2010, we accounted for funds received under infrastructure
	coordination and financing agreements as revenue once the obligations specified in the agreements were met. As these arrangements are with developers and not with the end water or wastewater customer, the timing of revenue recognition coincided with
	the completion of our performance obligations under the agreement with the developer and with our ability to provide fitted capacity for water and wastewater service to the applicable development or parcel through our regulated subsidiaries. In Rate
	Decision No.&nbsp;71878 in 2010, the Arizona Corporation Commission imputed a reduction to our rate base for all amounts we collected under these agreements as the Commission deemed these payments to be contributions in aid of construction for rate
	making purposes. As a result of that decision, effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, we changed our accounting policy for the accounting of infrastructure coordination and financing agreement funds and recorded these funds received as contributions in aid
	of construction. Thereafter, the infrastructure coordination and financing agreement-related contributions in aid of construction were amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated depreciable life of the utility plant at the
	related utilities. The balance of infrastructure coordination and financing agreement related contributions in aid of construction, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $64.1 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2013.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364 in 2014, the Arizona Corporation Commission changed how infrastructure coordination and financing
	agreement funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, infrastructure coordination and financing agreement funds that we previously received would no longer be required to reduce future rates as a result of the
	ratemaking process. We have eliminated the contributions in aid of construction liability that is no longer required and reversed the associated regulatory liability brought about by Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364 by recording a gain of
	$50.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. These funds which were already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364 would be accounted for in accordance with our infrastructure coordination
	and financing agreement revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to Rate Decision No.&nbsp;71878 in 2010. For infrastructure coordination and financing agreement funds to be received in the future, Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364
	prescribes that 70% of these funds will be recorded as a hook-up fee liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, to be accounted for in accordance with our infrastructure coordination and financing agreement revenue
	recognition policy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We now account for the portion of future payments received under these agreements allocated to hook-up fee liability
	as contributions in aid of construction. However, from the regulator&#146;s perspective, hook-up fees do not impact rate base until the related funds are expended. These funds are segregated in a separate bank account and used for plant. A hook-up
	fee liability, once established, will be relieved once the funds are used for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a hook-up fee or infrastructure coordination and financing agreement, we must first use the hook-up fee funds
	received, after which we may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The 30% deferred revenue portion of these fees is recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the applicable infrastructure coordination and
	financing agreement are met.

	We have agreed to not enter into any new infrastructure coordination and financing agreements,
	and instead will utilize hook-up fee tariffs, which have become an acceptable industry practice in Arizona. As part of the settlement, a hook-up fee tariff was established for each utility. Existing infrastructure coordination and financing
	agreements will remain in place, but a portion (approximately 70%) of future payments to be received under the infrastructure coordination and financing agreements will be considered as hook-up fees, which are accounted for as contributions in aid
	of construction once expended on plant (i.e., hook-up fees will be recorded as a liability, but will only reduce rate base once such funds are expended on plant). The remaining approximate 30% of future infrastructure coordination and financing
	agreement payments will be recognized using the same income recognition accounting applied to infrastructure coordination and financing agreement funds already received, wherein such funds will be recorded as revenue or deferred revenue.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to infrastructure coordination and financing agreements, we have various line extension agreements with developers and builders,
	whereby funds, water line extensions, or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the developers and are considered refundable advances for construction. These advances in aid of construction are subject to refund by us to the developers
	through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements&#146;
	refunding period, the remaining balance of the advances in aid of construction becomes nonrefundable and at that time is considered contributions in aid of construction. Contributions in aid of construction are amortized as a reduction of
	depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, an utility plant funded by advances in aid of construction and contributions in aid of construction is excluded from rate base. For the
	year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we transferred $7.4 million of advances in aid of construction balances to contributions in aid of construction for amounts for which the refunding period had expired. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we did
	not transfer any advances in aid of construction balances to contributions in aid of construction.

	that we were entitled to approximately $4.2 million of infrastructure coordination and financing agreement fees, 15%&nbsp;per annum interest totaling $2.0 million and recovery of one-third of the legal costs incurred in connection with the
	litigation. In August 2012, we received the monies due from New World Properties, Inc. totaling $2,044,000, consisting of $1,219,000 of past due infrastructure coordination and financing agreement fees, $719,000 of interest and $106,000 of
	reimbursed litigation costs. However, subsequent to the award, Sierra Negra Ranch, LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In July 2013, the bankruptcy court ruled that Sierra Negra Ranch, LLC must cure its default in order to assume the infrastructure
	coordination and financing agreement, which would require full payment of past due infrastructure coordination and financing agreement fees, interest and reimbursement of legal costs by no later than March&nbsp;21, 2014, stating that such value

	Under the plan and settlement agreement that was approved by the court, we would receive monies due from Sierra Negra Ranch, LLC totaling $5,321,000, consisting of $2,802,000 of past due infrastructure coordination and financing agreement fees,
	$2,021,000 of interest (recorded within other income (expense) in our statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014) and $498,000 of reimbursed litigation costs, all of which was received during the first quarter of 2014.

	regulated utility services for an initial term of 10&nbsp;years. The services agreement is automatically renewable thereafter for successive 10-year periods, unless notice of termination is given prior to any renewal period. The services agreement
	may be terminated by either party for default only and the termination of the services agreement will also result in the termination of the royalty payments payable to the Company. The Company retains an approximate 8% interest in GWM at

	This &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; section contains references to
	&#147;EBITDA&#148; and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined for the purposes of this management&#146;s discussion and analysis as net income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA
	less the gain or loss related to non-recurring events. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of our operating performance and provide meaningful measures of overall corporate performance exclusive of
	our capital structure and the method and timing of expenditures associated with building and placing our systems. EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it is frequently used by investment analysts, investors and other interested
	parties as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it provides a measure of our recurring core business.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized earnings measures under generally accepted accounting principles of the United States
	(&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that EBITDA and Adjusted
	EBITDA should not be construed as an alternatives to net income or loss or other income statement data (which are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP) as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity and cash flows.
	Management&#146;s method of calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ materially from the method used by other companies and accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

	December&nbsp;31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The decrease in salary, bonus and benefit expense is primarily due to a decrease of approximately $821,000 related to the completion of our executive transition plan,
	wherein we no longer accrue and pay a salary and bonus to Mr.&nbsp;Hill and Ms.&nbsp;Bowers, who now serve as directors of the Company. The decrease related to our executive transition plan is inclusive of $300,000 of cash bonus payments made in
	lieu of phantom stock units (&#147;PSUs&#148;) in 2014 that did not occur in 2015, which were made to reduce the potential exposure to an increase in deferred compensation expense resulting from PSU re-measurement corresponding to an increase in
	share price. This decrease is partially offset by a one-time bonus of $591,000 for members of management holding stock appreciation rights at the time of the special dividend paid out in August 2015, combined with a $65,000 increase in labor
	capitalized to ongoing projects.

	date, will be the market value of the equivalent number of shares of GWRC at that date. The issuance of PSUs as a core component of employee compensation was intended to strengthen the alignment of interests between our employees and the
	shareholders of GWRC by linking their holdings and a portion of their compensation to the future value of the common shares of GWRC. The PSU Plan will remain in effect following the Reorganization Transaction and this offering, provided that the

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had notable near-term cash expenditure obligations.
	Most significantly, the Company has approximately $9.0 million of debt interest and principal payments due before December&nbsp;31, 2016. While specific facts and circumstances could change, we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and will
	be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our required debt service and operating cash flow requirements as well as remain in compliance with our debt covenants until at least December&nbsp;31, 2016.

	The application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations
	and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments. Additionally, the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flow are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates
	used in the application of critical accounting policies. Although the Company&#146;s management believes that these estimates, assumptions and other judgments are appropriate, they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change
	in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations as reflected in
	the Company&#146;s financial statements. For further discussion of the Company&#146;s accounting policies and estimates, see the notes to the Company&#146;s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.

	operations and changing the disclosures for disposals that meet the definition under the new guidance. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in a company&#146;s strategy would be deemed a discontinued operation. To
	meet the definition of strategic shift, the disposal should have a major effect on the organization&#146;s operations and financial results. Examples of the type of disposals that would qualify as a discontinued operation include a disposal of a
	major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment. For those disposals that meet the criteria, expanded disclosures on assets, liabilities, income and expenses would apply. The Company&#146;s adoption of ASU
	2014-08 in the first quarter of 2015 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers,&#148;
	which completes the joint effort between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board to converge the recognition of revenue between the two boards. The new standard affects any entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts
	with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets not included within other FASB standards. The guiding principal of the new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue in an amount
	that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for the delivery of goods and services. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted using either of two acceptable methods: (1)&nbsp;retrospective adoption to each prior period presented with
	the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (2)&nbsp;adoption with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain disclosures. To assess at which time revenue should be recognized, an entity should
	use the following steps: (1)&nbsp;identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2)&nbsp;identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3)&nbsp;determine the transaction price; (4)&nbsp;allocate the transaction price to the performance
	obligations in the contract; and (5)&nbsp;recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. For public business entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017,
	including interim periods within the reporting period. For private companies, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, and interim reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2019. Earlier
	application allowed in certain circumstances. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance may have on our consolidated financial position.

	an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,&#148; which defines management&#146;s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about an organizations ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard provides
	that an entity&#146;s management should evaluate whether conditions or events exist that would raise substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. If substantial doubt exists, the guidance provides principles and
	definitions to assist management in assessing the appropriate timing and content in their financial statement disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected

	periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 will require the Company to reclassify debt issuance costs retrospectively beginning January&nbsp;1, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact that

	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, &#147;Income Taxes:
	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,&#148; which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the classified statement of financial position. The purpose of this update is to simplify the presentation
	of deferred liabilities and assets. For public business entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.&nbsp;For private companies, the ASU is effective
	for financial statements for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual&nbsp;periods beginning after December 15, 2018.&nbsp;Early application is permitted for all entities as&nbsp;of the beginning of an

	The Company has historically accounted for compensation expense related to its liability-classified stock appreciation
	rights (&#147;SARs&#148;) using the intrinsic value method, as permitted by ASC 718 for nonpublic entities, with changes to the value of the SARs recognized as compensation expense at each quarterly reporting date. Upon becoming a public company, as
	defined in ASC 718, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company is required to change its methodology for valuing the SARs. While the SARs will continue to be re-measured at each quarterly reporting date, the SARs are required to be accounted for
	prospectively at fair value using a fair value pricing model, such as Black-Scholes. The Company plans to record the impact of the change in valuation methods as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, as permitted by ASC 250. The

	in the southwestern region of the United States. Global Water Management, LLC (&#147;GWM&#148;) was formed as an affiliated company to provide business development, management, construction project management, operations, and administrative services

	In early 2010, the members of GWR made the decision to raise money through the capital
	markets, and GWR and GWM were reorganized to form the Delaware corporation that we are today. The members established a new entity, GWR Global Water Resources Corp. (&#147;GWRC&#148;), which was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act
	(British Columbia) on March&nbsp;23, 2010 to acquire shares of our common stock and to actively participate in our management, business and operations through its representation on our board of directors and its shared management. On
	December&nbsp;30, 2010, GWRC completed its initial public offering in Canada and its common shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

	Significant Constraints on the Availability of Fresh Water
</I>
	. In Arizona, the Arizona Department of Water Resources estimates that annual water usage is 6.96&nbsp;million acre-fee per year. Arizona has the right to
	use 2.8&nbsp;million acre-feet from the Colorado River and approximately half of that can be delivered through the Central Arizona Project, a 336 mile diversion canal from the Colorado River to central Arizona. The Colorado River is presently
	over-allocated, which means that more surface water right allocations have been issued than the actual average annual flow, with allocations being determined based on data from a period during which flows were significantly higher than in recent
	years. The Central Arizona Project is the only means of transporting Colorado River water into central Arizona. Approximately 43% of the water used in Arizona comes from groundwater. Water in the western United States is being pumped from
	groundwater sources faster than it is replenished naturally, a condition known as overdraft. In areas of water scarcity, such as the arid western United States, water recycling represents a relatively simple, inexpensive and energy-efficient means
	of augmenting water supply as compared to transporting surface water, groundwater or desalinated water from other locations. Approximately 70% of the water provided by municipalities is currently used for non-potable applications where recycled
	water could potentially be utilized.

	Lack of Technology Utilization to Increase Operating Efficiencies and Decrease Operating Costs
</I>
	. The U.S. water industry has traditionally not taken advantage of advances in technology available to enhance
	revenue, increase operating efficiencies and decrease operating costs (including labor and energy costs). Areas of opportunity include automated meter reading, systems management and administrative functions, such as customer billing and remittance
	systems. Key drivers for the lack of investment in technology in water and wastewater utilities have been the historical lack of incentives offered or standards imposed by regulators to achieve efficiencies and lower costs and the ownership of the
	U.S. water utility sector, which largely consists of small, undercapitalized, municipally-owned utilities that lack the financial and technical resources to pursue technology opportunities.

	Municipal water utilities typically fund their capital expenditure needs through user-based water and wastewater rates, municipal taxes or the
	issuance of bonds. However, raising large amounts of funds required for capital investment is often challenging for municipal water utilities, which affects their ability to fund capital spending. Many smaller utilities also do not have the in-house

	We believe investor-owned utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary
	infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater utilities, addressing increasingly stringent environmental and human health standards and navigating a wide variety of regulatory processes. In addition, investor-owned utilities that achieve
	larger scales are able to spread overhead expenses over a larger customer base, thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer. Since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale and sharing

	For example, the Company&#146;s water recycling model has been fully implemented in the City of Maricopa. The Company is the water, wastewater and recycled water provider for the City of Maricopa, which currently has a
	population of approximately 46,000. A community of this size produces approximately an annual average of 2.4&nbsp;million gallons of wastewater per day. Because the Company requires developers to take back and utilize recycled water within their
	communities and invest in &#147;purple pipe&#148; recycled water infrastructure during the initial development of subdivisions, the Company is now able to distribute almost all of the 2.4&nbsp;million gallons back to the community for beneficial
	purposes. Approximately 60% of the recycled water goes towards common area non-potable irrigation, and the remaining 40% is either discharged for agricultural purposes at a local farming facility or into an existing dry river bed, which allows for
	the recycled water to naturally recharge into the aquifer. This reduces the total amount of limited ground or surface water that would otherwise be required within the community by over 25%. To date, the Company has reused 5.4 billion gallons of
	recycled water in the City of Maricopa.

	to the utility, and sometimes to customers, through a simple user interface. Reading meters at this frequency provides many benefits to both the utility and the customer. With this data, utilities can better model demand usage, identify system water
	loss, identify leaks on the customer side of the meter, monitor for abnormal usage, and present interval, daily, weekly or monthly usage back to the customers.

	A key component of our water utility business is the use of recycled water. Recycled water is highly treated and purified wastewater that is

	approximately 2,000 homes) from December 2009 to December 2015. Development in the area is considered to be affordable and represents one of the few areas within the United States where a new home can be purchased from the mid $100,000s.

	We acquired Santa Cruz and Palo Verde in 2004. Santa Cruz serves 18,034 active service connections as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and revenues
	from Santa Cruz represented approximately 34.4% and 36.8% of our total revenue for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Palo Verde serves 17,820 active service connections as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and revenues from Palo
	Verde represented approximately 43.3% and 47.0% of our total revenue for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.

	The Santa Cruz and Palo Verde service areas include approximately 175 square miles, which we believe provide further opportunities for growth
	once development returns to these areas and water and wastewater utility services are required. Most of the Santa Cruz and Palo Verde infrastructure is less than ten years old, and all of it is less than fifteen years old. Santa Cruz and Palo Verde
	provide water and wastewater services, respectively, under an innovative public- private partnership memorandum of understanding with the City of Maricopa in Pinal County for approximately 278 square miles of its planning area. We signed a similar
	memorandum of understanding with the City of Casa Grande to partner in providing water, wastewater, and recycled water services to an approximate 100 square miles of its western region for anticipated growth.

	Rate proceedings were completed in 2010 for both Santa Cruz and Palo Verde. In July 2012, these two utilities filed applications with the
	Arizona Corporation Commission for increased rates using 2011 as the test year on which the Arizona Corporation Commission will use to evaluate the utilities&#146; rates. The rate proceedings were completed in February 2014. See

	We acquired CP Water Company (&#147;CP Water&#148;) in 2006. CP Water provided water service within parts of Pinal County. CP Water received a
	Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for approximately two square miles of service area in 1984 and currently has 13 active service connections. We acquired this small utility as part of our consolidation strategy to enable the deployment of new
	integrated infrastructure as development occurs in the corridor between the cities of Maricopa and Casa Grande. CP Water&#146;s service area, customers and assets have been transferred to Santa Cruz.

	a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, which allows them to serve customers within a geographic area specified by a legal description of the property. In considering an application for a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, the Arizona
	Corporation Commission will determine if the applicant is fit and proper to provide service within a specified area, whether the applicant has sufficient technical, managerial and financial capabilities to provide the service and if that service is
	necessary and in the public interest. Once a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity is granted, the utility falls under the Arizona Corporation Commission&#146;s jurisdiction and must abide by the rules and laws by which a public service

	We intend to seek access to renewable water supplies as we grow our water resource portfolio. However, we currently rely almost exclusively
	(and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. Aside from some rights to water through the Central Arizona
	Project, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the only water supply available to us.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although we intend to rely
	on recycled water to help meet water demands in areas, the infrastructure, permits, and customer base necessary to generate and deliver recycled water are not necessarily in place in most of our service areas. In addition, although recycling can
	extend a limited supply, it does not actually generate a new supply of water. As such, although our proposed generation and delivery of recycled water is likely to help substantially reduce the amount of groundwater that will be required to serve
	future customers, our ability to serve new customers will remain dependent on its ability to access groundwater. Groundwater is a limited resource in Arizona, and access to new uses of groundwater is closely regulated in the areas served by us. See
	&#147;Risk Factors&#151;Inadequate water and wastewater supplies could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to achieve the customer growth necessary to increase our revenues.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Nearly all of our service areas are located in &#147;Active Management Areas,&#148; areas within which the use of groundwater is regulated by
	the Arizona Department of Water Resources in order to manage ongoing problems with groundwater overdraft. The Phoenix, Prescott and Tucson Active Management Areas are legally mandated to achieve &#147;safe yield&#148; by 2025 or sooner. However, we
	do not expect any of these Active Management Areas to achieve their safe yield goals. Safe yield requires groundwater pumping to not draw down the groundwater aquifers, or &#147;over-draft,&#148; as all pumping is offset or replaced within the
	Active Management Area from a renewable supply. The Pinal Active Management Area, which encompasses our major service areas near Maricopa, is managed to allow development of non-irrigation uses and to preserve existing agricultural economies in the
	Active Management Area for as long as feasible, consistent with the necessity to preserve future water supplies for non-irrigation uses.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under Arizona&#146;s assured water supply laws and regulations, a new subdivision inside an Active Management Area must demonstrate that it
	has an &#147;assured water supply&#148; to the satisfaction of the Arizona Department of Water Resources before the developer is permitted to sell lots. Demonstration of an assured water supply requires, among other things, that an applicant
	demonstrate that water supplies will be physically, continuously, and legally available to satisfy the water needs of the proposed use for at least 100 years. A developer may make an independent showing of an assured water supply (resulting in a
	Certificate of Assured Water Supply for a subdivision) or may obtain a written commitment for service from a designated water supplier, such as a privately owned water company or a municipal water supplier. Under the latter approach, the water
	supplier must demonstrate satisfaction of assured water supply requirements for the developments within its service areas (resulting in a Designation of Assured Water Supply for the provider). At present, we have obtained a Designation of Assured
	Water Supply in the Maricopa/Casa Grande service territory (Santa Cruz) for approximately 22,900 acre-feet of groundwater use. A Designation of Assured Water Supply is subject to periodic review and renewal by the Arizona Department of Water
	Resources, and can be increased as demand grows within the service territory, subject to the physical availability of water. A recent physical availability determination for Santa Cruz suggests that, over time, its Designation of Assured Water
	Supply could potentially be increased to approximately 45,000 acre-feet once sufficient increased demand is established in the area, assuming that water is still physically available by that time (i.e., the groundwater has not been committed to
	users in surrounding areas). Under our high efficiency Total Water Management model, which is intended to achieve much lower per-unit potable water use rates than would be expected for average developments, 45,000 acre-feet could be sufficient water
	supply for approximately 180,000 homes per year.

	In our West Valley service territory (Greater Tonopah), we expect to receive a

	Outside of Arizona&#146;s Active Management Areas, the &#147;adequate water supply&#148; program requires a determination of whether
	there is an adequate water supply&#151;similar to an assured water supply&#151;but it does not necessarily foreclose development when the showing cannot be made. Unless the county government has voted to make the requirement mandatory, a development
	(outside of Active Management Areas) that cannot demonstrate access to an adequate water supply is generally required only to disclose this fact, although as a practical matter few developments have proceeded on this basis. In addition, whether a
	water provider to such a development has access to an adequate water supply is nevertheless relevant to its business.

	Due to

	including submitting vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government. We have complied with EPA regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the EPA as required. Vulnerability assessments are conducted
	regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility. Information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to
	company information systems, assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation, ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements. In addition, communication plans have been developed
	as a component of our procedures. While we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water

	Our executive compensation program is designed to retain, motivate and reward our NEOs and other executive

	performance objectives, and to align the interests of our NEOs and other executive officers with those of our stockholders by rewarding the creation of long-term value through equity-linked compensation. We tie individual goals to the area of the
	NEO&#146;s primary responsibility. These goals may include the achievement of specific financial or business development goals. We set corporate performance goals that reach across various business areas and include achievements in finance/business
	development and corporate development.

	issuance to the extent not specified in an NEO&#146;s employment agreement. Stock options are issued under the stock option plan approved by GWRC&#146;s shareholders at the 2012 GWRC annual and special meeting (the &#147;GWRC Stock Option

	Long-term incentive awards are provided through PSUs, the GWRC Stock Option Plan, and SARs, each as described below. The compensation committee, together with our board of directors, sets objectives and targets based on our performance. Previous
	grants are not necessarily taken into account when considering new grants. The PSUs awarded to our NEOs during 2014 and 2015 are discussed above. The only other long-term incentive awards made in 2014 and 2015 were the SAR awards made to Messrs.

	We have adopted a phantom stock unit plan (the &#147;PSU Plan&#148;) authorizing our Board to issue PSUs to our employees, including our NEOs.
	The value of the PSUs issued under the PSU Plan (including PSUs granted pursuant to our annual Incentive Programs, as described above) tracks the performance of GWRC&#146;s common shares and provides the holder the right to receive a cash payment,
	the value of which will be the market value of the equivalent number of common shares at the maturity date. PSU awards are generally credited with additional PSUs in respect of dividends issued on the common shares. If dividends are credited, the
	number of additional PSUs credited to the awards would be equal to the aggregate amount of the dividends that would have been paid to the participant if the PSUs subject to the award had been common shares divided by the market value of a common
	share on the date on which the dividends are paid. The PSUs vest immediately upon a change of control with respect to the Company if a participant is terminated without cause or terminates employment for &#147;good reason&#148; within 12 months
	following a change of control of the Company. There is no exercise price attached to the awards.

	The directors of the Company are also reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred for
	attending board and committee meetings. The independent directors of the Company that were entitled to compensation in 2015 were L. Rita Theil, Richard M. Alexander and David C. Tedesco. Mr.&nbsp;Levine, who is neither an independent director nor an
	employee, receives an annual retainer and meeting attendance fees for his role as a director. Mr.&nbsp;Hill began to receive an annual retainer and meeting attendance fees for his role as Chairman of the board of directors for the Company in 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	Company has adopted a deferred phantom unit plan (the &#147;DPU Plan&#148;) authorizing the directors of the Company to grant DPUs to independent directors who are residents of Canada. DPUs are units whose value tracks the performance of GWRC&#146;s
	common shares and give rise to a right to receive a cash payment, the value of which, on a particular date, will be the market value of the equivalent number of GWRC common shares at that date. Holders of DPUs are credited with dividend equivalents
	when and if dividends are paid on the common shares using the market value of the GWRC common shares on the trading day immediately prior to the dividend record date. DPUs granted to directors are fully vested upon the grant date. In order to align
	their interests with the interest of shareholders, an independent director is only permitted to redeem his/her DPUs upon ceasing to be a director of the Company. The board of directors of the Company believes that this feature of the plan will
	result in directors taking a long-term view of stockholder value. Additionally, directors will not be in a position to profit from unit volatility. The board of directors of the Company believes that the issuance of DPUs as a core component of the
	independent directors&#146; compensation strengthens the alignment of interests between the independent directors and the stockholder by linking their holdings and a portion of their annual retainer to the future value of the GWRC common shares.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Following the Reorganization Transaction, we anticipate that the Company&#146;s director compensation program will remain in effect as
	summarized above. A separate DPU Plan that is sponsored by GWRC will be assumed by the Company, and the Company intends for such plan to remain in effect. The Company also intends for the DPU Plan that is sponsored by the Company to remain in effect
	following the Reorganization Transaction. From and after the Reorganization Transaction, the value of the DPUs will track the value of the Company&#146;s common stock.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After the closing of this offering and the Reorganization Transaction, the Company anticipates that new equity awards will be granted on a one
	time basis to our non-employee directors to incentivize them to continue serving on our board of directors following the registration of our common stock under the Exchange Act and the Company&#146;s listing on NASDAQ. Such equity awards may be
	granted in the form of stock options issued under the GWRC Stock Option Plan (which will be assumed by the Company in connection with the closing), or in the form of DPUs issued under the Company&#146;s Deferred Phantom Stock Unit Plan, or through a
	combination of stock options and DPUs. Our board of directors has not taken any action regarding the anticipated equity awards described above, and no such action will be taken until after the closing.

	Sale of Global Water Management, LLC
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On June&nbsp;5, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement (the &#147;Securities Purchase Agreement&#148;) and sold its wholly-owned
	subsidiary, GWM, to an investor group led by a private equity firm which specializes in the water industry. GWM owns and operates the FATHOM&#153; business. The transaction was effected through the sale of all of the outstanding membership interests
	of GWM to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the FATHOM Partnership. The Company received the following consideration for the sale of GWM: (a)&nbsp;a cash payment of $4.25 million (which was subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment of $1.7
	million paid by us); and (b)&nbsp;the issuance to the Company of common and preferred units of the FATHOM Partnership valued at approximately $0.8 million. In addition, we are entitled to quarterly royalty payments based on a percentage of certain
	of GWM&#146;s recurring revenues for a 10-year period, up to a maximum of $15.0 million. In 2014, we received an aggregate of $272,000 of such royalty payments, and we received $326,000 of such royalty payments in 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	GWM has historically provided billing, customer service and other support services for our regulated utilities business whereby FATHOM&#153;
	service fees charged to our regulated utilities were eliminated upon consolidation. In conjunction with the Securities Purchase Agreement, we entered into a services agreement with GWM whereby we agreed to use the FATHOM&#153; platform for all of
	our regulated utility services for an initial term of 10 years. The services agreement is automatically renewable thereafter for successive 10-year periods, unless notice of termination is given prior to any renewal period. The services agreement
	may be terminated by either party for default only and the termination of the services agreement will also result in the termination of the royalty payments payable to us. In 2014, we paid $2.4 million to GWM for FATHOM&#153; service fees, and we
	paid approximately $2.2 million to GWM for FATHOM&#153; service fees in 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Concurrent with the closing, we invested $750,000 of the
	cash portion of the purchase price in a convertible promissory note issued by GWM&#146;s parent. The promissory note was due December&nbsp;31, 2014, bore interest at a rate of 10%&nbsp;per annum and was convertible into equity of the FATHOM
	Partnership. We converted the convertible promissory note into equity of the FATHOM Partnership, as part of FATHOM Partnership&#146;s refinancing transaction in November 2014.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We continue to hold an indirect interest in GWM through our ownership of the common and preferred units of the FATHOM Partnership received in
	consideration for the sale of GWM. Together, these units currently represent an approximate 8.0% ownership interest in the FATHOM Partnership (on a fully diluted basis). Trevor Hill, who is the Chairman of our board of directors, currently has an
	executive director role with GWM and owns an approximate 12% interest.

	In connection with GWRC&#146;s initial public offering in Canada, on December&nbsp;30, 2010, we entered into a management agreement (the
	&#147;Management Agreement&#148;) with GWRC. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we agreed to provide substantially all necessary administrative and management services to GWRC and to pay for all fees and other expenses related to the
	administration of GWRC and its public company reporting in Canada and other compliance requirements. In 2014, we paid an aggregate of $505,000 of such fees and expenses, and we paid $1,400,000 of such fees and expenses in 2015. We are not entitled
	to any fee for our services from GWRC under the Management Agreement. The Management Agreement will be terminated on consummation of this offering.

	distributions with respect to shares of our common stock will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.
	Dividends will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, unless such rate is reduced by an applicable income tax treaty. To the extent that the amount of a distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the
	distribution will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the Non-U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock, which will reduce such basis dollar-for-dollar. Any excess distribution thereafter
	will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of which is discussed below under &#147;&#151;Gain on Disposition.&#148; To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a Non-U.S. Holder must
	provide the applicable withholding agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable or successor form) certifying qualification for the reduced rate. Dividends that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or

	Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may also be subject to a &#147;branch profits tax&#148; at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable tax treaty) of its &#147;effectively connected earnings and profits,&#148; subject

	We believe that we currently are a USRPHC and will continue to be a USRPHC for the foreseeable future. As a USRPHC, as long as shares of our
	common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market, shares of our common stock will be treated as a U.S. real property interest only with respect to a Non-U.S. Holder that actually or constructively owns more than 5% of shares of
	our common stock at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition of, or the holder&#146;s holding period for, shares of our common stock. Because the shares of our common stock will be listed on the NASDAQ,
	shares of our common stock are expected to be regularly traded on an established securities market. However, no assurance can be provided in this regard. If any gain on a Non-U.S. Holder&#146;s disposition of shares of our common stock is taxable
	because we are a USRPHC and such Non-U.S. Holder&#146;s ownership of shares of our common stock exceeds 5%, then such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be taxed on such disposition in the manner applicable to U.S. persons. That is, the holder will
	generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between (i)&nbsp;such holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the stock sold, and (ii)&nbsp;the amount realized in connection with such disposition, and have a U.S. tax obligation respecting such
	gain as well as a tax return filing obligation related thereto. In addition, a corporate Non-U.S. Holder of our common stock may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable
	income tax treaty), as adjusted for certain items. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Non-U.S. Holder that is a &#147;qualified foreign pension fund&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;897(l) of the IRC generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal

	and commissions set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. We intend to apply to have the common stock listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol &#147;GWRS.&#148;

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have granted the underwriter an option to buy up to 150,000 additional shares of our common stock at the public offering price, less the
	underwriting discounts and commissions set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, to cover over-allotments, if any. The underwriter may exercise this option at any time, in whole or in part, during the 30-day period after the date of this
	prospectus. If any additional shares of common stock are purchased, the underwriter will offer the additional shares on the same terms as those on which the shares are being offered.

	The
	underwriter proposes to offer the shares of our common stock purchased pursuant to the underwriting agreement to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and to certain dealers at that price less a

	In connection with the sale of the shares of our common stock to be purchased by the underwriter, the underwriter will be deemed to have
	received compensation in the form of underwriting commissions and discounts. The underwriter&#146;s commissions and discounts will be 7.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering, or

	for (i)&nbsp;all reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses not to exceed $150,000 and (ii)&nbsp;all other out-of-pocket fees and expenses, including any expenses relating to the clearance of this offering with FINRA. We estimate that total
	expenses of this offering, including registration, filing, listing and printing fees, legal and accounting expenses and reimbursement of the underwriter&#146;s fees and expenses (but excluding the underwriting discounts and commissions), will be

	Over-allotment involves sales by the underwriter of shares in excess of the number of shares the underwriter is obligated to purchase, which creates a syndicate short position. The short position may be either a covered

	short position, the number of shares involved is greater than the number of shares in the option to purchase additional shares. The underwriter may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares
	and/or purchasing shares in the open market.

	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to
	close out the short position, the underwriter will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the option to purchase additional
	shares. A naked short position occurs if the underwriter sells more shares than could be covered by the option to purchase additional shares. This position can only be closed out by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more
	likely to be created if the underwriter is concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

	We have audited the
	accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Water Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders&#146;
	equity, and cash flows for each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
	statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
	States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an
	audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
	expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
	in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
	opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Global Water
	Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	principally in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. The Company&#146;s model focuses on the broad issues of water supply and scarcity and applies principles of water conservation through water reclamation and reuse. The Company&#146;s basic premise is
	that the world&#146;s water supply is limited and yet can be stretched significantly through effective planning, the use of recycled water and by providing individuals and communities resources that promote wise water usage practices. The Company
	deploys its integrated approach, Total Water Management (&#147;TWM&#148;), a term which it uses to mean managing the entire water cycle, both to conserve water and to maximize its total economic and social value. The Company uses TWM to promote
	sustainable communities in areas where it expects growth to outpace the existing potable water supply.

	provide business development, management, construction project management, operations, and administrative services to GWR and all of its regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated utilities are regulated by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On February 4, 2004, GWR purchased its first two utilities, Santa Cruz Water Company, LLC
	(&#147;Santa Cruz&#148;) and Palo Verde Utilities Company, LLC (&#147;Palo Verde&#148;). Santa Cruz and Palo Verde provide water and wastewater operations, respectively, to residential and commercial customers in the vicinity of the City of Maricopa
	in Pinal County, Arizona and are regulated by the ACC. Effective March&nbsp;31, 2005, GWR purchased the assets of Sonoran Utility Services, LLC (&#147;Sonoran&#148;), an unregulated utility. The Sonoran assets were used to provide water and
	wastewater operations to residential and commercial customers in a water improvement district and a wastewater improvement district adjacent to the service area of Santa Cruz and Palo Verde. The Sonoran assets were contributed to Santa Cruz and Palo
	Verde upon acquisition.

	&#151;In early 2010, the members of GWR and GWM made the decision to
	raise money through the capital markets. The members established a new entity, GWR Global Water Resources Corp. (&#147;GWRC&#148;), which was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) to acquire shares of the Company. On
	December&nbsp;30, 2010, GWRC completed its initial public offering in Canada (the &#147;Offering&#148;) on the Toronto Stock Exchange, raising gross proceeds totaling C$65,659,583 (including gross proceeds received January&nbsp;28, 2011 of
	C$4,272,083 pursuant to the underwriters&#146; exercise of their over-allotment option). The proceeds of the Offering were used to acquire a 48.1% interest in the Company.

	As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; as
	defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#147;JOBS Act&#148;), under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced
	reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. We elected to take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We have
	elected to take advantage of some of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding financial statements. Also, as an emerging growth company we can elect to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the
	JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of this extended accounting transition provision.

	required in the WMAs, which work had been completed prior to January&nbsp;1, 2014. As the engineering work has been completed, the Company effectively has no further obligations under the WMAs, MXAs or the Transfer of Project Agreement.&nbsp;Prior
	to January&nbsp;1, 2014, the Company had received $2.8 million of proceeds and recognized income of approximately $3.3 million within other income (expense) in the statement of operations related to the gain on sale of these agreements and the
	proceeds received prior to January&nbsp;1, 2014 for engineering work required in the WMAs.&nbsp;The Company received additional proceeds of approximately $296,000 in April&nbsp;2015 and recognized those amounts as income at that time.&nbsp;Receipt

	On May&nbsp;11, 2015, GWR Global Water Resources Corp.
	(&#147;GWRC&#148;) received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (&#147;TSX&#148;) to repurchase, for cancellation, common shares of GWRC pursuant to a normal course issuer bid (&#147;NCIB&#148;). The NCIB enables GWRC to repurchase up to 87,500
	common shares, representing approximately 1% of GWRC&#146;s 8,754,612 issued and outstanding common shares as of May 5, 2015. The NCIB commenced on May&nbsp;13, 2015 and was completed on December&nbsp;30, 2015. Except as permitted under TSX rules,
	daily purchases were limited to a maximum of 3,239 common shares other than block purchase exemptions, which represented 25% of the average daily trading volume on the TSX for the six months ended April&nbsp;30, 2015. All purchases under the NCIB
	were made on the open market through the facilities of the TSX by a participating organization. The actual number of shares purchased and the timing of such purchases was determined by GWRC considering market conditions, stock prices, its cash
	position and other factors. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, GWRC repurchased 87,500 shares of stock for a total of $464,000. GWRI&#146;s outstanding shares as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 are 181,179 compared to 182,050 as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014. The Company repurchased 871 common shares held by GWRC in connection with GWRC&#146;s repurchases under its NCIB, which reduced GWRC&#146;s ownership interest in GWRI from 48.1% to 47.8%.

	&#151;Water services revenues are recorded when
	service is rendered or water is delivered to customers. However, in addition to the monthly basic service charge, the determination and billing of water sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a
	systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each reporting period, amounts of water delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding accrued, but unbilled revenue is recorded.

	Water connection fees are the fees associated with the application process to set up a customer to receive utility service on an existing water
	meter. These fees are approved by the ACC through the regulatory process and are set based on the costs incurred to establish services including the application process, billing setup, initial meter reading and service transfer. Because the amounts
	charged for water connection fees are set by our regulator and not negotiated in conjunction with the pricing of ongoing water service, the connection fees represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and are recognized when the service
	is provided. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company recognized $276,000 and $366,000 in connection fees, respectively.

	Income Taxes
</I>
	&#151;The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
	Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
	respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are
	reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company&#146;s valuation allowance totaled $8,500 as of December&nbsp;31,
	2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014 (see Note&nbsp;11).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We evaluate uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one)
	occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that more-likely-than-not will be realized upon
	settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when we subsequently determine that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. The use of a valuation allowance as a
	substitute for derecognition of tax positions is prohibited, and to the extent that uncertain tax positions exist, we provide expanded disclosures.

	Goodwill
</I>
	&#151;Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
	acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually on October&nbsp;1 and more frequently if circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level. The
	goodwill impairment model is a two-step process. First, it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them. We use the terminal valuation method in estimating fair
	value which assumes a business will be sold at the end of the projection period at a specific terminal value. Earnings and discounted cash flows were developed from our internal forecasts. Additionally, management must make an estimate of a
	weighted-average cost of capital to be used as a company-specific discount rate, which takes into account certain risk and size premiums, risk-free yields, and the capital structure of the industry. We have also considered other qualitative and
	quantitative factors including the regulatory environment that can significantly impact future earnings and cash flows and the effects of the volatile current economic environment. Changes in these projections or estimates could result in a
	reporting unit either passing or failing the first step in the goodwill impairment model.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the fair value of a reporting unit is
	determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired, and if so, the amount of such impairment. In this process, an implied fair value for goodwill is estimated by allocating the fair value of the
	reporting unit to the applicable reporting unit&#146;s assets and liabilities resulting in any excess fair value representing the implied fair value of goodwill. The amount by which carrying value exceeds the implied fair value represents the amount
	of goodwill impairment (see Note 7).

	&#151;Intangible assets not subject to amortization consist of certain

	Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more often if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Amortized intangible assets consist primarily of acquired ICFA

	Pursuant to Rate Decision No. 71878 issued by the ACC on September&nbsp;15, 2010 for the February&nbsp;2009 filed rate
	cases for Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Valencia, Greater Buckeye, Greater Tonopah and Willow Valley (the &#147;2010 Regulatory Rate Decision&#148;), ICFA funds received were accounted for as CIAC. The Company established a regulatory liability against
	the Company&#146;s intangible assets balance to offset the value of the intangible assets related to the expected receipt of ICFA fees in the future.&nbsp;As of January&nbsp;1, 2014 the Company had a regulatory liability balance of $11.4 million.
	However, in 2014, in conjunction with Rate Decision No. 74364, the ACC determined that ICFA funds were no longer to be recorded as CIAC, but rather approximately 70% of funds received should be recorded as HUF, with the remaining 30% to be deferred
	and recognized according to the Company&#146;s ICFA revenue recognition policy (see Note&nbsp;3).&nbsp;Accordingly, in 2014 30%, or $3.4 million, of the regulatory liability was reversed in connection with the recognition of the rate decision.

	believe are directly attributable to realizing the proceeds of the debt issued. These costs are capitalized in other assets and amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the respective debt. Amortization of
	debt issuance costs and discounts totaled $486,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, of which $282,000 was for the write off of debt issuance costs related to the MidFirst loan which was retired in July&nbsp;2015, and $204,000 was for the
	current year amortization.&nbsp;Amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts totaled $1.0 million for the year ended

	Impairment of Long-Lived
	Assets
</I>
	&#151;Management evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If an indicator of possible impairment
	exists, an undiscounted cash flow analysis would be prepared to determine whether there is an actual impairment.&nbsp;Measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Generally, fair value will be determined using
	appraisals or valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows.

	Advances and Contributions in Aid of
	Construction
</I>
	&#151;The Company has various agreements with Developers and builders, whereby funds, water line extensions, or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the Developers and are considered refundable advances for construction.
	These advances in aid of construction (&#147;AIAC&#148;) are
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-interest-bearing
</FONT>
	and are subject to refund to the Developers through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross
	revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements&#146; refunding period, the remaining balance of the advance becomes nonrefundable and at that
	time is considered CIAC. CIAC are amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, utility plant funded by advances and contributions in aid of construction
	are excluded from rate base. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company transferred $7.4 million of AIAC balances to CIAC for amounts for which the refunding period had expired. No AIAC balances were transferred to CIAC for the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	Fair Value of Financial Instruments
</I>
	&#151;The carrying values of cash equivalents, trade receivables,
	and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. See Note 10 for information as to the fair value of our long-term debt. Our refundable AIAC have a carrying value of $61.5 million and $89.2 million
	as of&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, respectively.&nbsp;Portions of these non-interest-bearing instruments are payable annually through 2032 and amounts not paid by the contract expiration dates become nonrefundable. Their
	relative fair values cannot be accurately estimated because future refund payments depend on several variables, including new customer connections, customer consumption levels, and future rate increases. However, the fair value of these amounts
	would be less than their carrying value due to the non-interest-bearing feature.

<I>
	Asset Retirement Obligations
</I>
	&#151;Liabilities for
	asset retirement obligations are typically recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
	Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded
	amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Our legal obligations for retirement reflect principally the retirement of wastewater treatment facilities, which are required to be closed in accordance with the Clean Closure Requirements of the
	Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). The Clean Closure Requirements of ADEQ for wastewater facilities are driven by a need to protect the environment from inadvertent contamination associated with the decommissioning of these systems.
	As such, our regulated subsidiaries incur asset retirement obligations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014 we had provided $306,000 and $229,000 in certificates of deposit, respectively, or letters of credit to benefit ADEQ for
	such anticipated closure costs. Water systems, unlike wastewater systems, do not require Aquifer Protection Permits or the associated Clean Closure Requirement obligation.

	While the Company reports its revenue, disaggregated by service type, on the face of its Statements of Operations,
	the Company does not manage the business based on any performance measure at the individual revenue stream level. The Company does not have any customers that contribute more than 10% to the Company&#146;s revenues or revenue streams. Additionally
	we note that the CODM uses consolidated financial information to evaluate the Company&#146;s performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates the Company&#146;s results and performance to the Board of Directors. It is upon this

	which change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and changing the disclosures for disposals that meet the definition under the new guidance. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a
	strategic shift in a company&#146;s strategy would be deemed a discontinued operation. To meet the definition of strategic shift, the disposal should have a major effect on the organization&#146;s operations and financial results. Certain examples
	of the type of disposals that would qualify as a discontinued operation include a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment. For those disposals that meet the criteria, expanded disclosures on
	assets, liabilities, income and expenses would apply. The Company&#146;s adoption of ASU 2014-08 in the first quarter of 2015 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

	nonfinancial assets not included within other FASB standards.&nbsp;The guiding principal of the new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for the
	delivery of goods and services.&nbsp;ASU 2014-09 may be adopted using either of two acceptable methods: (1) retrospective adoption to each prior period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (2) adoption with the
	cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain disclosures.&nbsp;To assess at which time revenue should be recognized, an entity should use the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2)
	identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance

	due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. The agreements are generally recorded as a lien against the land and must be assumed in the event of a sale or transfer. The regional planning and coordination

	Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2010, GWRI accounted for funds received under ICFAs as revenue once
	the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. As these arrangements are with developers and not with the end water or wastewater customer, the timing of revenue recognition coincided with the completion of GWRI&#146;s performance obligations under
	the agreement with the developer and with GWRI&#146;s ability to provide fitted capacity for water and wastewater service through its regulated subsidiaries.

	The 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision established new rates for the recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the utilities and a return on invested
	capital. In determining the new annual revenue requirement, the ACC imputed a reduction to rate base for all amounts related to ICFA funds collected by the Company that the ACC deemed to be CIAC for rate making purposes. As a result of the decision
	by the ACC, GWRI changed its accounting policy for the accounting of ICFA funds. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, GWRI recorded ICFA funds received as CIAC. Thereafter, the ICFA-related CIAC was amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over
	the estimated depreciable life of the utility plant at the related utilities. The balance of ICFA-related CIAC, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $64.1 million as of January&nbsp;1, 2014.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	With the issuance of Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364, in February 2014, the ACC changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for
	going forward. Most notably, ICFA funds would no longer be required to reduce future rates as a result of the ratemaking process. We have eliminated the CIAC liability that is no longer required and reversed the associated regulatory liability
	brought about by Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364 by recording a gain of $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. ICFA funds which were already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364 would be
	accounted for in accordance with the Company&#146;s ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision. For ICFA funds to be received in the future, Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364 prescribes that 70% of
	ICFA funds to be received by the Company will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a HUF liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, to be accounted for in accordance with the Company&#146;s ICFA revenue
	recognition policy.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company will account for the portion allocated to the HUF as a CIAC contribution. However, in accordance with the
	ACC directives the CIAC is not deducted from rate base until the HUF funds are expended for utility plant. Such funds will be segregated in a separate bank account and used for plant. A HUF liability will be established and will be amortized as a
	reduction of depreciation expense over the useful life of the related plant once the HUF funds are utilized for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a HUF or ICFA, the utilities must first use the HUF moneys received, after
	which, it may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The Company will record the 30% as deferred revenue, which is to be recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the ICFA are met. As of December&nbsp;31,
	2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, ICFA deferred revenue recorded on the consolidated balance sheet totaled $19.7 million, which represents deferred revenue recorded for ICFA funds received on contracts that had become due prior to Rate Decision
	No.&nbsp;74364. For ICFA contracts coming due after Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364, 30% will be added to this balance with the remaining 70% recorded to a HUF liability.

	Regulatory asset
</B>
	&#151;Under ASC Topic&nbsp;980, rate regulated entities defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory
	assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in income by an unregulated company. Certain costs
	associated with our rate cases have been deferred on our balance sheet as regulatory assets as approved by the ACC. At December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had one regulatory asset in the amount of $227,000 and$400,000,
	respectively, related to costs incurred in connection with our most recent rate case. This amount began to amortize in January 2015, and will amortize over a three-year period, which period is aligned with the phase-in of the new rates provided by
	Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364. In addition, there was a decrease of approximately $50,000 in the regulatory asset associated with the condemnation of Valencia.

	Intangible assets / Regulatory liability
</B>
	&#151;The Company had previously recorded
	certain intangible assets related to ICFA contracts obtained in connection with our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde and Sonoran Utility Services (&#147;Sonoran&#148;) acquisitions. The intangible assets represented the benefits to be received over time by
	virtue of having those contracts. Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2010, the ICFA-related intangibles were amortized when ICFA funds were recognized as revenue. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, in connection with the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, these
	assets became fully offset by a regulatory liability of $11.2 million since the imputation of ICFA funds as CIAC effectively resulted in the Company not being able to benefit (through rates) from the acquired ICFA contracts.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, the gross ICFAs intangibles began to be amortized when cash was received in proportion to the amount of total
	cash expected to be received under the underlying agreements. However, such amortization expense was offset by a corresponding reduction of the regulatory liability in the same amount.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364, the Company changed its policy around the ICFA related intangible assets. As discussed above,
	pursuant to Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364, approximately 70% of ICFA funds to be received in the future will be recorded as a HUF at the Company&#146;s applicable utility subsidiary. The remaining approximate 30% of future ICFA funds will be recorded
	at the parent company level and will be subject to the Company&#146;s ICFA revenue recognition accounting policy. Since the Company now expects to experience an economic benefit from the 30% portion of future ICFA funds, 30% of the regulatory
	liability, or $3.4 million, was reversed during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014. The remaining 70% of the regulatory liability, or $7.9 million, will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. At December&nbsp;31, 2015 and
	December&nbsp;31, 2014, this was the Company&#146;s sole regulatory liability.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Subsequent to Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364, the intangible
	assets will continue to amortize when the corresponding ICFA funds are received in proportion to the amount of total cash expected to be received under the underlying agreements. The recognition of amortization expense will be partially offset by a
	corresponding reduction of the regulatory liability.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	Income taxes
</B>
	&#151;As a result of the additional revenues expected to be
	provided by Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364, as well as other factors, the Company performed an evaluation of its deferred income taxes and determined that sufficient evidence now exists that the majority of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets
	will be utilized in the future. Accordingly in 2014, the Company reversed substantially all of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance previously recorded (see Note 11).

	On June&nbsp;5, 2013, the Company sold
	Global Water Management, LLC (&#147;GWM&#148;) to an investor group led by a private equity firm that specializes in the water industry. GWR was a wholly-owned subsidiary of GWRI that owned and operated the FATHOM business (&#147;FATHOM&#148;). In
	connection with the sale of GWM, the Company made an investment in the FATHOM Partnership. This limited partnership investment is accounted for under the equity method due to our investment being considered more than minor.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The original investment in FATHOM consisted of an investment of $750,000 in the Series A preferred units and $98,000 of common units.
	Additionally, GWRI invested $750,000 in a 10% convertible promissory note of GWM with an original maturity of December&nbsp;31, 2014. We accounted for this investment in accordance with relevant accounting guidance for debt and equity securities
	which requires the fair value measurement of the investment pursuant to ASC Topic 820,
<I>
	Fair Value Measurement
</I>
	. The fair value of the investment in the convertible notes at initial recognition was determined using the transaction price, of
	which the price paid by the Company was consistent with the price paid by third party investors for comparable convertible notes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	November 2014, FATHOM experienced a qualified financing event (qualified financing was defined as an equity financing by FATHOM Partnership in which FATHOM Partnership sells its units for at least $1.75 per unit and the aggregate proceeds from such
	financing was at least $15 million, exclusive of convertible note amounts converted). At the time of the qualified financing, the convertible promissory note was converted into Series B Preferred Units, and accounted for under the equity method. The
	Company&#146;s resulting ownership of common and preferred units represented an approximate 8.0% ownership (on a fully diluted basis).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	conjunction with the qualified financing, our equity interest in the Series A and Series B preferred shares was adjusted in accordance with ASC 323, wherein we recorded a gain of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The adjustment to the
	carrying value of our investments was calculated using our proportionate share of FATHOM&#146;s adjusted net equity. The gain was recorded within other income and expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The carrying value of our
	investment consisted of a balance of $821,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and $1.2 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, and reflects our initial investment, the adjustment related to the qualified financing and our proportionate share of
	FATHOM&#146;s cumulative losses.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We evaluate our investment in FATHOM Partnership/GWM for impairment whenever events or changes in
	circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an &#147;other-than-temporary&#148; decline in value. Since the sale of GWM, the losses incurred on the investment were greater than anticipated; however, based
	upon our evaluation of various relevant factors, including the recent equity event and the ability of FATHOM to achieve and sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of our investment, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 we do not
	believe the investment to be impaired.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have evaluated whether GWM qualifies as a variable interest entity (&#147;VIE&#148;) pursuant to
	the accounting guidance of ASC 810,
<I>
	Consolidations
</I>
	. Considering the potential that the total equity investment in FATHOM Partnership/GWM may not be sufficient to absorb the losses of FATHOM, we believe it is currently appropriate to view GWM
	as a VIE. However, considering GWRI&#146;s minority interest and limited involvement with the FATHOM business, the Company would not be required to consolidate the financial statements of GWM. Rather, we have accounted for our investment under the
	equity method.

	On January&nbsp;19, 2016, GWRC announced that it has
	agreed to pursue a proposed transaction with the Company that will result in, subject to the satisfaction of shareholder approval and certain other conditions, GWRC merging with and into the Company (the &#147;Proposed Transaction&#148;). The
	Proposed Transaction is part of the Company&#146;s overall plan to simplify its corporate structure by eliminating one level of holding company ownership, refinance its outstanding tax-exempt bonds on more favorable terms (as described below),
	improve liquidity for shareholders over the medium to long-term and have a single governing jurisdiction in the U.S., where all of the assets, operations and employees of the business are located. As a result of the merger, GWRC will cease to exist
	as a British Columbia corporation and the Company, governed by the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, will be the surviving entity. The Proposed Transaction is conditional upon the concurrent completion of a proposed initial public offering of
	shares of common stock of the Company in the United States (the &#147;U.S. IPO&#148;).&nbsp;The Company has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the U.S. IPO.

	GWRC was organized in 2010 and holds an approximate 47.8% interest in the Company. GWRC is not part
	of the consolidated Company. GWRC has no employees and GWRI provides for the ongoing management and general administration of all of GWRC&#146;s business affairs pursuant to a management agreement between GWRC and GWRI to provide such services.
	Accordingly, GWRC is economically dependent on the Company. Services provided by the Company under the management agreement are provided at no charge to GWRC, and are not monetarily significant. However, GWRC does incur certain costs not covered by
	the management agreement. These include GWRC&#146;s accounting fees, listing fees and other costs directly associated with operating as a publicly traded company. Whereas GWRC does not expect to generate cash flows from operating activities, the
	operating costs incurred by GWRC and other cash requirements are paid by the Company. Amounts paid by GWRI on GWRC&#146;s behalf during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014 totaled $1.4 million and $505,000,
	respectively. The Company accounts for such payments as equity distributions to GWRC.

	cash requirements, as needed. The residual balance of the cash advance is presented on the Company&#146;s balance sheet in due from related party. The related party balance will be reduced upon dividend declaration, when the amount declared is
	presented as a reduction in equity. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the balance of the advance was $188,000. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the balance of the advance was zero.

	long-term service agreement. Based on current service connections, we estimate that fees to be paid to GWM for FATHOM services will be $7.72 per water account/month, which is an annual rate of approximately $1.8 million. For the years ended

	The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for
	income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
	and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax
	assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company does not have any uncertain tax positions.

</B>
	On December&nbsp;30, 2010, we adopted a
	phantom stock unit plan authorizing the directors of the Company to issue phantom stock units (&#147;PSUs&#148;) to our employees. The value of the PSUs issued under the plan tracks the performance of GWRC&#146;s shares and gives rise to a right of
	the holder to receive a cash payment the value of which, on a particular date, will be the market value of the equivalent number of shares of GWRC at that date. The issuance of PSUs as a core component of employee compensation is intended to

	the right to receive a cash payment amounting to the difference between C$4.00 per share (the &#147;exercise price&#148;) and the closing price of GWRC&#146;s common shares on the exercise date, provided that the closing price was in excess of
	C$4.00 per share. In total, 152,091 SARs were issued to employees below the senior management level, and zero remain outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The SARs vested in equal installments over the four quarters of 2012 and expired four
	years after the date of issuance. Holders of SARs could exercise their awards once they vested. Individuals who voluntarily or involuntarily leave the Company forfeit their rights under the awards. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, $69,000,
	was paid to holders for these vested SARs. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, $9,000, was paid to holders for these vested SARs.

	against SNR and NWP (collectively the &#147;Respondents&#148;) in May 2011 in response to the non-payment of certain fees due from Respondents to GWRI for major permitting milestones achieved.
	SNR and NWP did not dispute that we achieved the permit milestones that trigger payment.&nbsp;The monies we contended GWRI was owed pursuant to the Agreements from the Respondents were in excess of $3.7 million of principal (not including interest
	and recovery of litigation costs, which we pursued during arbitration).&nbsp;Including interest and litigation costs, GWRI sought in excess of $6.0 million.&nbsp;In response, SNR and NWP filed counterclaims for amongst other things, breach of
	contract and rescission. The arbitration hearing concluded on March&nbsp;2, 2012 and the interim award was received on March&nbsp;28, 2012 indicating GWRI as the prevailing party in the arbitration. The final award was received April&nbsp;20,
	2012.&nbsp;According to the award, the arbitration panel found in the Company&#146;s favor on almost all claims, and ruled that the Company is entitled to approximately $4.2 million of ICFA fees, 15%&nbsp;per annum interest totaling $2.0 million and
	recovery of 1/3 of the legal costs incurred in connection with the litigation.&nbsp;In August 2012, we received the monies due from NWP totaling $2,044,000, consisting of $1,219,000 of past due ICFA fees, $719,000 of interest and $106,000 of
	reimbursed litigation costs.

	Subsequent to the award, SNR filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In July 2013, the Bankruptcy court ruled that
	SNR must cure their default in order to assume the ICFA, which would require full payment of past due ICFA fees, interest and reimbursement of legal costs by no later than March&nbsp;21, 2014, stating that such value would be determined by the court
	at a future date. In October 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with SNR wherein payment terms were set to serve as the basis of SNR&#146;s bankruptcy plan of reorganization. Under the plan and settlement agreement that was
	approved by the court, the Company would receive monies due from SNR totaling $5,321,000, consisting of $2,802,000 of past due ICFA fees, $2,021,000 of interest (recorded within
<I>
	other income (expense)
</I>
	in our statement of operations for the
	year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014) and $498,000 of reimbursed litigation costs, all of which was received during the first quarter of 2014. With respect to the $2,802,000 ICFA fees mentioned above, since such amount was due to the Company prior to
	January&nbsp;1, 2014, in accordance with Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364, we were not required to allocate any portion of the amount as a HUF.

	Separately, on March&nbsp;18, 2014, SNR and NWP filed an application for rehearing with the ACC regarding Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364. The
	application relates only to the particular issue of whether ICFA funds to be paid in the future will be subject to a Consumer Price Index (&#147;CPI&#148;) adjustment, which Rate Decision No.&nbsp;74364 approved. The ACC had twenty days from the
	date of the application to decide if a rehearing would be granted, but that period passed without such action, eliminating any opportunity for rehearing.

	attorneys&#146; fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

	Section&nbsp;102(b)(7) of the DGCL enables a corporation in its certificate of incorporation or an amendment thereto to eliminate or limit the

	personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL.
