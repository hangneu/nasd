	December 2013. The growth rate of our MAUs significantly decreased in 2015 primarily due to the reduced growth of number of smartphone users in China, and upgrades to our platform that take time for users to adapt to. Growing our user base and
	increasing the overall level of user engagement on our social networking platform are critical to our business. If our user growth rate continues to slows down, as it did in 2015, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to
	retain existing users and enhance user engagement on our platform. If our Momo mobile application is no longer one of the social networking tools that people frequently use, or if people do not perceive our services to be interesting or useful, we
	may not be able to attract users or increase the frequency or degree of their engagement. A number of user-oriented instant communication products that achieved early popularity have since seen the size of their user base or level of user engagement
	decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our user base or user engagement level in the future. A number of factors could negatively affect user retention, growth and engagement,

	Our monetization model is new and evolving. We began to generate revenues in the second half of 2013 primarily through membership
	subscriptions, but we continue to explore and implement new monetization models. We currently generate revenues through membership subscriptions, mobile marketing services, mobile games, and other services, which accounted for approximately 43.6%,
	29.0%, 23.2%, and 4.2%, respectively, of our net revenues in 2015. In 2015, we have continued to strategize to increase monetization of our platform. In January 2015, we launched gift mall services that allow users to send gifts to each other. In
	February 2015, we launched our first self-developed game on our platform and started to generate revenues by in-game purchases of virtual items. In the second quarter of 2015, we launched our in-feed marketing solutions powered by a proprietary
	self-serve advertising system, and started to offer brand-oriented display ads and action-driven ad products such as app downloads. In addition, in September 2015, we launched our live music and entertainment broadcasting service which adopts a
	virtual items-based revenue model. If our strategic initiatives do not enhance our ability to monetize our existing services or enable us to develop new approaches to monetization, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits
	or recover any associated costs. Furthermore, as the online music and entertainment industry in China is relatively young, there are few proven methods of projecting user demand or available industry standards on which we can rely.

	As we further expand, we will also seek to develop additional strategic partnerships with third parties, including e-commerce companies,
	online marketplaces and other content or service providers. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop, maintain or enhance beneficial strategic partnership at reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, we may in the future introduce new
	services to further diversify our revenue streams, including services with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. If these new or enhanced services fail to engage users, customers or platform partners, we may fail to
	attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenues to justify our investments, and our business and operating results may suffer as a result.

	Revenues generated from our mobile marketing
	services have increased significantly from 0.4% and 4.4% of our net revenues in 2013 and 2014, respectively, to 29.0% of our net revenues in 2015. Since we began to offer mobile marketing services in the third quarter of 2013, we have diversified
	and expanded our mobile marketing service offerings to increasingly monetize our platform. Currently our mobile marketing services primarily comprise brand-oriented display ads and in-feed marketing solutions. As is common in the industry, our
	marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. In addition, marketers may view some of our products as experimental and
	unproven. Marketers may not continue to do business with us, or they may advertise with us based on terms unfavorable to us, if we do not deliver our marketing solutions in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in
	advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. For example, failure to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users, or a decrease in user engagement may cause marketers to reduce or
	cease their spending on our mobile marketing services.

	In addition, expenditures by marketers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall

	Growing and retaining our user base and converting some of our users into paying users largely depend on our ability to continuously offer new games and game updates that anticipate and effectively respond to changing player interests and

	timetable for new game launches. A number of factors, including changing game player preferences and our relationship with existing and new third-party game developers, could affect the popularity of new games or delay the launch of new games on our

	Introducing new technologies into our systems involves numerous technical challenges, substantial amounts of capital and personnel resources
	and often takes many months to complete. For example, the market for mobile devices in China is highly fragmented, and the lower resolution, functionality, operating system compatibility and memory currently associated with the kaleidoscopic models
	of mobile devices in the Chinese marketplace may make the use of our services through these devices more difficult and impair the user experience. We intend to continue to devote resources to the development of additional technologies and services.
	We may not be able to effectively integrate new technologies on a timely basis or at all, which may decrease user satisfaction with our services. Such technologies, even if integrated, may not function as expected or may be unable to attract and
	retain a substantial number of mobile device users to use our Momo mobile application. We also may not be able to protect such technology from being copied by our competitors. Our failure to keep pace with rapid technological changes may cause us to
	fail to retain or attract users or generate revenues, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results.

	The Ministry of Commerce of the People&#146;s Republic of China, or MOFCOM, published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law
	in January 2015 aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the
	Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The draft Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line
	with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. While the Ministry of Commerce solicited comments on this draft earlier this year, substantial
	uncertainties exist with respect to its enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as proposed, may materially impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance

	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the definition of foreign
	investment and introduces the principle of &#147;actual control&#148; in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities established in China
	but &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors will be treated as FIEs, whereas an entity set up in a foreign jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the MOFCOM, treated as a PRC domestic investor provided that the entity
	is &#147;controlled&#148; by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection, &#147;control&#148; is broadly defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i)&nbsp;holding 50% of more of the voting rights of the subject
	entity; (ii)&nbsp;holding less than 50% of the voting rights of the subject entity but having the power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power to exert material
	influence on the board, the shareholders&#146; meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii)&nbsp;having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&#146;s operations,
	financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE, it will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in a &#147;negative list,&#148; to be separately issued by
	the State Council later, if the FIE is engaged in the industry listed in the negative list.&nbsp;Unless the underlying business of the FIE falls within the negative list, which calls for market entry clearance by the MOFCOM, prior approval from the
	government authorities as mandated by the existing foreign investment legal regime would no longer be required for establishment of the FIE.

	We face uncertainties regarding the reporting on and consequences of previous private equity financing transactions involving the transfer and
	exchange of shares in our company by non-resident investors. According to the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises issued by the PRC State Administration of Taxation on
	December&nbsp;10, 2009, with retroactive effect from January&nbsp;1, 2008, or SAT Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise indirectly through a disposition of equity interests in an
	overseas holding company (other than a purchase and sale of shares issued by a PRC resident enterprise in public securities market), or an Indirect Transfer, and such overseas holding company is located in a tax jurisdiction that: (a)&nbsp;has an
	effective tax rate less than 12.5% or (b)&nbsp;does not tax foreign income of its residents, the non-resident enterprise, as the seller, shall report such Indirect Transfer to the competent tax authority of the PRC resident enterprise within 30 days
	of execution of the equity transfer agreement for such Indirect Transfer. The PRC tax authority will examine the true nature of the Indirect Transfer, and if the tax authority considers that the foreign investor has adopted an abusive arrangement
	without reasonable commercial purposes and for the purpose of avoiding or reducing PRC tax, they will disregard the existence of the overseas holding company that is used for tax planning purposes and re-characterize the Indirect Transfer. As a
	result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC withholding tax at the rate of up to 10%. SAT Circular 698 also points out that when a non-resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its
	related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the competent tax authorities have the power to make a reasonable adjustment on the taxable income of the transaction.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On February&nbsp;3, 2015, the SAT issued a Public Notice [2015] No.&nbsp;7, or Public Notice 7, to supersede existing provisions in relation
	to the Indirect Transfer as set forth in Circular 698, while the other provisions of Circular 698 remain in force. Public Notice 7 introduces a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Public Notice extends its
	tax jurisdiction to capture not only Indirect Transfer as set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of immovable property in China and assets held under the establishment and place in China of a foreign company through
	the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. Public Notice 7 also addresses the transfer of the equity interest in a foreign intermediate holding company widely. In addition, Public Notice 7 provides clearer criteria than
	Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and introduces safe harbour scenarios applicable to internal group restructurings. However, it also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee of the Indirect Transfer
	as they have to make self-assessment on whether the transaction should be subject to PRC tax and to file or withhold the PRC tax accordingly.

	There are few guidances and practical experience as to the application of Circular 698 and Public Notice 7. Where non-resident investors were
	involved in our private equity financing, if such transactions were determined by the tax authorities to lack reasonable commercial purpose, we and our non-resident investors may become at risk of being taxed under Circular 698 and Public Notice 7
	and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 and Public Notice 7 or to establish that we should not be taxed under Circular 698 and Public Notice 7, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
	and results of operations or the non-resident investors&#146; investments in us.

	The Regulations on Mergers
	and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&amp;A Rules, and other recently adopted regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and
	acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. For example, the M&amp;A Rules require that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic
	enterprise, if (i)&nbsp;any important industry is concerned, (ii)&nbsp;such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic security, or (iii)&nbsp;such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise
	which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People&#146;s Congress on August&nbsp;30, 2007 and effective as of August&nbsp;1, 2008 requires that
	transactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds (i.e., during the previous fiscal year, (i)&nbsp;the total global turnover of all operators participating in the transaction exceeds RMB10 billion
	and at least two of these operators each had a turnover of more than RMB400 million within China, or (ii)&nbsp;the total turnover within China of all the operators participating in the concentration exceeded RMB2 billion, and at least two of these
	operators each had a turnover of more than RMB400 million within China) must be cleared by MOFCOM before they can be completed. In addition, on February&nbsp;3, 2011, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the
	Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the Circular 6, which officially established a security review system for mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors.
	Further, on August&nbsp;25, 2011, MOFCOM promulgated the Regulations on Implementation of Security Review System for the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the MOFCOM Security Review Regulations, which became
	effective on September&nbsp;1, 2011, to implement the Circular 6. Under Circular&nbsp;6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having &#147;national defense and security&#148; concerns and mergers and
	acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire the &#147;de facto control&#148; of domestic enterprises with &#147;national security&#148; concerns. Under the MOFCOM Security Review Regulations, MOFCOM will focus on the substance and actual
	impact of the transaction when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition is subject to security review. If MOFCOM decides that a specific merger or acquisition is subject to security review, it will submit it to the Inter-Ministerial Panel,
	an authority established under the Circular 6 led by the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, and MOFCOM under the leadership of the State Council, to carry out security review. The regulations prohibit foreign investors from
	bypassing the security review by structuring transactions through trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. There is no explicit provision or official interpretation stating that
	the merging or acquisition of a company engaged in the mobile games business requires security review, and there is no requirement that acquisitions completed prior to the promulgation of the Security Review Circular are subject to MOFCOM review.

	transactions. It is unclear whether our business would be deemed to be in an industry that raises &#147;national defense and security&#148; or &#147;national security&#148; concerns. However, MOFCOM or other government agencies may publish
	explanations in the future determining that our business is in an industry subject to the security review, in which case our future acquisitions in the PRC, including those by way of entering into contractual control arrangements with target

	On August&nbsp;29, 2008, SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of
	the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency registered capital into Renminbi by restricting how the
	converted Renminbi may be used. SAFE Circular 142 provides that Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable
	governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the Renminbi capital converted from the foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested
	company. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be altered without SAFE approval, and such Renminbi capital may not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of SAFE Circular 142 could
	result in severe monetary or other penalties. Furthermore, SAFE promulgated a circular on November&nbsp;9, 2010, known as Circular 59, which tightens the examination of the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from overseas offerings. SAFE
	further promulgated the Circular on Further Clarification and Regulation of the Issues Concerning the Administration of Certain Capital Account Foreign Exchange Businesses, or Circular 45, on November&nbsp;9, 2011, which expressly prohibits
	foreign-invested enterprises from using registered capital settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies to grant loans through entrustment arrangements with a bank, repay inter-company loans or repay bank loans that have been transferred to

	Starting in 2011, the Chinese affiliates of the &#147;big four&#148; accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting
	firm, were affected by a conflict between US and Chinese law. Specifically, for certain U.S. listed companies operating and audited in mainland China, the SEC and the PCAOB sought to obtain from the Chinese firms access to their audit work papers
	and related documents. The firms were, however, advised and directed that under China law they could not respond directly to the US regulators on those requests, and that requests by foreign regulators for access to such papers in China had to be
	channeled through the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC.

	In late 2012, this impasse led the SEC to commence administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e)
	of its Rules of Practice and also under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 against the Chinese accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm. A first instance trial of the proceedings in July 2013 in the SEC&#146;s
	internal administrative court resulted in an adverse judgment against the firms. The administrative law judge proposed penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice before the SEC, although that proposed penalty
	did not take effect pending review by the Commissioners of the SEC. On February&nbsp;6, 2015, before a review by the Commissioner had taken place, the firms reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the settlement, the SEC accepts that future
	requests by the SEC for the production of documents will normally be made to the CSRC. The firms will receive matching Section&nbsp;106 requests, and are required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such requests, which in
	substance require them to facilitate production via the CSRC. If they fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure. Remedies for
	any future noncompliance could include, as appropriate, an automatic six-month bar on a single firm&#146;s performance of certain audit work, commencement of a new proceeding against a firm, or in extreme cases the resumption of the current
	proceeding against all four firms.

	In the event that the SEC restarts the administrative proceedings, depending upon the final outcome,
	listed companies in the United States with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance
	with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about any such future proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty
	regarding China-based, United States-listed companies and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely affected.

	If our independent

	financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to the delisting of our ADSs from the NASDAQ Global Select Market or deregistration from the SEC,
	or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our ADSs in the United States.

	Under United States federal income
	tax law, we will be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year if either (i)&nbsp;75% or more of our gross income for the taxable year is passive income or (ii)&nbsp;50% or more of the value of our assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly
	average) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;asset test&#148;). Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat Beijing Momo as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of this entity but also because we are entitled to substantially all of its economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate its results of operations in our consolidated
	U.S. GAAP financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we are not the owner of Beijing Momo for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would likely be treated as a PFIC for the taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and would
	anticipate being a PFIC for future taxable years. Assuming that we are the owner of Beijing Momo for United States federal income tax purposes and based upon our income and assets and the value of our ADSs, we do not believe that we were a PFIC for

	However, because PFIC
	status is a factual determination made annually after the close of each taxable year on the basis of the composition of our income and assets, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for current the taxable year or any future taxable
	year. Fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test, including the value of our goodwill and unbooked
	intangibles, may be determined by reference to the market price of our ADSs from time to time (which may be volatile). In estimating the value of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account our current market
	capitalization. If our market capitalization subsequently declines, we may be or become classified as a PFIC for the current taxable year or future taxable years. In addition, the overall level of our passive assets will be affected by how, and how
	quickly, we spend our liquid assets. Under circumstances where our revenue from activities that produce passive income significantly increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce non-passive income, or where we determine not to
	deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC may substantially increase. Furthermore, because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules, it is possible that the IRS may
	challenge our classification of certain income or assets as non-passive, or our valuation of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, each of which may result in our company becoming classified as a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable
	years.

	The M&amp;A Rules, which were adopted in
	2006 by six PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, purport to require offshore special purpose vehicles that are controlled by PRC companies or individuals and that have been formed for the purpose of seeking a public listing on an overseas
	stock exchange through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies or assets to obtain CSRC approval prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. The interpretation and application of the regulations remain unclear, and our

	approval for our initial public offering would subject us to sanctions imposed by the CSRC and other PRC regulatory agencies, which could include fines and penalties on our operations in China, restrictions or limitations on our ability to pay

	Our PRC counsel, Han Kun Law Offices, has advised us that, based on its understanding of the
	current PRC laws and regulations, we are not required to submit an application to the CSRC for the approval of the listing and trading of our ADSs on the NASDAQ Global Select Market because (i)&nbsp;the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive
	rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings like our initial public offering are subject to this regulation, and (ii)&nbsp;our wholly owned PRC subsidiary was established by foreign direct investment, rather than through a merger or
	acquisition of a domestic company as defined under the M&amp;A Rules. However, we cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as our PRC counsel, and hence we may face regulatory
	actions or other sanctions from the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in China, limit our operating privileges in China, delay or restrict the repatriation of the
	proceeds from our initial public offering into China or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of the ADSs. In addition, if
	the CSRC or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for our initial public offering, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of such approval requirements, if and when procedures are
	established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the ADSs.

	at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. Our dual-class voting structure gives disproportionate voting power to the Class&nbsp;B
	ordinary shares held by Gallant Future Holdings Limited, a company 100% beneficially owned by Yan Tang, our co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. Mr.&nbsp;Tang beneficially owned 77.2% of the aggregate voting power of our company as of

	fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent

	our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws
	than the United States. Some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder

	from registration. The depositary may also determine that it is not feasible to distribute certain property through the mail. Additionally, the value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of mailing them. In these cases, the depositary
	may determine not to distribute such property. We have no obligation to register under U.S. securities laws any ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or other securities received through such distributions. We also have no obligation to take any other
	action to permit the distribution of ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to holders of ADSs. This means that you may not receive distributions we make on our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or
	impractical for us to make them available to you. These restrictions may cause a material decline in the value of our ADSs.

	The Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in and Operation of Value-added Telecommunications Business,

	an internet content provider, or ICP, license to conduct any value-added telecommunications business in China. Under the Circular, a domestic company that holds an ICP license is prohibited from leasing, transferring or selling the license to
	foreign investors in any form, and from providing any assistance, including providing resources, sites or facilities, to foreign investors that conduct value-added telecommunications business illegally in China. Furthermore, certain relevant assets,
	such as the relevant trademarks and domain names that are used in the value-added telecommunications business must be owned by the local ICP license holder or its shareholders. The Circular further requires each ICP license holder to have the
	necessary facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunications service providers are required to maintain network and information
	security in accordance with the standards set forth under the relevant PRC regulations. If an ICP license holder fails to comply with the requirements in the Circular and also fails to remedy such non-compliance within a specified period of time,
	the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology or its local counterparts have the discretion to take administrative measures against such license holder, including revoking its ICP license. Beijing Momo, the operator of our website, owns the

	In September 2000, the State Council issued the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or the Internet Measures, to regulate
	the provision of information services to online users through the internet. According to the Internet Measures, internet information services are divided into two categories: services of an operative nature and services of a non-operative nature.
	Our business conducted through our immomo.com website involves operating internet information services, which requires us to obtain an ICP license. If an internet information service provider fails to obtain an ICP license, the relevant local branch
	of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology may levy fines, confiscate its income or even block its website. When the ICP service involves areas of news, publication, education, medical treatment, health, pharmaceuticals and medical
	equipment, and if required by law or relevant regulations, specific approval from the respective regulatory authorities must be obtained prior to applying for the ICP license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology or its provincial
	level counterpart. Our affiliated PRC entity, Beijing Momo, currently holds an ICP license issued by Beijing Communications Administration, a local branch of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Our ICP license will expire in
	February 2017 and we plan to renew such license prior to its expiration date.

	As an internet content provider, we are subject to regulations relating to protection of privacy. In recent years, PRC government authorities
	have enacted laws and regulations on internet use to protect personal information from any unauthorized disclosure. The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services prohibit ICP service operators from insulting or slandering a third

	service operator may not collect any user personal information or provide such information to third parties without the consent of a user. An ICP service operator must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose for the collection

	likely leak of the user personal information, the ICP service operator must take immediate remedial measures and, in severe circumstances, to make an immediate report to the telecommunications regulatory authority. In addition, pursuant to the

	issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in July 2013, any collection and use of user personal information must be subject to the consent of the user, abide by the principles of legality, rationality and necessity and be within

	Tax Law and its implementation regulations, dividends generated from the business of a PRC subsidiary after January&nbsp;1, 2008 and payable to its foreign investor may be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% if the PRC tax authorities determine

	Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, an enterprise established outside China with &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; within
	China is considered a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation in
	April 2009 regarding the standards used to classify certain Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese enterprise groups and established outside of China as &#147;resident enterprises&#148; clarified that dividends and
	other income paid by such PRC &#147;resident enterprises&#148; will be considered PRC-source income and subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10%, when paid to non-PRC enterprise shareholders. This circular also subjects such PRC
	&#147;resident enterprises&#148; to various reporting requirements with the PRC tax authorities. Under the implementation regulations to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a &#147;de facto management body&#148; is defined as a body that has material
	and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the tax circular mentioned above specifies that certain PRC-invested overseas
	enterprises controlled by a Chinese enterprise or a Chinese enterprise group in the PRC will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or resided in the PRC: senior management personnel and departments that are
	responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and personnel decision making bodies; key properties, accounting books, the company seal, and minutes of board meetings and shareholders&#146; meetings; and half or more of the

	Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special
	Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise is reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10% if the
	Hong Kong enterprise directly holds at least 25% of the PRC enterprise. Pursuant to the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on the Issues concerning the Application of the Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements, or Circular 81, a Hong Kong
	resident enterprise must meet the following conditions, among others, in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax: (i)&nbsp;it must be a company; (ii)&nbsp;it must directly own the required percentage of equity interests and voting rights in the
	PRC resident enterprise; and (iii)&nbsp;it must have directly owned such required percentage in the PRC resident enterprise throughout the 12 months prior to receiving the dividends. Furthermore, the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident
	Enterprises to Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties (For Trial Implementation), which became effective in October 2009, require that non-resident enterprises must obtain approval from the relevant tax authority in order to enjoy the reduced
	withholding tax rate. There are also other conditions for enjoying the reduced withholding tax rate according to other relevant tax rules and regulations. Accordingly, Momo Technology HK Company Limited may be able to benefit from the 5% withholding
	tax rate for the dividends it receives from Beijing Momo, if it satisfies the conditions prescribed under Circular 81 and other relevant tax rules and regulations, and obtain the approvals as required. However, according to Circular 81, if the
	relevant tax authorities consider the transactions or arrangements we have are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future.

	In January 2009, the SAT promulgated the Provisional Measures for the Administration of
	Withholding of Enterprise Income Tax for Non-resident Enterprises, or the Non-resident Enterprises Measures, pursuant to which entities that have direct obligation to make certain payments to a non-resident enterprise shall be the relevant tax
	withholders for such non-resident enterprise. Further, the Non-resident Enterprises Measures provides that, in case of an equity transfer between two non-resident enterprises which occurs outside China, the non-resident enterprise which receives the
	equity transfer payment shall, by itself or engage an agent to, file tax declaration with the PRC tax authority located at place of the PRC company whose equity has been transferred, and the PRC company whose equity has been transferred shall assist

	In August 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, jointly adopted the Provisions
	Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&amp;A Rule, which became effective in September 2006. This M&amp;A Rule purports to require, among other things, offshore SPVs, formed for listing purposes
	through acquisition of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. We believe that CSRC approval is not required
	in the context of our initial public offering as we are not a special purpose vehicle formed for listing purpose through acquisition of domestic companies that are controlled by our PRC individual shareholders, as we acquired contractual control
	rather than equity interests in our domestic affiliated entities.

	authorities will promulgate any interpretation or implementing rules before our listing that would require CSRC or other governmental approvals for our initial public offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In
	such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our initial public offering into the PRC, or take

	or who are non-PRC citizens residing in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas
	listed company, and complete certain other procedures. Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our wholly foreign-owned
	subsidiaries in China and limit these subsidiaries&#146; ability to distribute dividends to us.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, the State Administration for
	Taxation has issued certain circulars concerning employee share options or restricted shares. Under these circulars, the employees working in the PRC who exercise share options or are granted restricted shares will be subject to PRC individual
	income tax. The PRC subsidiaries of such overseas listed company have obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who
	exercise their share options. If the employees fail to pay or the PRC subsidiaries fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other PRC
	government authorities. These registrations and filings are a matter of foreign exchange control and tax procedure and the grant of share incentive awards to employees is not subject to the government&#146;s discretionary approval. Compliance with
	PRC regulations on employee incentive plans has not had, and we believe will not in the future have, any material adverse effect on the implementation of our 2012 Plan and 2014 Plan.

	active user growth that may affect our costs and expenses and results of operations. We have experienced rapid user growth since our inception, although such rate of growth slowed significantly in 2015. Currently, membership subscription fees are
	the largest component of our revenues. The growth of our member base is driven primarily by the growth of the number of active users and our ability to convert a greater portion of our users into members.

	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2012, the PRC Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation
	launched a Business Tax to Value-Added Tax Transformation Pilot Program, or the VAT Pilot Program, which imposes VAT in lieu of business tax for certain &#147;modern service industries&#148; in certain regions and eventually expands to nation-wide
	in 2013. According to the implementation circulars released by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on the VAT Pilot Program, the &#147;modern service industries&#148; include research, development and technology
	services, information technology services, cultural innovation services, logistics support, lease of corporeal properties, attestation and consulting services. All of our entities were subject to the VAT Pilot Program as of December 31, 2015, or
	specifically, VAT at rate of 6% in lieu of business tax. With the adoption of the VAT Pilot Program, our revenues are subject to VAT payable on goods sold or taxable services provided by a general VAT taxpayer for a taxable period, which is the net
	balance of the output VAT for the period after crediting the input VAT for the period. Hence, the amount of VAT payable does not result directly from output VAT generated from goods sold or taxable services provided. Therefore, we have adopted the

	self-developed mobile game. Mobile games revenues generated by third-party game developers are presented net of revenue sharing with game developers, commission fees made to third-party application stores and other payment channels, surcharges and
	taxes. Mobile games revenues derived from self-developed game are recorded on a gross basis. Net revenues increased significantly from US$44.8 million in 2014 to US$134.0 million in 2015, primarily due to a significant increase in net revenues from
	membership subscription, mobile marketing services and mobile games. Net revenues increased significantly from US$3.1 million in 2013 to US$44.8 million in 2014, primarily due to a significant increase in net revenues from membership subscription

	mobile game platform for mobile games developed by third-party game developers, and we share user payments with such game developers. Game developers may offer their games on other platforms in addition to ours. For exclusive licensed mobile game
	services, we offer our mobile game platform for mobile games developed by third-party game developers, and our platform is the only one through which players can access such games. In addition to licensed mobile games, we also operate self-developed
	mobile games on our mobile game platform. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we operated 22 non-exclusive licensed games, seven exclusive licensed games and one self-developed game. We expect the number of games operated on our platform to increase in
	the future. Our revenues from mobile games depend on the number of paying users, which ultimately is determined by our ability to select and offer engaging games tailored to our platform and our user profiles.

	Users and customers can make payments for such services through third-party online and mobile phone payment channels. These third-party payment channels typically charge a handling fee for their services. Depreciation mainly consists of depreciation
	cost on our servers, computers and other equipment. SMS costs consist of fees that we pay to telecommunication carriers for text message services provided to our users for verification purpose. Labor costs consist of salaries and benefits, including
	share-based compensation expenses, for our employees involved in the operation of our platform. Service fees mainly consist of service costs related to our live music and entertainment broadcasting services. We expect our cost of revenues to

	. Our cost of revenues increased 92.3% from US$15.8 million in 2014 to US$30.3

	In February 2015, we launched the first self-developed game on our platform and started to generate revenues by in-game sales of virtual item.
	We have determined that we have an implied obligation to the players who purchased the virtual items to gain an enhanced game-playing experience over the average playing period of the paying players, and accordingly, we recognize the revenues
	ratably over the estimated period of player relationship starting from the point in time when the players purchase the virtual items and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The estimated period of player relationship of our only
	self-developed game is 56 days for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. We recognize revenue derived from our self-developed mobile games on a gross basis as we act as a principal to fulfill all obligations related to the mobile game operation.
	Commission fees paid to third-party application stores and other payment channels are recorded as cost of revenues.

	Based on the advice of Han Kun Law Offices, our PRC legal counsel, we believe above contractual

	More specifically, through these contractual agreements, we
	believe that the nominee shareholders of Beijing Momo do not have the direct or indirect ability to make decisions regarding the activities of Beijing Momo that could have a significant impact on the economic performance of Beijing Momo because all
	of the voting rights of Beijing Momo&#146;s nominee shareholders have been contractually transferred to Beijing Momo. Therefore, we have effective control over Beijing Momo. In addition, we believe that our ability to exercise effective control,
	together with the exclusive cooperation agreements, as supplemented, exclusive call option agreement and equity interest pledge agreement, give us the rights to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from Beijing Momo. Hence, we believe
	that the nominee shareholders of Beijing Momo do not have the rights to receive the expected residual returns of Beijing Momo, as such rights have been transferred to Beijing Momo. We evaluated the rights we obtained through entering into these
	contractual agreements and concluded we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect Beijing Momo&#146;s economic performance and also have the rights to receive the economic benefits of Beijing Momo that could be
	significant to Beijing Momo.

	In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we
	operate. We estimate our actual tax exposure and assess temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we include in our
	consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that we will recover our deferred tax assets from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a
	valuation allowance or increase this allowance, we must include an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations.

	Management must exercise significant judgment to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any

	actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.

	U.S. GAAP requires that an entity recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return at the largest amount that
	is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. If we ultimately determine that payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during that period.
	Conversely, we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than the expected ultimate assessment. We did not recognize any significant unrecognized tax benefits during the periods presented
	in this annual report.

	In determining the fair value of our equity interest in 2012, 2013 and 2014 prior to the completion of our initial public offering, we used
	both the market approach, also known as backsolve method, and the income approach, also known as the discounted cash flow method.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	backsolve method takes into consideration of the rights and preferences of each class of equity and solves for the total equity value that is comparable with a recent transaction in our own securities, considering the rights and preferences of each
	class of equity. The method was used when we completed financing transactions with investors on arm&#146;s length basis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The discounted
	cash flow, or DCF method, incorporates the projected cash flow of our management&#146;s best estimation as of each measurement date. The projected cash flow estimation includes, among others, analysis of projected revenue growth, gross margins and
	terminal value. The assumptions used in deriving the fair value of ordinary shares are consistent with our business plan.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The DCF method
	of the income approach involves applying appropriate discount rates to discount the future cash flows forecast to present value. In determining an appropriate discount rate, we have considered (i)&nbsp;the weighted-average cost of capital, or WACC
	and (ii)&nbsp;the rate of return expected by venture capitalists, or VCR.

	Weighted Average Cost of Capital
</I>
	. We calculated the cost
	of equity of the business as of the valuation dates using the capital asset pricing model, or CAPM, the most commonly adopted method for estimating the required rate of return for equity. Under CAPM, the cost of equity is determined with
	consideration of, the risk-free rate, systematic risk, equity market premium, size of our company, the scale of our business and our ability in achieving forecasted projections. In deriving the WACCs, certain publicly traded companies involving
	social network were selected for reference as our guideline companies. To reflect the operating environment in China and the general sentiment in the U.S. capital markets towards the social network, the guideline companies were selected with
	consideration of the following factors: (i)&nbsp;the guideline companies should provide similar services, and (ii)&nbsp;the guideline companies should either have their principal operations in Asia Pacific region, as we operate in China, and/or are
	publicly listed companies in the United States as we planned to list our shares in the United States.

	. According to guidance prescribed by the AICPA Audit and Accounting Practice Aid,
	&#147;Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation,&#148; because private enterprises often seek financing from private equity investors, including venture capital firms, the venture capital arena provides an
	observable market for the cost of capital for privately held enterprises. The expected return from venture capitalists for investing in our company when we were in expansion stage ranges from 35% to 50%. As we progress through early stage of
	development towards our initial public offering, the expected return from venture capitalists for investing in our company gradually declines when we were in bridge and IPO stage, which generally range from 25% to 35%.

	Since our capital structure comprised convertible preferred shares and ordinary shares at each grant date, we used the option-pricing method
	to allocate equity value of our company to preferred and ordinary shares, taking into account the guidance prescribed by the Practice Aid. This method involves making estimates of the anticipated timing of a potential liquidity event, such as a sale
	of our company or an initial public offering, and estimates of the volatility of our equity securities. The anticipated timing is based on the plans of our board and management. Estimating the volatility of the share price of a privately held
	company is complex because there is no readily available market for the shares. We estimated the volatility of our shares based on historical volatility of guideline companies&#146; shares. Had we used different estimates of volatility, the
	allocations between preferred and ordinary shares would have been different.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also applied a discount for lack of marketability, or
	DLOM, ranging from 33.5% to 5.0%, to reflect the fact that there is no ready market for shares in a closely-held company like us. When determining the DLOM, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. Under this option-pricing method, the cost
	of the put option, which can hedge the price change before the privately held shares can be sold, was considered as a basis to determine the discount for lack of marketability. This option pricing method was used because it takes into account
	certain company-specific factors, including the timing of our initial public offering and the volatility of the share price of the guideline companies engaged in the same industry.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we
	have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of preferred shares in private placements and net cash provided by operating activities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2014 and 2015, we had US$55.4 million, US$451.0 million and
	US$169.5 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments, which are unrestricted from withdrawal or use, or which have original maturities of three
	months or less when purchased. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next 12
	months. We may, however, need additional capital in the future to fund our continued operations.

	In the future, we may rely significantly on dividends and other distributions paid by our PRC
	subsidiary for our cash and financing requirements. There may be restrictions on the dividends and other distributions by our PRC subsidiary. The PRC tax authorities may require us to adjust our taxable income under the contractual arrangements that
	our PRC subsidiary currently has in place with our consolidated affiliated entity in a way that could materially and adversely affect the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends and make other distributions to us. In addition, under PRC laws
	and regulations, our PRC subsidiary may pay dividends only out of its accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC subsidiary is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated
	after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its respective registered capital. At its discretion, our PRC subsidiary may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits
	based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. The reserve fund and the staff welfare and bonus funds cannot be distributed as cash dividends. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our
	Corporate Structure&#151;We may rely on dividends paid by our PRC subsidiary to fund cash and financing requirements. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
	conduct our business and to pay dividends to holders of the ADSs and our ordinary shares.&#148; Furthermore, our investments made as registered capital and additional paid-in capital of our PRC subsidiary, consolidated affiliated entity and its
	subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on their distribution and transfer according to PRC laws and regulations.

	As a result, our
	PRC subsidiary, consolidated affiliated entity and its subsidiaries in China are restricted in their ability to transfer their net assets to us in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the amount of the
	restricted net assets, which represents registered capital and additional paid-in capital cumulative appropriations made to statutory reserves, was US$91.0 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we held cash and cash equivalents of US$82.4 million
	in aggregate outside of the PRC and US$87.1 million in aggregate in the PRC, of which US$75.8 million was denominated in RMB and US$11.3 million was in U.S.&nbsp;dollars. Of such cash and cash equivalents held in the PRC, our PRC subsidiary held
	cash and cash equivalents in the amount of US$11.3 million and RMB98.7 million (US$15.3 million), and our consolidated affiliated entity and its subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents in the amount of RMB392.1 million (US$60.5 million).

	As an offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding from the proceeds of our offshore fund
	raising activities to our PRC subsidiary only through loans or capital contributions, and to our consolidated affiliated entity and its subsidiaries only through loans, in each case subject to the satisfaction of the applicable government
	registration and approval requirements. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#151;PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and
	governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent us from using offshore funds to make loans to our PRC subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entity and its subsidiaries, or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC
	subsidiary.&#148; As a result, there is uncertainty with respect to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our PRC subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entity when needed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our PRC subsidiary may use its
	own retained earnings (rather than RMB converted from foreign currency denominated capital) to provide financial support to our consolidated affiliated entity either through entrustment loans from our PRC subsidiary to our consolidated affiliated
	entity or direct loans to such consolidated affiliated entity&#146;s nominee shareholders, which would be contributed to the consolidated variable entity as capital injections. Such direct loans to the nominee shareholders would be eliminated in our
	consolidated financial statements against the consolidated affiliated entity&#146;s share capital.

	Our full-time employees in the PRC
	participate in a government-mandated contribution plan pursuant to which certain pension benefits, medical care, unemployment insurance, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to such employees. We accrue for these benefits
	based on certain percentages of the employees&#146; salaries. The total provisions for such employee benefits were US$1.0 million, US$2.6&nbsp;million and US$6.5 million in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We expect our contribution towards such
	employee benefits to increase in the future as we continue to expand our workforce and as salary levels of our employees continue to increase.

	Our company is
	a holding company with no material operations of its own. We conduct our operations primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entity and its subsidiaries in China. As a result, our ability to pay dividends
	depends upon dividends paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries. If our wholly owned subsidiaries or any newly formed subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay
	dividends to us. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, each of our
	wholly owned PRC subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entity is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Although the
	statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the
	event of liquidation. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, the capital and statutory reserves restricted which represented the amount of net assets of our relevant subsidiaries in PRC not available for distribution were US$91.0 million as
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	We adopted the 2014 share incentive plan, or the 2014 Plan, in November 2014. The maximum aggregate number of shares which may be issued
	pursuant to all awards under the 2014 Plan is initially 14,031,194 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. Beginning in 2017, the number of shares reserved for future issuances under the 2014 Plan will be increased by a number equal to 1.5% of the total
	number of outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar year, or such lesser number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares as determined by our board of directors, on the first day of each calendar year during the term of the
	2014 Plan. As of March&nbsp;31, 2016, we have granted options to purchase 10,417,782 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and 40,001 restricted share units under our 2014 Plan, of which options to purchase an aggregate of 9,819,232 Class A ordinary shares
	remained outstanding and all restricted share units had vested. The following paragraphs summarize the terms of the 2014 Plan.

	Under Cayman Islands law, our directors have a fiduciary duty to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to our best interests. Our

	knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. In fulfilling their duty of
	care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, and the class rights vested thereunder in the holders of the shares. Our company has the right to seek

	Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These
	rules generally provide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of securities, or to dispose or direct the disposition of securities or has the right to acquire such
	powers within 60 days. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we have included shares that the person has the right to acquire within 60 days, including through the exercise of
	any option, warrant or other right or the conversion of any other security, in both the numerator and the denominator. These shares, however, are not included in the computation of the percentage ownership of any other person.

	Other than a civil complaint in China, we are currently not a party to any material legal or administrative proceedings. On October&nbsp;22,
	2015, we were served a civil complaint by Guangzhou Tian He People&#146;s Court in which the plaintiff claimed that Xiaoyao Xiyou, a game that we operated and currently operate, infringed upon the plaintiff&#146;s copyright in works of literature
	and art of a game, constituting unfair competition. The plaintiff demanded that we cease the infringement and pay compensation and legal costs totalling approximately RMB10 million (US$1.5 million). Previously, on December&nbsp;25, 2014,&nbsp;in the
	Beijing Intellectual Property Court&nbsp;located in Beijing, China, in which the plaintiff claimed that our use of the Chinese characters &#147;

	Our board of directors has discretion on whether to distribute dividends, subject to our memorandum and articles of association and
	certain restrictions under Cayman Islands law, namely that our company may only pay dividends out of profits or share premium, and provided always that it is able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. In addition, our
	shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare a dividend, but no dividend may exceed the amount recommended by our directors. Even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future
	operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.

	April 2014, of which US$58.0 million was paid. The special dividend was paid out of our share premium. We do not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most, if

	On April&nbsp;22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, issued the Notice
	Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprise on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or SAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the
	&#147;de facto management body&#148; of a PRC controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Further to SAT Circular 82, on July&nbsp;27, 2011, the SAT issued the Administrative Measures for Enterprise Income Tax of
	Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises (Trial), or SAT Bulletin 45, to provide more guidance on the implementation of SAT Circular 82; the bulletin became effective on September&nbsp;1, 2011. SAT Bulletin 45 clarified certain
	issues in the areas of resident status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities procedures. According to SAT Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise
	group will be considered as a PRC tax resident enterprise by virtue of having its &#147;de facto management body&#148; in China only if all of the following conditions are met: (a)&nbsp;the senior management and core management departments in charge
	of its daily operations function have their presence mainly in the PRC; (b)&nbsp;its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (c)&nbsp;its major assets, accounting books,
	company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&#146; meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (d)&nbsp;more than half of the enterprise&#146;s directors or senior management with voting rights habitually reside in the PRC.
	Although SAT Circular 82 and SAT Bulletin 45 only apply to offshore incorporated enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups and not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determination criteria set forth
	therein may reflect the SAT&#146;s general position on how the term &#147;de facto management body&#148; could be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises,
	individuals or foreigners.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We do not believe Momo Inc. meets all of the criteria described above. We believe that none of Momo Inc. and
	its subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC tax resident enterprise, because none of them is controlled by a PRC enterprise or PRC enterprise group, and because their records (including the resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of
	shareholders) are maintained outside the PRC. However, as the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term &#147;de facto
	management body&#148; when applied to our offshore entities, we may be considered as a resident enterprise and may therefore be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at 25% on our global income. In addition, if the PRC tax authorities determine that
	our company is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, dividends paid by us to non-PRC holders may be subject to PRC withholding tax, and gains realized on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares may be
	subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such dividends or gains are deemed to be from PRC sources.
	Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in the ADSs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If we are considered a &#147;non-resident enterprise&#148; by the PRC
	tax authorities, the dividends paid to us by our PRC subsidiaries will be subject to a 10% withholding tax. The EIT Law also imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by an foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding
	company outside of China, if such immediate holding company is considered as a non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place within China or if the received dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate
	holding company within China, unless such immediate holding company&#146;s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. The Cayman Islands, where our Company is incorporated does
	not have such tax treaty with China. Our US subsidiary is not an immediate holding company of any of our PRC subsidiaries. Under the Arrangement Between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and
	Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, the dividend withholding tax rate may be reduced to 5%, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise that receives a dividend is considered a non-PRC tax resident enterprise and holds
	at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong resident enterprise is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends
	under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividends may remain subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%. Accordingly, Momo Technology HK Company Limited may be able to enjoy the 5% withholding tax rate for the dividends it receives from its PRC
	subsidiaries if it satisfies the relevant conditions under tax rules and regulations, and obtains the approvals as required.

	According to
	the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises issued by the PRC State Administration of Taxation on December&nbsp;10, 2009, with retroactive effect from January&nbsp;1, 2008,
	or SAT Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise indirectly through a disposition of equity interests in an overseas holding company (other than a purchase and sale of shares issued by
	a PRC resident enterprise in public securities market), or an Indirect Transfer, and such overseas holding company is located in a tax jurisdiction that: (a)&nbsp;has an effective tax rate less than 12.5% or (b)&nbsp;does not tax foreign income of
	its residents, the non-resident enterprise, as the seller, shall report such Indirect Transfer to the competent tax authority of the PRC resident enterprise within 30 days of execution of the equity transfer agreement for such Indirect Transfer. The
	PRC tax authority will examine the true nature of the Indirect Transfer, and if the tax authority considers that the foreign investor has adopted an abusive arrangement without reasonable commercial purposes and for the purpose of avoiding or
	reducing PRC tax, they will disregard the existence of the overseas holding company that is used for tax planning purposes and re-characterize the Indirect Transfer. As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC
	withholding tax at the rate of up to 10%. SAT Circular 698 also points out that when a non-resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the
	competent tax authorities have the power to make a reasonable adjustment on the taxable income of the transaction.

	On February&nbsp;3, 2015, the SAT issued a Public Notice [2015] No.&nbsp;7, or Public Notice 7,
	to supersede existing provisions in relation to the Indirect Transfer as set forth in Circular 698, while the other provisions of Circular 698 remain in force. Public Notice 7 introduces a new tax regime that is significantly different from that
	under Circular 698. Public Notice extends its tax jurisdiction to capture not only Indirect Transfer as set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of immovable property in China and assets held under the establishment and
	place in China of a foreign company through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. Public Notice 7 also addresses transfer of the equity interest in a foreign intermediate holding company widely. In addition, Public Notice
	7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and introduces safe harbour scenarios applicable to internal group restructurings. However, it also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and
	transferee of the Indirect Transfer as they have to make self-assessment on whether the transaction should be subject to PRC tax and to file or withhold the PRC tax accordingly.

	There are few guidances and practical experience as to the application of Circular 698 and Public Notice 7. Where non-resident investors were
	involved in our private equity financing, if such transactions were determined by the tax authorities to lack reasonable commercial purpose, we and our non-resident investors may become at risk of being taxed under Circular 698 and Public Notice 7
	and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 and Public Notice 7 or to establish that we should not be taxed under Circular 698 and Public Notice 7, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

	The PRC tax authorities have the discretion under SAT

	that may involve complex corporate structures. If we are considered a non-resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and if the PRC tax authorities make adjustments to the taxable income of the transactions under SAT Circular 59,

	United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The following discussion is a summary of United States federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition of our ADSs
	or ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) that holds our ADSs or ordinary shares as &#147;capital assets&#148; (generally, property held for investment) under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code.
	This discussion is based upon existing United States federal tax law, which is subject to differing interpretations or change, possibly with retroactive effect. No ruling has been sought from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, with respect to
	any United States federal income tax consequences described below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. This discussion does not discuss all aspects of United States federal income taxation that
	may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules&nbsp;that may differ significantly from those discussed below (including for example, financial
	institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations), holders who are
	not U.S. Holders, holders who own (directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or more of our voting stock, holders who acquire their ADSs or ordinary shares pursuant to any employee share option or otherwise as compensation, investors that will
	hold their ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, or investors that have a functional currency other than the United States
	dollar). This discussion, moreover, does not address the United States federal estate, gift, Medicare or alternative minimum tax, or any non-United States, state, or local tax considerations of the ownership and disposition of our ADSs or ordinary
	shares. Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local, non-United States income, and other tax considerations of an investment in our ADSs or ordinary shares.

	For purposes of this discussion, a &#147;U.S. Holder&#148; is a beneficial owner of our ADSs or ordinary shares that is, for United States
	federal income tax purposes, (i)&nbsp;an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii)&nbsp;a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created in, or organized under

	Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A non-United States corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a &#147;passive foreign investment company,&#148; or PFIC, for
	United States federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, if either (i)&nbsp;75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of &#147;passive&#148; income or (ii)&nbsp;50% or more of the value of its assets (determined
	on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;asset test&#148;). For this purpose, cash and assets readily convertible into cash are
	categorized as passive assets, and the company&#146;s goodwill and other unbooked intangibles associated with our active business are taken into account as nonpassive assets. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends,
	interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or
	indirectly, more than 25% (by value) of the stock.

	Although the law in this regard is not entirely clear, we treat Beijing Momo as being
	owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes, because we control its management decisions and we are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with this entity, and, as a result, we consolidate the results of its
	operations in our consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we do not own the stock of Beijing Momo for United States federal income tax purposes, we would likely be treated as a PFIC for the taxable year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and would anticipate being a PFIC for future taxable years. Assuming that we are the owner of Beijing Momo for United States federal income tax purposes and based upon our income and assets and the value of our ADSs, we
	do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While we do not anticipate being a PFIC in the current taxable year or the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance in this regard
	because the determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC is a factual determination made annually that will depend, in part, upon the composition of our income and assets. Fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a
	PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test, including the value of our goodwill and unbooked intangibles, may be determined by reference to the market price of our ADSs from time
	to time (which may be volatile). In estimating the value of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account our current market capitalization. If our market capitalization subsequently declines, we may be or become classified
	as a PFIC for the current taxable year or future taxable years. In addition, the composition of our income and our assets will be affected by how, and how quickly, we spend our liquid assets. Under circumstances where our revenue from activities
	that produce passive income significantly increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce non-passive income, or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a
	PFIC may substantially increase.

	Furthermore, because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules, it is
	possible that the IRS may challenge our classification of certain income or assets as non-passive, or our valuation of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, each of which may result in our company becoming classified as a PFIC for the current
	or subsequent taxable years. For example, the IRS may challenge the classification of certain of our non-passive revenues as passive royalty income, which would result in a portion of our goodwill as being treated as a passive asset. If we are
	classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, we generally will continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares.

	Subject to the discussion below under &#147;Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,&#148; any cash distributions (including the amount of any
	PRC tax withheld) paid on our ADSs or ordinary shares out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as
	dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the U.S. Holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADSs. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of United
	States federal income tax principles, any distribution we pay will generally be treated as a &#147;dividend&#148; for United States federal income tax purposes. A non-corporate U.S. Holder will be subject to tax on dividend income from a
	&#147;qualified foreign corporation&#148; at a lower applicable capital gains rate rather than the marginal tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income provided that certain holding period requirements are met. A non-United States corporation
	(other than a corporation that is classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year) will generally be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (i)&nbsp;if it is eligible for the benefits
	of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States which the Secretary of Treasury of the United States determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and which includes an exchange of information program, or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to
	any dividend it pays on stock (or ADSs in respect of such stock) which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Our ADSs are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which is an established securities market in
	the United States, and the ADSs are readily tradable. Thus, the dividends we pay on our ADSs are expected to satisfy the conditions required for the reduced tax rates, but there can be no assurance that our ADSs will continue to be considered
	readily tradable on an established securities market in later years. Since we do not expect that our ordinary shares will be listed on an established securities market, it is unclear whether dividends that we pay on our ordinary shares that are not
	represented by ADSs will meet the conditions required for the reduced tax rate. However, in the event we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (see &#147;People&#146;s Republic of China Taxation&#148;
	above), we may be eligible for the benefits of the United States-PRC income tax treaty. If we are eligible for such benefits (which the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States has determined is satisfactory for this purpose), dividends we pay
	on our ADSs or ordinary shares, regardless of whether such shares are represented by the ADSs, would be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax
	rate on dividends with respect to our ADSs or ordinary shares in their particular circumstances. Dividends received on our ADSs or ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to corporations.

	Dividends will generally be treated as income from foreign sources for United States foreign tax
	credit purposes and will generally constitute passive category income. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a U.S. Holder may be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid
	on our ADSs or ordinary shares. Depending on the U.S. Holder&#146;s individual facts and circumstances, a U.S. Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit not in excess of any applicable treaty
	rate in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on our ADSs or ordinary shares. A U.S. Holder who does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction, for United States

	Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash, which is mostly held in
	interest-bearing bank deposits. We generated interest income of US$32 thousand, US$722&nbsp;thousand and US$7.8 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We had cash and cash equivalents of US$169.5 million as
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Assuming such amount of cash and cash equivalents were held entirely in interest-bearing bank deposits, a hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis-point) decrease in interest rates would decrease our interest income
	from these interest-bearing bank deposits for one year by approximately US$1.7 million. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to
	changes in market interest rates. However, our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market interest rates.

	Our revenues and costs are mostly denominated in RMB, and a significant portion of our financial assets are also
	denominated in RMB, whereas our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The Renminbi is not freely convertible into foreign currencies for capital account transactions. The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is
	affected by, among other things, changes in China&#146;s political and economic conditions and China&#146;s foreign exchange policies. On July&nbsp;21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the
	U.S. dollar, and the Renminbi appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a
	narrow band. Since June&nbsp;2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB
	and the U.S. dollar in the future. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.

	Our net revenues, as denominated in RMB, was RMB843.1 million in 2015. Assuming that we convert the full amount of our net revenues in 2015

	million in our net revenues in 2015. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB, from a rate of RMB6.2925 to US$1.00 to a rate of RMB5.6632 to US$1.00, will result in an increase of US$14.9 million in our net revenues in 2015.

	Designing and implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that
	requires us to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately satisfies our reporting obligations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
	misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
	degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

	NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5620 requires

	practice&#148; in certain corporate governance matters. Maples and Calder, our Cayman Islands counsel, has provided a letter to the NASDAQ Stock Market certifying that under Cayman Islands law, we are not required to hold annual shareholders
	meetings every year. We followed home country practice and did not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2015. We may, however, hold annual shareholders meetings in the future.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Momo Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), its subsidiaries, its variable interest entity
	(&#147;VIE&#148;), and its VIE&#146;s subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Group&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in (deficit) equity and cash
	flows for the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Group&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
	our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Group is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
	internal control over financial reporting. Our audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
	opinion on the effectiveness of the Group&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
	consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
	reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
	of the Group as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America.

	The Company believes that Beijing Momo IT and Beijing Momo&#146;s contractual arrangements with the VIE are in compliance with PRC law and are
	legally enforceable. Certain shareholders of Beijing Momo are also shareholders of the Company and therefore have no current interest in seeking to act contrary to the contractual arrangements. However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could
	limit the Company&#146;s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements and if the shareholders of the VIE were to reduce their interest in the Company, their interests may diverge from that of the Company and that may potentially increase the
	risk that they would seek to act contrary to the contractual terms, for example by influencing the VIE not to pay the service fees when required to do so.

	However, the Company cannot assure that when conflicts of interest arise, the shareholders will act in the best interests of the Company or
	that conflicts of interests will be resolved in the Company&#146;s favor. Currently, the Company does not have existing arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest the shareholders of the VIE may encounter in their capacity as the
	beneficial owners and director of the VIE on the one hand, and as beneficial owners and directors or officer of the Company, on the other hand. The Company believes the shareholders of the VIE will not act contrary to any of the contractual
	arrangements and the Exclusive Call Option Agreement provides the Company with a mechanism to remove the shareholders as the beneficial shareholders of the VIE should they act to the detriment of the Company. The Company relies on the VIE&#146;s
	shareholders, as directors and officer of the Company, to fulfill their fiduciary duties and abide by laws of the PRC and the Cayman and act in the best interest of the Company. If the Company cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes
	between the Company and the VIE&#146;s shareholders, the Company would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of its business, and there is substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.

	The Company&#146;s ability to control the VIE also depends on the Power of Attorney. Beijing Momo IT and Beijing Momo have to vote on all

	There are no consolidated VIE&#146;s assets that are collateral for the VIE&#146;s obligations and can only be used to settle the VIE&#146;s
	obligations. There are no creditors (or beneficial interest holders) of the VIE that have recourse to the general credit of the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. There are no terms in any arrangements, considering both explicit
	arrangements and implicit variable interests, that require the Company or its subsidiaries to provide financial support to the VIE. However, if the VIE ever needs financial support, the Company or its subsidiaries may, at its option and subject to
	statutory limits and restrictions, provide financial support to its VIE through loans to the shareholders of the VIE or entrustment loans to the VIE. Relevant PRC laws and regulations restrict the VIE from transferring a portion of its net assets,
	equivalent to the balance of its statutory reserve and its share capital, to the Company in the form of loans and advances or cash dividends. Please refer to Note 18 for disclosure of restricted net assets. The Group may lose the ability to use and
	enjoy assets held by the VIE that are important to the operation of business if the VIE declares bankruptcy or becomes subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding.

	investee&#146;s Board of Directors, voting rights and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. For the investment in limited partnerships, where the Group holds less

	revenue net of remittances. Purchases of in-game currencies are not refundable after they have been sold unless there is unused in-game currencies at the time a game is discontinued. Typically, a game will only be discontinued when the monthly
	revenue generated by a game becomes consistently insignificant. The Group does not currently expect to pay any material cash refunds to game players or game developers in connection with a discontinued game.

	reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The new revenue guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative

	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance supersedes existing
	guidance on accounting for leases with the main difference being that operating leases are to be recorded in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the lease
	payments. For operating leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. For public business entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the guidance is permitted. In transition, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period
	presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

	to income taxes, statement of cash flows, and forfeitures when accounting for share-based payment transactions. This new guidance will be effective for the Company for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, with earlier
	adoption permitted. Certain of the amendments related to timing of the recognition of tax benefits and tax withholding requirements should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method. Amendments related to the presentation of the
	statement of cash flows should be applied retrospectively. All other provisions may be applied on a prospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impacts of the adoption of this ASU.

	Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules which became effective on January 1, 2008, dividends generated after January 1, 2008 and payable
	by foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC to its foreign investors who are non-resident enterprises are subject to a 10% withholding tax, unless any such foreign investor&#146;s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with PRC that provides
	for a different withholding arrangement. Under the taxation arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong, a qualified Hong Kong tax resident which is the &#147;beneficial owner&#148; and directly holds 25% or more of the equity interest in a PRC
	resident enterprise is entitled to a reduced withholding tax rate of 5%. Cayman, where the Company is incorporated, does not have a tax treaty with PRC.

	Since January 1, 2011, the relevant tax authorities of the Group&#146;s subsidiaries have not conducted a tax examination on the Group&#146;s
	PRC entities. In accordance with relevant PRC tax administration laws, tax years from 2013 to 2015 of the Group&#146;s PRC subsidiary, VIE and VIE&#146;s subsidiaries, remain subject to tax audits as of December 31, 2015, at the tax authority&#146;s
	discretion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Uncertainties exist with respect to how the current income tax law in the PRC applies to the Group&#146;s overall operations,
	and more specifically, with regard to tax residency status. The EIT Law includes a provision specifying that legal entities organized outside of the PRC will be considered residents for Chinese income tax purposes if the place of effective
	management or control is within the PRC. The implementation rules to the EIT Law provide that non-resident legal entities will be considered China residents if substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business
	operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc., occurs within the PRC. Despite the present uncertainties resulting from the limited PRC tax guidance on the issue, the Group does not believe that the legal entities organized outside of the PRC
	within the Group should be treated as residents for EIT law purposes. If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside the PRC should be deemed resident enterprises, the Company and its
	subsidiaries registered outside the PRC will be subject to the PRC income taxes, at a rate of 25%.

	On May 8, 2015, China State Administration of Taxation issued a guidance (Bulletin [2015] No. 34) to clarify
	the deduction of payroll expenses and employee welfare expenses for enterprise income tax purposes. Based on the guidance, payroll expenses accrued in a calendar year may be deducted in the annual tax return for that year if the salaries are
	actually paid before the final annual enterprise income tax settlement. The majority of the Group&#146;s payroll expenses accrued in the year ended December 31, 2015 has been paid in the following year and the remaining is expected to be paid before
	the annual tax return, therefore it did not record the deferred tax assets arising from the accrued payroll as of December 31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	Group considers the following factors, among other matters, when determining whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized: the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future
	profitability, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods, the Group&#146;s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. The Group&#146;s ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on its ability to generate
	sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward periods provided for in the tax law.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December 31, 2015, the tax loss
	carry-forward for Beijing Momo and its subsidiaries amounted to $3,846, which would expire on various dates between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2015, the tax loss carry-forward for Momo HK amounted to $178, which
	would be carried forward indefinitely and set off against its future taxable profits. As of December 31, 2015, the tax loss carry-forward for Momo US amounted to $5,399, which would be carried forward for twenty years. The Group does not file
	combined or consolidated tax returns, therefore, losses from individual subsidiaries or the VIE may not be used to offset other subsidiaries&#146; or VIE&#146;s earnings within the Group. Valuation allowance is considered on each individual
	subsidiary and legal entity basis. Valuation allowances have been established in respect of certain deferred tax assets as it is considered more likely than not that the relevant deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future.

	In April 2012, the Company&#146;s four founding shareholders entered into an arrangement with the investor in conjunction with the
	issuance of Series A preferred shares, whereby all of their 147,000,000 ordinary shares (&#147;Founders&#146; shares&#148;) became subject to service and transfer restrictions. Such Founders&#146; shares are subject to repurchase by the Company upon
	early termination of their four years of employment. The repurchase price is the par value of the ordinary shares. 25% of the Founders&#146; shares shall be vested annually. The restricted share agreements were subsequently amended on June 11, 2012
	and July 18, 2012, respectively. Pursuant to the agreements, 25% of the Founders&#146; shares shall vest upon the closing of issuance of Series B preferred shares and the remaining 75% shall be vested monthly in equal installments over the next 36
	months. This arrangement has been accounted for as a grant of restricted stock awards subject to service vesting conditions. Because the modification does not affect any of the other terms or conditions of the award, presumably the fair value before
	and after the modification is the same.

	On May 15, 2014, the Company&#146;s four founding shareholders entered into an agreement with
	the investors to renew the arrangement. The Company considered the amendment of agreement as a modification of vesting of the restricted shares. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company shall be entitled to repurchase 50% and 25% of such shares in the
	case that founders terminate their employments with the Company before April 17, 2015 and during the period from April 17, 2015 to April 17, 2016, respectively, at a price of US$0.0001 per share or the lowest price permitted under applicable laws.
	Therefore, the Company considered that 50% of the total restricted shares were vested immediately on the amendment date and 25% shall be vested annually on April&nbsp;17 in the next two years ending April 17, 2016. Before the modification date, May
	15, 2014, there were 131,348,411 ordinary shares, of which 45,937,500 were unvested restricted shares. As the result of modification, 19,736,705 vested ordinary shares were classified to unvested restricted shares on the modification date and the
	corresponding compensation costs for these unvested restricted shares were amortized over the remaining service period. Because the modification does not affect any of the other terms or conditions of the award, the fair value of the restricted
	shares before and after the modification is the same.

	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Group has determined that its convertible redeemable participating
	preferred shares are participating securities as the preferred shares participate in undistributed earnings on an as-if-converted basis. The holders of the preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends on a pro rata basis, as if their shares
	had been converted into ordinary shares. The Group determined that the nonvested restricted shares are participating securities as the holders of the nonvested restricted shares have a nonforfeitable right to receive dividends with all ordinary
	shares but the nonvested restricted shares do not have a contractual obligation to fund or otherwise absorb the Company&#146;s losses. Accordingly, the Group uses the two-class method of computing net loss per share, for ordinary shares, nonvested
	restricted shares and preferred shares according to the participation rights in undistributed earnings.

	On October 22, 2015, the Group was served a civil complaint by Guangzhou Tian He People&#146;s Court in which the plaintiff claimed that
	Xiaoyao Xiyou, a game that the Group operated and currently operates, infringed upon the plaintiff&#146;s copyright in works of literature and art of a game, constituting unfair competition. The plaintiff demanded that the Group to cease the
	infringement and pay compensation and legal costs totalling approximately $1,544.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group believes the claim made by the plaintiff is
	without merit, and the Group intends to defend vigorously in the cases. Although the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, the Group does not believe the possibility of loss is probable. The Group is unable to estimate a range of loss, if
	any, that could result if there would be an adverse final decision, and the Group has not accrued a liability for the matter.

	In accordance with the Regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment of China and their articles of association, the
	Group&#146;s subsidiaries and VIE located in the PRC, being foreign invested enterprises established in the PRC, are required to provide for certain statutory reserves. These statutory reserve funds include one or more of the following: (i) a
	general reserve, (ii) an enterprise expansion fund or discretionary reserve fund, and (iii) a staff bonus and welfare fund. Subject to certain cumulative limits, the general reserve fund requires a minimum annual appropriation of 10% of after-tax
	profit (as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in China at each year-end); the other fund appropriations are at the subsidiaries&#146; or the affiliated PRC entities&#146; discretion. These statutory reserve funds can only be
	used for specific purposes of enterprise expansion, staff bonus and welfare, and are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation of our subsidiaries, our affiliated PRC entities and their respective subsidiaries. The
	Group&#146;s subsidiaries and VIE are required to allocate at least 10% of their after tax profits to the general reserve until such reserve has reached 50% of their respective registered capital.

	Relevant PRC laws and regulations restrict the WFOE, VIE and
	VIE&#146;s subsidiaries from transferring a portion of their net assets, equivalent to the balance of their statutory reserves and their paid in capital, to the Company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. The WFOE&#146;s accumulated
	profits may be distributed as dividends to the Company without the consent of a third party. The VIE and VIE&#146;s subsidiaries&#146; revenues and accumulated profits may be transferred to the Company through contractual arrangements without the
	consent of a third party. Under applicable PRC law, loans from PRC companies to their offshore affiliated entities require governmental approval, and advances by PRC companies to their offshore affiliated entities must be supported by bona fide
	business transactions. The capital and statutory reserves restricted which represented the amount of net assets of the WFOE, VIE and VIE&#146;s subsidiaries in the Group not available for distribution were $12,047, $93,537 and $91,008 as of December
