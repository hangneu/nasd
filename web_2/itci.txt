	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and clinical development of innovative, small molecule drugs that address
	underserved medical needs in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders by targeting intracellular signaling mechanisms within the central nervous system, or CNS. ITI-007 is our lead drug development candidate with mechanisms of action that, we
	believe, may represent an effective treatment across multiple therapeutic indications. In our pre-clinical and clinical trials to date, ITI-007 combines potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulation, or
	DPPM, glutamatergic modulation, and serotonin reuptake inhibition into a single drug candidate for the treatment of acute and residual schizophrenia and the treatment of bipolar disorder, including bipolar depression. At dopamine D2 receptors,
	ITI-007 has been demonstrated to have dual properties and to act as both a pre-synaptic partial agonist and a post-synaptic antagonist. ITI-007 has also been demonstrated to have affinity for dopamine D1 receptors and indirectly stimulate
	phosphorylation of glutamatergic NMDA GluN2B receptors in a mesolimbic specific manner. We believe that this regional selectivity in brain areas thought to mediate the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs, together with serotonergic, glutamatergic, and
	dopaminergic interactions, may result in efficacy for a broad array of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with improved psychosocial function. The serotonin reuptake inhibition potentially allows for antidepressant activity
	in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder, other disorders with co-morbid depression, and/or as a stand-alone treatment for major depressive disorder. We believe ITI-007 may also be useful for the treatment of other psychiatric and
	neurodegenerative disorders, particularly behavioral disturbances associated with dementia, autism, and other CNS diseases. ITI-007 is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression.

	ITI-007 for the Treatment of Schizophrenia

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In September 2015, we announced top-line clinical results from our first Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 for the treatment of patients with
	schizophrenia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 12 sites in the United States with 450 patients randomized (1:1:1)&nbsp;to receive either 60 mg of ITI-007, 40 mg of ITI-007 or placebo once
	daily in the morning for 28 days. The pre-specified primary efficacy measure was change from baseline versus placebo at study endpoint (4 weeks) on the centrally rated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, total score. In this trial, the
	once-daily dose of 60 mg of ITI-007 met the primary endpoint and demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy with statistically significant superiority over placebo at week 4 (study endpoint) with additional improvements observed in social function.
	Moreover, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 showed significant antipsychotic efficacy as early as week 1, which was maintained at every time point throughout the entire study. ITI-007 showed a dose-related improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia with the
	40 mg dose approximating the trajectory of improvement seen with the 60 mg dose, but the effect with 40 mg did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint. In addition, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 met the key secondary endpoint of
	statistically significant improvement on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity of Illness, or CGI-S. The 40 mg dose of ITI-007 also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the CGI-S, though not formally
	tested against placebo as a key secondary endpoint since it did not separate on the primary endpoint. Consistent with previous studies, ITI-007 had a favorable safety and tolerability profile as evidenced by motoric, metabolic, and cardiovascular
	characteristics similar to placebo, and no clinically significant changes in akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin, body weight, glucose, insulin, or lipids.

	In September 2015, we also announced top-line data from an open-label positron emission
	tomography, or PET, study of ITI-007 examining brain occupancy of striatal D2 receptors. This study was conducted in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who were otherwise healthy and stable with respect to their psychosis. After washout from
	their previous antipsychotic medication for at least two weeks, PET was used to determine target occupancy in brain regions at baseline (drug-free) and again after two weeks of once daily ITI-007 oral administration. In this trial, the 60 mg dose of
	ITI-007 was associated with a mean of approximately 40% striatal dopamine D

	The
	top-line results from our first Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 confirm the earlier Phase 2 results that we announced in December 2013, in which ITI-007 exhibited antipsychotic efficacy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled
	clinical trial in patients with an acutely exacerbated episode of schizophrenia. In this Phase 2 trial, 335 patients were randomized to receive one of four treatments: 60 mg of ITI-007, 120 mg of ITI-007, 4 mg of risperidone (active control) or
	placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, orally once daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint for this clinical trial was change from baseline to Day 28 on the PANSS total score. In this study, ITI-007 met the trial&#146;s pre-specified primary endpoint,
	improving symptoms associated with schizophrenia as measured by a statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrease in the PANSS total score. The trial also met key secondary outcome measures related to efficacy on PANSS subscales and
	safety. We are also conducting a second Phase 3 clinical trial in schizophrenia that we initiated in the second quarter of 2015, with over 600 patients planned to be enrolled in the trial. In this trial, we are randomizing patients to two doses of
	ITI-007 (60 mg or 20 mg), risperidone (active control) or placebo over a 6-week treatment duration, and the primary outcome measure is change from baseline to Day 42 on the PANSS total score. We expect patient enrollment will be completed in the
	second quarter of 2016. Subject to timely enrollment, we anticipate top-line results from the second Phase 3 clinical trial will be available in mid-2016.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our bipolar depression program consists of two Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials: one to
	evaluate ITI-007 as a monotherapy and the other to evaluate ITI-007 as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. In each trial, approximately 550 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder and who are experiencing
	a current major depressive episode will be randomized to receive one of three treatments: 60 mg ITI-007, 40 mg ITI-007, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio orally once daily for 6 weeks. In the ITI-007-401 trial, patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo as
	a monotherapy. In the ITI-007-402 trial, patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo adjunctive to their existing mood stabilizer lithium or valproate. We initiated our bipolar depression program in the third quarter of 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The primary endpoint for both clinical trials is change from baseline at Day 42 on the Montgomery-&Aring;sberg Depression Rating Scale, or
	MADRS, total score versus placebo. The MADRS is a well-validated 10-item checklist that measures the ability of a drug to reduce overall severity of depressive symptoms. Individual items are rated by an expert clinician on a scale of 0 to 6 in which
	a score of 6 represents the most depressed evaluation for each item assessed. The total score ranges from 0 to 60. Secondary endpoints include measures of social function and quality of life that may illustrate the differentiated clinical profile of
	ITI-007. Safety and tolerability are also assessed in both clinical trials.

	Other Indications for ITI-007
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced the top-line data from ITI-007-200, a Phase&nbsp;1/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the
	safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of low doses of ITI-007 in healthy geriatric subjects and in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer&#146;s disease. The completion of this study marks an important milestone in our strategy to develop
	low doses of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders. The ITI-007-200 trial results to date indicate that ITI-007 is safe and well-tolerated across a range of low doses, has linear- and
	dose-related pharmacokinetics and improves cognition in the elderly. The most frequent adverse event was mild sedation at the higher doses. We believe these results further position ITI-007 as a development candidate for the treatment of behavioral
	disturbances in patients with dementia and other neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. We plan to initiate late phase clinical programs evaluating ITI-007 in patients with behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related
	disorders, including Alzheimer&#146;s disease, in the first half of 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also pursuing clinical development of ITI-007 for the
	treatment of additional CNS diseases and disorders. At the lowest doses, ITI-007 has been demonstrated to act primarily as a potent 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonist. As the dose is increased, additional benefits are derived from the engagement
	of additional drug targets, including modest dopamine receptor modulation and modest inhibition of serotonin transporters. We believe that combined interactions at these receptors may provide additional benefits above and beyond selective 5-HT2A
	antagonism for treating agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in diseases that include dementia, Alzheimer&#146;s disease, Huntington&#146;s disease and autism spectrum disorders, while avoiding many of the side effects associated with more
	robust dopamine receptor antagonism. As the dose of ITI-007 is further increased, leading to moderate dopamine receptor modulation, inhibition of serotonin transporters, and indirect glutamate modulation, these actions complement the complete
	blockade of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. At a dose of 60 mg, ITI-007 has been shown effective in treating the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, and we believe this higher dose range will be useful for the treatment of bipolar disorder,
	depressive disorders and other neuropsychiatric diseases.

	additional indications, we may investigate, either on our own or with a partner, agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in additional diseases that include autism spectrum disorders; depressive disorder; intermittent explosive disorder;
	non-motor symptoms and motor complications associated with Parkinson&#146;s disease; and post-traumatic stress disorder. We hold exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights to ITI-007 and a family of compounds from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

	We have a second major program called ITI-002 that has yielded a portfolio of compounds that selectively inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase
	type 1, or PDE1. We believe PDE1 helps regulate brain activity related to cognition, memory processes and movement/coordination. On February&nbsp;25, 2011, we (through our wholly owned operating subsidiary, ITI) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company
	Limited, or Takeda, entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Takeda License Agreement, under which we agreed to collaborate to research, develop and commercialize our proprietary compound ITI-214 and other selected compounds that
	selectively inhibit PDE1 for use in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. On October&nbsp;31, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Takeda terminating the Takeda License Agreement, or the Termination Agreement, pursuant to which all
	rights granted under the Takeda License Agreement were returned to us. On September&nbsp;15, 2015, Takeda completed the transfer of the Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for ITI-214 to us. ITI-214 is the first compound in its class to
	successfully advance into Phase 1 clinical trials. We intend to pursue the development of our PDE program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, which may include cognition in Parkinson&#146;s disease, cognition
	in Alzheimer&#146;s disease, cognition in schizophrenia and in other non-CNS indications. Other compounds in the PDE portfolio are also being advanced for the treatment of various indications.

	Schizophrenia is a
	disabling and chronic mental illness that is characterized by multiple symptoms during an acute phase of the disorder that can include so-called &#147;positive&#148; symptoms, such as hearing voices, grandiose beliefs and suspiciousness or paranoia.
	These symptoms can be accompanied by additional, harder to treat symptoms, such as social withdrawal, blunted emotional response and speech deficits, collectively referred to as &#147;negative&#148; symptoms, difficulty concentrating and
	disorganized thoughts, or cognitive impairment, depression and insomnia. Such residual symptoms often persist even after the acute positive symptoms subside, and contribute substantially to the social and employment disability associated with
	schizophrenia. Current antipsychotic medications provide some relief for the symptoms associated with the acute phase of the disorder, but they do not effectively treat the residual phase symptoms associated with chronic schizophrenia. Currently
	available medications used to treat acute schizophrenia are limited in their use due to side effects that can include movement disorders, weight gain, metabolic disturbances, and cardiovascular disorders. Indeed, the side effects associated with
	current antipsychotic medications often make some of the residual phase symptoms, such as negative symptoms and social function, worse. There is an unmet medical need for new therapies that have improved side effect and efficacy profiles.

	According to the National Institute of Mental Health, over 1% of the world&#146;s population suffers from schizophrenia, and more than
	2.5&nbsp;million Americans suffer from the illness in any given year. Worldwide sales of antipsychotic drugs exceeded $14 billion in 2014. These drugs have been increasingly used by physicians to address a range of disorders in addition to
	schizophrenia, including bipolar disorder and a variety of psychoses and related conditions in elderly patients. Despite their commercial success, current antipsychotic drugs have substantial limitations, including inadequate efficacy and severe
	side effects.

	The first-generation, or typical, antipsychotics that were introduced in the late-1950s block

	Most schizophrenia patients in the United States are treated today with
	second-generation, or atypical, antipsychotics, which induce fewer motor disturbances than typical antipsychotics, but still fail to address most of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and other symptoms associated with social function
	impairment. Many patients with schizophrenia have deficits in social function. Social function is the ability to recognize, understand, process and use external cues to solve problems, maintain work performance, and conduct interpersonal
	relationships. Deficits in social function often remain after positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, have resolved in these patients. In addition, currently prescribed treatments do not effectively address or may exacerbate
	cognitive disturbances associated with schizophrenia. It is believed that the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics is due to their interactions with dopamine and 5-HT2A receptors. The side effects induced by the atypical agents may include weight
	gain, non-insulin dependent (type II) diabetes, cardiovascular side effects, sleep disturbances, and motor disturbances. We believe that these side effects generally arise either from non-essential receptor interactions or from excessive dopamine
	blockade.

	or atypical antipsychotics discontinued treatment within 18 months because of side effects or lack of efficacy. We believe there is a large underserved medical need for new therapies that have improved side effect and efficacy profiles.

	Our lead product candidate, ITI-007, possesses mechanisms of action that we believe may represent an effective treatment across multiple
	therapeutic indications. ITI-007 is in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia. In our pre-clinical and clinical trials to date, we have demonstrated that ITI-007 combines potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, dopamine
	receptor phosphoprotein modulation, or DPPM, glutamatergic modulation and serotonin reuptake inhibition into a single drug candidate for the treatment of acute and residual schizophrenia.&nbsp;At dopamine D2 receptors, ITI-007 has been demonstrated
	to have dual properties and to act as both a pre-synaptic partial agonist and a post-synaptic antagonist.&nbsp;ITI-007 has also been demonstrated to have affinity for dopamine D1 receptors and indirectly stimulate phosphorylation of glutamatergic
	NMDA NR2B, or GluN2B, receptors in a mesolimbic specific manner.&nbsp;We believe that this regional selectivity in brain areas thought to mediate the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs, together with serotonergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic
	interactions, may result in antipsychotic efficacy for positive, negative, affective and cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia.&nbsp;The serotonin reuptake inhibition could allow for antidepressant activity for the treatment of
	schizoaffective disorder, other disorders with co-morbid depression, and/or as a stand-alone treatment for major depressive disorder.&nbsp;We believe ITI-007 may also be useful for the treatment of bipolar disorder and other psychiatric and
	neurodegenerative disorders, particularly behavioral disturbances associated with dementia, autism and other CNS diseases.

	mg of ITI-007, 120 mg of ITI-007, 4 mg of risperidone (active control) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Patients received study treatment orally once daily in the morning for 28&nbsp;days. Of those randomized, 311 patients were included in the
	intent-to-treat primary analysis. Subject participation lasted approximately 7 to 8 weeks, including a one week screening period, a four week treatment period followed by stabilization on standard of care, and a safety follow up visit approximately
	two weeks after stabilization. The primary endpoint for this clinical trial was change from baseline to Day 28 on the PANSS total score. The PANSS is a well-validated 30-item rating scale that measures the ability of a drug to reduce schizophrenia
	symptom severity. The PANSS measures positive symptoms, such as delusions, suspiciousness, and hallucinations; negative symptoms, such as blunted affect, social and emotional withdrawal, and stereotyped thinking; and general psychopathology, such as
	anxiety, tension, depression, and active social avoidance.

	consistent with improvements in these social functioning deficits. The study also showed that ITI-007 was well-tolerated at the tested doses. ITI-007 demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the study without characteristic antipsychotic drug side

	We are proceeding with Phase 3 development of ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia. We are conducting two randomized, double-blind,
	placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials of ITI-007 in patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia. In September 2015, we announced top-line clinical results from our first Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 for the treatment of patients with
	schizophrenia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 12 sites in the United States with 450 patients randomized (1:1:1)&nbsp;to receive either 60 mg of ITI-007, 40 mg of ITI-007 or placebo once
	daily in the morning for 28 days. The pre-specified primary efficacy measure was change from baseline versus placebo at study endpoint (4 weeks) on the centrally rated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, total score. In this trial, the
	once-daily dose of 60 mg of ITI-007 met the primary endpoint and demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy with statistically significant superiority over placebo at week 4 (study endpoint) with additional improvements observed in social function.
	Moreover, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 showed significant antipsychotic efficacy as early as week 1, which was maintained at every time point throughout the entire study. ITI-007 showed a dose-related improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia with the
	40 mg dose approximating the trajectory of improvement seen with the 60 mg dose, but the effect with 40 mg did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint. In addition, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 met the key secondary endpoint of
	statistically significant improvement on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity of Illness, or CGI-S. The 40 mg dose of ITI-007 also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the CGI-S, though not formally
	tested against placebo since it did not separate on the primary endpoint. Consistent with previous studies, ITI-007 had a favorable safety and tolerability profile as evidenced by motoric, metabolic, and cardiovascular characteristics similar to
	placebo, and no clinically significant changes in akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin, body weight, glucose, insulin, or lipids. We are also conducting a second Phase 3 clinical trial in schizophrenia that we initiated in the second

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Behavioral disturbances are common in dementia and Alzheimer&#146;s disease. These disturbances are a major component of the burden to
	caregivers, and often lead to institutionalization. Although currently available treatments for patients with dementia mainly address cognitive disturbances, behavioral disturbances are considerably more problematic and likely more amenable to drug
	treatment. Several behavioral symptoms are quite prevalent in patients with dementia, including patients with Alzheimer&#146;s disease. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced the top-line data from ITI-007-200, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial
	designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of low doses of ITI-007 in healthy geriatric subjects and in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer&#146;s disease. The ITI-007-200 clinical trial was conducted in two parts.
	Part 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose evaluation of ITI-007 in healthy geriatric subjects. In each of three cohorts in Part 1, approximately 10 subjects were randomized to receive ITI-007 (N=8) or placebo
	(N=2) orally once daily in the morning for seven days. Doses of ITI-007 up to and including 30 mg were evaluated in three cohorts in Part 1. In Part 2, eight patients with dementia were randomized to receive 9 mg ITI-007 (N=5) or placebo (N=3)
	orally once a day in the evening for seven days. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ITI-007 in the elderly and in the target dementia patient population. Secondary measures were
	included to explore the effects of ITI-007 on cognition and agitation. The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-R, or HVLT-R, was used to assess cognition in healthy geriatric subjects and dementia patients. The results demonstrated impaired verbal learning
	and memory (recall and recognition memory) by dementia patients relative to healthy geriatric subjects. Moreover, the data indicated that healthy geriatric subjects treated with ITI-007 for approximately one week experienced an improvement in verbal
	learning and memory relative to placebo-treated subjects. Dementia patients treated with ITI-007 showed enhanced recognition memory, making fewer false positive errors (i.e., responding &#145;yes&#146; to non-target words) than patients treated with
	placebo. Other secondary endpoints in the ITI-007-200 clinical trial included the assessment of agitation. However, none of the study participants experienced agitation at baseline or during the study, and therefore no signals on this behavioral
	endpoint could be assessed. The completion of this study marks an important milestone in our strategy to develop low doses of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders. The ITI-007-200 trial
	results to date indicate that ITI-007 is safe and well-tolerated across a range of low doses, has linear- and dose-related pharmacokinetics and improves cognition in the elderly. The most frequent adverse event was mild sedation at the higher doses.
	We believe these results further position ITI-007 as a development candidate for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia and other neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. We plan to initiate additional clinical
	programs evaluating ITI-007 in patients with behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders, including Alzheimer&#146;s disease, in the first half of 2016.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A Phase 2 double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over clinical trial conducted in 19 patients with primary insomnia with disturbed sleep
	maintenance at low doses of ITI-007 was completed in 2008 in Europe. The primary outcome measure was slow wave sleep as determined by polysomnography. ITI-007 demonstrated a dose-related statistically significant increase in slow wave sleep.
	Secondary measures were consistent with improvement of sleep maintenance in patients with primary insomnia, indicated by decreased waking after sleep onset, increased total sleep time, and no increase in latency to sleep onset. At these low doses
	ITI-007 did not induce sleep, but rather helped maintain sleep once sleep had been initiated. In addition, ITI-007 was not associated with next day cognitive impairment, or &#147;hang-over&#148; effects. We believe that ITI-007 may be particularly
	useful in the treatment of sleep disorders that accompany neuropsychiatric and neurologic disorders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, Parkinson&#146;s disease and dementia. Previous work

	has suggested that selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonists increase deep, slow wave sleep in both humans and animals. We believe, however, that other neuropharmacological mechanisms, in addition to
	5-HT2A receptor antagonism, such as engaging some dopamine modulation, may be beneficial for the successful treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia, or SMI, in humans. We believe that ITI-007 represents a new approach to the treatment of sleep
	maintenance insomnia because of its unique pharmacology and neuropharmacological interactions beyond selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonism. We believe that ITI-007 offers a potentially new approach to the treatment of sleep maintenance disorders,
	particularly in those disorders that accompany neuropsychiatric and neurologic disorders. Many of these disorders are accompanied by profound sleep deficits, which impair daytime functioning including cognition, exacerbate disease symptoms and
	increase the cost of care. We are presently exploring clinical designs to incorporate the examination of sleep disturbances in one or more of these indications. There is no assurance that any such design would be sufficient for an FDA approval for

	Sleep problems are common in patients with ASD and are not adequately treated by currently available interventions. Approximately two thirds of
	children and adolescents with ASD experience sleep problems, higher than the rate of sleep problems in age-matched developmentally typical children. Moreover, individuals with ASD suffer from behavioral disturbances, including aggression,
	irritability, anxiety and depression. With its multiple pathway mechanism of action, we believe that ITI-007 could address the multi-faceted behavioral symptoms associated with ASD. 5-HT2A receptor antagonism is predicted to increase slow wave
	sleep, improve sleep maintenance and reduce aggression. D2 receptor modulation is predicted to improve sleep maintenance and reduce irritability and aggression. Serotonin reuptake inhibition is predicted to reduce anxiety and depression.
	Accordingly, we believe that ITI-007 could improve sleep maintenance, reduce behavioral disturbances and enhance social interaction in patients with ASD. We believe that our completed Phase 1 studies support advancing ITI-007 into Phase 2 trials in
	this patient population, and we are presently exploring the feasibility of such trials.

	We have a

	movement/coordination. In addition, PDE1 inhibitors may have utility in treating non-CNS disorders. On February&nbsp;25, 2011, we (through our wholly owned operating subsidiary, ITI) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, entered into
	a license and collaboration agreement, or the Takeda License Agreement, under which we agreed to collaborate to research, develop and commercialize our proprietary compound ITI-214 and other selected compounds that selectively inhibit PDE1 for use
	in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. Takeda conducted four Phase 1 studies. A single rising dose study was conducted in the U.S. in healthy male and female, Japanese and non-Japanese volunteers. In a second U.S. study, ITI-214 was
	administered once daily over 14 days to healthy volunteers and patients with stable schizophrenia. In a third study, conducted in Japan, ITI-214 was administered for seven days at multiple rising oral doses in both male and female healthy
	volunteers. A fourth study compared the relative bioavailability of oral formulations of ITI-214 used in all previous studies to an immediate-release tablet, either with or without food in healthy volunteers. In these studies, ITI-214 demonstrated a

	During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given an opportunity to meet with the FDA at
	certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about
	the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach an agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present
	their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to reach an agreement with the FDA that the protocol design, clinical endpoints,
	and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. If such an agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative
	record, and it will be binding on the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical studies begin, or if the

	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information

	Assuming successful completion of the required clinical
	testing, the results of pre-clinical studies and of clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval

	sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, will be filed by FDA at the end of that period. For NDAs assigned a standard review designation, the FDA&#146;s goal is to complete its review 12 months from submission and for priority review

	Before approving an NDA, the FDA inspects the facility or the
	facilities at which the drug and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMPs. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed
	acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or in some cases a Complete Response Letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require
	post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#146;s safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for
	approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or additional clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing.
	Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials is not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our

	Alternatively, the FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to mitigate risks of the drug, which could include medication guides, physician communication
	plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. Once the FDA approves a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if on-going regulatory requirements are not met
	or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products that have been

	After a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval
	requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. In addition, certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, or making certain additional labeling claims,
	are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA, typically a new NDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that
	additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are
	required to (i)&nbsp;report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events; (ii)&nbsp;comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for
	their products; and (iii)&nbsp;continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor&#146;s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities, which
	includes assessment of on-going compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. We intend to use third-party manufacturers to
	produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to
	correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall of the product from the market or withdrawal of approval of the NDA for

	Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.
</I>
	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of
	the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit
	a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14
	years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the
	approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the extension must be requested prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the
	application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the

	likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. We may need to conduct
	pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products for formulary coverage and reimbursement. Even with such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing products,

	with our second Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 for the treatment of schizophrenia. Although we have discussed our clinical development plans with the FDA, the agency may ultimately determine that our Phase 3 clinical trials and non-clinical
	studies, even if successfully completed, are not sufficient for regulatory approval. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials and non-clinical studies, our development of ITI-007 for schizophrenia will be more time-consuming and
	costly than we presently anticipate, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

	In June 2014, we held our end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss our plans for initiating Phase 3 clinical trials of ITI-007 in
	schizophrenia. Following this meeting, we proceeded with our Phase 3 development program, in which we recently completed the first of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials of ITI-007 in patients with acutely
	exacerbated schizophrenia, with 450 patients enrolled in the first Phase 3 clinical trial and over 600 patients planned to be enrolled in the second Phase 3 clinical trial. We completed enrollment of the first Phase 3 clinical trial in schizophrenia
	in the second quarter of 2015 and initiated enrollment of the second Phase 3 clinical trial in schizophrenia in the second quarter of 2015. In the first Phase 3 trial, we randomized patients to two doses of ITI-007 (60mg or 40mg) or placebo over a
	4-week treatment duration, and the primary outcome measure is change from baseline to Day 28 on the PANSS total score. In the second Phase 3 trial, we are randomizing patients to receive one of four treatments: 60 mg ITI-007, 20 mg ITI-007, 4 mg
	risperidone (active control) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The second Phase 3 trial is being conducted for a 6-week treatment duration. We announced top-line results of the first Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia in
	September 2015 and anticipate that the results of the second Phase 3 clinical trial will be available, subject to timely enrollment, in mid-2016. Even though we believe that our recently completed Phase 3 trial and our on-going Phase 3 clinical

	non-clinical studies for ITI-007 in schizophrenia, if successful, will be sufficient to support our NDA, the FDA may not agree with one or more aspects of our clinical trial designs, including
	the duration of the trials, clinical endpoints, controls, dose ranges, collection of safety data, or adequacy of our non-clinical studies. If we submit an NDA and the FDA does not agree with our clinical and non-clinical designs, our development of
	ITI-007 in schizophrenia and other indications may be delayed, and we may incur additional costs and devote additional resources to address any concerns the FDA may have with our trial designs. In addition, we may be required to conduct additional
	clinical trials or studies, which could result in additional delays and costs. There is no assurance that we will complete the Phase 3 trials and other clinical and non-clinical studies within the timeframes and the costs that we currently expect,
	or at all, or in a manner that is acceptable to the FDA. Any delays or unplanned costs resulting from our Phase 3 clinical trials of ITI-007 in schizophrenia may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
	condition. Even if we eventually complete Phase 3 clinical testing, submit an NDA and receive approval of ITI-007, the FDA may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional post-approval clinical trials. The FDA may also approve
	ITI-007 for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of ITI-007 or our other
	product candidates. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval for ITI-007 would delay or prevent commercialization of ITI-007 and would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and

	We have experienced significant net losses since our inception. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015,
	we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $193.0&nbsp;million. We expect to incur net losses over the next several years as we advance our programs and incur significant clinical development costs. We have not received, and do not expect to
	receive for at least the next several years, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates. Substantially all of our revenues to date were from our license and collaboration agreement with Takeda and our agreements with various
	U.S. governmental agencies and other parties, including our research and development grants. In October 2014, we entered into the Takeda Termination Agreement, which terminated our license and collaboration agreement with Takeda, pursuant to which
	all rights with respect to ITI-214 that we previously granted to Takeda were returned to us. We will not, therefore, receive any further milestone payments from Takeda and we cannot be certain that we will enter into additional collaboration

	enter into strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies or other industry participants to advance its programs and enable it to maintain its financial and operational capacity. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate
	alliances. If we seek such alliances, we may not be able to negotiate alliances on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, these alliances may be unsuccessful. On October&nbsp;31, 2014, we entered into the Termination Agreement with Takeda, which

	Manufacturers of our product candidates are obliged to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated
	current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products in compliance with the cGMPs requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process
	controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing,
	shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced cGMP requirements, other federal and state regulatory requirements and foreign regulations. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise
	fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations, our ability to provide product candidates in our clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial materials could delay the
	completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at significant additional expense or terminate the

	In addition, the facilities used by our contract manufacturers or other third party manufacturers to
	manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we request regulatory approval from the FDA. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and
	the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies
	may also implement new standards at any time, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. We have little control over our manufacturers&#146; compliance with these
	regulations and standards. A failure of any of our current or future contract manufacturers to establish and follow cGMPs and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in clinical trials or in obtaining regulatory
	approval of product candidates or the ultimate launch of products based on our product candidates into the market. Failure by our current or future third-party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being
	imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of the government to grant pre-market approval of drugs, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, and criminal
	prosecutions. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers&#146; failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our

	In addition, the market for any products for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party

	Third-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling
	health care costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to
	payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance
	that coverage will be obtained. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate payment levels for, our products from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and
	patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize any approved products and thereby adversely impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.

	In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to
	government control. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union
	provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a
	specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign
	countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with any products we may market, which could negatively impact our profitability.

	The patent positions of
	pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&#146;s, or USPTO&#146;s, standards are uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently,
	the issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, and U.S. patents may be
	subject to reexamination proceedings in the USPTO (and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office), which proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the
	patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. Similarly, opposition or invalidity proceedings could result in loss of rights or reduction in the scope of one or more claims of
	a patent in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, such interference, reexamination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or
	processes.

	In addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may permit
	others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products without providing any compensation to us or may limit the number of patents or claims we can obtain. In particular, there have been proposals to shorten the
	exclusivity periods available under U.S. patent law that, if adopted, could substantially harm our business. The product candidates that we are developing are protected by intellectual property rights, including patents and patent applications. If
	any of our product candidates becomes a marketable product, we will rely on our exclusivity under patents to sell the compound and recoup our investments in the research and development of the compound. If the exclusivity period for patents is
	shortened, then our ability to generate revenues without competition will be reduced and our business could be materially adversely impacted. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws, and
	those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights. For example, some countries, including many in Europe, do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans and, in these countries,
	patent protection may not be available at all to protect our product candidates. In addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect our products and/or technologies
	or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was recently signed into law and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These
	include changes to transition from a &#147;first-to-invent&#148; system to a &#147;first-to-file&#148; system and to the way issued patents are challenged. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have more resources to
	devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has been in the process of implementing regulations and procedures to administer the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith
	Act may affect our ability to obtain, enforce or defend our patents. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based
	on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend our issued patents.

	and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the

	We are required to comply
	with Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and
	testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm
	attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with this annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls
	and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire
	additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If we fail to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls or fail to comply in a timely manner with the requirements of
	the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, this could have a material adverse effect on our
	business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or
	other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or
	governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.

	Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Section&nbsp;404 requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate
	financial statements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in
	the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and to obtain an unqualified report on internal
	controls from our independent registered public accounting firm as required under Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our common stock, and could adversely affect our ability

	Overview

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a biopharmaceutical
	company focused on the discovery and clinical development of innovative, small molecule drugs that address underserved medical needs in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders by targeting intracellular signaling mechanisms within the central
	nervous system, or CNS. ITI-007 is our lead drug development candidate with mechanisms of action that, we believe, may represent an effective treatment across multiple therapeutic indications. In our pre-clinical and clinical trials to date, ITI-007
	combines potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulation, or DPPM, glutamatergic modulation, and serotonin reuptake inhibition into a single drug candidate for the treatment of acute and residual
	schizophrenia and for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including bipolar depression. At dopamine D2 receptors, ITI-007 has been demonstrated to have dual properties and to act as both a pre-synaptic partial agonist and a post-synaptic antagonist.
	ITI-007 has also been demonstrated to have affinity for dopamine D1 receptors and indirectly stimulate phosphorylation of glutamatergic NMDA GluN2B receptors in a mesolimbic specific manner. We believe that this regional selectivity in brain areas
	thought to mediate the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs, together with serotonergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic interactions, may result in efficacy for a broad array of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with improved
	psychosocial function. The serotonin reuptake inhibition potentially allows for antidepressant activity in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder, other disorders with co-morbid depression, and/or as a stand-alone treatment for major depressive
	disorder. We believe ITI-007 may also be useful for the treatment of other psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly behavioral disturbances associated with dementia, autism, and other CNS diseases. ITI-007 is in Phase 3 clinical
	development as a novel treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In September 2015, we announced top-line clinical results from our first Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 for the treatment of patients with
	schizophrenia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 12 sites in the United States with 450 patients randomized (1:1:1)&nbsp;to receive either 60 mg of ITI-007, 40 mg of ITI-007 or placebo once
	daily in the morning for 28 days. The pre-specified primary efficacy measure was change from baseline versus placebo at study endpoint (4 weeks) on the centrally rated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, total score. In this trial, the
	once-daily dose of 60 mg of ITI-007 met the primary endpoint and demonstrated antipsychotic efficacy with statistically significant superiority over placebo at week 4 (study endpoint) with additional improvements observed in social function.
	Moreover, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 showed significant antipsychotic efficacy as early as week 1, which was maintained at every time point throughout the entire study. ITI-007 showed a dose-related improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia with the
	40 mg dose approximating the trajectory of improvement seen with the 60 mg dose, but the effect with 40 mg did not reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint. In addition, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 met the key secondary endpoint of
	statistically significant improvement on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity of Illness, or CGI-S. The 40 mg dose of ITI-007 also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the CGI-S, though not formally
	tested against placebo as a key

	and cardiovascular characteristics similar to placebo, and no clinically significant changes in akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin, body weight, glucose, insulin, or lipids.

	In September 2015, we also announced top-line data from an open-label positron emission tomography, or PET, study of ITI-007 examining brain
	occupancy of striatal D2 receptors. This study was conducted in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who were otherwise healthy and stable with respect to their psychosis. After washout from their previous antipsychotic medication for at least two
	weeks, PET was used to determine target occupancy in brain regions at baseline (drug-free) and again after two weeks of once daily ITI-007 oral administration. In this trial, the 60 mg dose of ITI-007 was associated with a mean of approximately 40%
	striatal dopamine D

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The top-line results from our first
	Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 confirm the earlier Phase 2 results that we announced in December 2013, in which ITI-007 exhibited antipsychotic efficacy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled clinical trial in patients with
	an acutely exacerbated episode of schizophrenia. In this Phase 2 trial, 335 patients were randomized to receive one of four treatments: 60 mg of ITI-007, 120 mg of ITI-007, 4 mg of risperidone (active control) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, orally
	once daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint for this clinical trial was change from baseline to Day 28 on the PANSS total score. In this study, ITI-007 met the trial&#146;s pre-specified primary endpoint, improving symptoms associated with
	schizophrenia as measured by a statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrease in the PANSS total score. The trial also met key secondary outcome measures related to efficacy on PANSS subscales and safety. We are also conducting a
	second Phase 3 clinical trial in schizophrenia that we initiated in the second quarter of 2015, with over 600 patients planned to be enrolled in the trial. In this trial, we are randomizing patients to two doses of ITI-007 (60 mg or 20 mg),
	risperidone (active control) or placebo over a 6-week treatment duration, and the primary outcome measure is change from baseline to Day 42 on the PANSS total score. We expect patient enrollment will be completed in the second quarter of 2016.
	Subject to timely enrollment, we anticipate top-line results from the second Phase 3 clinical trial will be available in mid-2016.

	In
	addition to our two Phase 3 clinical trials, we will need to complete other clinical and non-clinical trials and manufacturing and pre-commercialization activities necessary to support the submission of a planned NDA for ITI-007 in schizophrenia,
	which we currently expect could occur in the first half of 2017.

	Our bipolar depression program consists of two Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind,
	placebo-controlled clinical trials: one to evaluate ITI-007 as a monotherapy and the other to evaluate ITI-007 as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. In each trial, approximately 550 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bipolar I or
	Bipolar II disorder and who are experiencing a current major depressive episode will be randomized to receive one of three treatments: 60 mg ITI-007, 40 mg ITI-007, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio orally once daily for 6 weeks. In the ITI-007-401 trial,
	patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo as a monotherapy. In the ITI-007-402 trial, patients will receive ITI-007 or placebo adjunctive to their existing mood stabilizer lithium or valproate. We initiated our bipolar depression program in the third

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced the top-line data from ITI-007-200, a Phase&nbsp;1/2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the
	safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of low doses of ITI-007 in healthy geriatric subjects and in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer&#146;s disease. The completion of this study marks an important milestone in our strategy to develop
	low doses of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and related disorders. The ITI-007-200 trial results to date indicate that ITI-007 is safe and well-tolerated across a range of low doses, has linear- and
	dose-related pharmacokinetics and improves cognition in the elderly. The most frequent adverse event was mild sedation at the higher doses. We believe these results further position ITI-007 as a development candidate for the treatment of behavioral
	disturbances in patients with dementia and other neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. We plan to initiate additional late phase clinical programs evaluating ITI-007 in patients with behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and
	related disorders, including Alzheimer&#146;s disease, in the first half of 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also pursuing clinical development of ITI-007
	for the treatment of additional CNS diseases and disorders. At the lowest doses, ITI-007 has been demonstrated to act primarily as a potent 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonist. As the dose is increased, additional benefits are derived from the
	engagement of additional drug targets, including modest dopamine receptor modulation and modest inhibition of serotonin transporters. We believe that combined interactions at these receptors may provide additional benefits above and beyond selective
	5-HT2A antagonism for treating agitation, aggression and sleep disturbances in diseases that include dementia, Alzheimer&#146;s disease, Huntington&#146;s disease and autism spectrum disorders, while avoiding many of the side effects associated with
	more robust dopamine receptor antagonism. As the dose of ITI-007 is further increased, leading to moderate dopamine receptor modulation, inhibition of serotonin transporters, and indirect glutamate modulation, these actions complement the complete
	blockade of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. At a dose of 60 mg, ITI-007 has been shown effective in treating the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, and we believe this higher dose range will be useful for the treatment of bipolar disorder,
	depressive disorders and other neuropsychiatric diseases.

	We expect that research and development expenses will

	additional personnel. We granted options to purchase 884,703 shares of our common stock in 2015 and have granted options to purchase an additional 347,137 shares of our common stock in January 2016. We also granted restricted stock units for 5,272

	Research and development expenses increased for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 by
	approximately $66.5 million, or 313%. This change is due primarily to an increase of approximately $47.1 million of costs associated with outside clinical testing and an increase of approximately $14.9 million from nonclinical testing in the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 over the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The vast majority of the increase is due to costs associated with conducting our ITI-007 Phase 3 clinical program in schizophrenia. In late 2014, we began a clinical trial of
	ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia and incurred the majority of the costs for this trial in 2015. In addition, we started our second Phase 3 clinical trial of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia in June 2015 and incurred significant costs for
	this trial in the second half of 2015. In December 2015, we commenced our Phase 3 clinical trials in bipolar disorder and have incurred approximately $3.6 million in costs through December&nbsp;31, 2015. In 2014, we did not incur significant costs
	related to clinical trials. Amounts paid to external parties comprise a large portion of our research and development costs. In the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we incurred approximately $76.8 million of costs to external parties who
	manufactured, tested and performed clinical trial related activities as compared to $16.3 million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Of these external costs, approximately $76.1 million in the year ended December&nbsp;30, 2015 and $16.0
	million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 were for ITI-007 related projects. The remaining amounts for each of these periods were spent on other projects. Internal costs are comprised primarily of labor, fringe benefits, materials, supplies
	and facilities and maintenance costs and were approximately $10.9 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in these internal costs is due primarily to hiring additional research and
	development employees in 2015 in addition to increased stock based compensation expense.

	As development of ITI-007 for the treatment of

	approval and manufacture material needed for clinical trial use, which includes non-clinical testing of the drug product and the creation of an inventory of drug product in anticipation of possible FDA approval. In addition we plan to spend
	increasing amounts to further our development of ITI-007 for other indications, including but not limited to, the treatment of

	3 clinical trial, which began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Partially offsetting this decrease were expenses of approximately $6.6 million incurred in 2014 as compared to $1.9 million in 2013 related to the manufacturing and other clinical and
	non-clinical testing of our ITI-007 product candidate and expenses of approximately $1.9 million related to our ITI-007-200 Phase 1/2 clinical trial in healthy geriatric and dementia patients incurred only in 2014. In addition, stock option expense
	increased by $1.7 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 due primarily to stock options granted in 2014.

	The research and development expenses incurred for amounts payable to external parties comprised
	a significant portion of our research and development expenses during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013. We incurred expenses of approximately $14.8 million and $18.8 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013,
	respectively, for amounts payable to external parties who manufactured, tested and performed clinical trial activities for all of our projects. We spent approximately $14.4 million and $18.3 million on external costs for the development of ITI-007
	for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the same periods, our internal research and development expenses for all projects were approximately $5.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The clinical development work
	related to ITI-007 requires the largest portion of our resources and, consequently, comprises the majority of our spending. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred total expenses of $18.8 million and $20.8 million,
	respectively, for all ITI-007 related projects and $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for all of our other projects. Total research and development expenses were approximately $21.2 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 as

	Through

	and payments received under the terminated Takeda License Agreement. We do not believe that grant revenue will be a significant source of funding in the near future, and Takeda has limited ongoing funding obligations following the termination of the
	Takeda License Agreement on October&nbsp;31, 2014. On March&nbsp;11, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,411,481 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $129.9 million and net proceeds of approximately $121.8

	For the year 2016, we expect to spend between approximately $130 million and $160 million. We
	expect these expenditures to be due primarily to the development of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia, behavioral disturbances in dementia, bipolar disorder and depressive disorders, our ITI-007 long acting injectable development program
	through pre-clinical and early clinical development, research and preclinical development of our other product candidates, the continuation of manufacturing activities in connection with the development of ITI-007, recurring expenses and costs to
	produce, develop and validate materials to be used in clinical and non-clinical studies related to ITI-007, and expenses associated with our other development programs and general operations.&nbsp;We expect that cash expenditures will continue to
	increase after 2016 as we further expand the ITI-007 clinical stage programs, the ITI-007 long acting injectable development program through pre-clinical and early clinical development; research and preclinical development of our other product
	candidates; the continuation of manufacturing, pre-commercial activities in connection with the development of ITI-007 and the early stage pre-commercial launch activities for ITI-007. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and

	We will
	require significant additional financing in the future to continue to fund our operations. We believe that we have the funding in place to complete the additional clinical and non-clinical trials, manufacturing and pre-commercialization activities
	needed for potential regulatory approval and commercialization of ITI-007 in patients with schizophrenia. With the remaining proceeds from our public offerings in March 2015 and September 2015, we believe that we have the funds to complete our
	proposed clinical trials of ITI-007 in bipolar disorder as a monotherapy and as an adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. We will also be funding clinical trials of ITI-007 for the treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia; preclinical
	and clinical development of ITI-007 long acting injectable development program; additional clinical trials of ITI-007; continued clinical development of our PDE program, including ITI-214; research and preclinical development of our other product
	candidates; and the continuation of manufacturing activities in connection with the development of ITI-007. We anticipate requiring additional funds to obtain regulatory approval for ITI-007 in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer&#146;s
	disease, for further development of ITI-007 in patients with bipolar disorder, depressive disorders and other indications, and for development of our other product candidates. We have incurred losses in every year since inception with the exception
	of 2011, when we received an up-front fee and a milestone payment related to the Takeda License Agreement. These losses have resulted in significant cash used in operations. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we used net cash in operating
	activities and purchases of equipment of approximately $103.1 million and expect to use additional cash of between approximately $130 and $160 million through the end of 2016. While we have several research and development programs underway, the
	ITI-007 program has advanced the furthest and will continue to consume increasing amounts of cash for conducting clinical trials and the testing and manufacturing of product material. As we continue to conduct the activities necessary to pursue FDA
	approval of ITI-007 and our other product candidates, we expect the amount of cash needed to fund operations to increase significantly over the next several years.

	We utilize the Black-Scholes model for estimating fair value of our stock options granted. Option valuation models, including the

	expected volatility and the expected life of the award. Restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value on the date of grant as determined by the closing stock price.

	Expected volatility rates are based on historical volatility of the common stock of comparable publicly traded entities and other factors due
	to the limited historical information about our common stock. The expected life of stock options is the period of time for which the stock options are expected to be outstanding. Given the limited historical exercise data, the expected life is

	2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset
	and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. The amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within
	those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We have elected to adopt this update as of the fourth quarter of 2015, retrospectively. The adoption of this

	In May 2014, the Financial

	current GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09
	also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to

	We conducted our audits in

	In our opinion,

	operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, ITI, Inc. (&#147;ITI&#148;), is a
	biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and clinical development of innovative, small molecule drugs that address underserved medical needs in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders by targeting intracellular signaling mechanisms
	within the central nervous system (&#147;CNS&#148;). The Company&#146;s lead product candidate, ITI-007, is in Phase 3 clinical development as a novel treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	ITI was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May&nbsp;22, 2001 under the name &#147;Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc.&#148; and commenced operations in
	June&nbsp;2002. ITI was founded to discover and develop drugs for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On August&nbsp;29, 2013, ITI
	completed a reverse merger (the &#147;Merger&#148;) with a public shell company named Oneida Resources Corp. (&#147;Oneida&#148;). Oneida was formed in August 2012 as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warranted, acquire a target
	company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. In the Merger, each outstanding share of capital stock of ITI was exchanged for 0.5 shares of common stock of Oneida, and each outstanding option to purchase
	one share of ITI common stock and each outstanding warrant to purchase one share of ITI common stock was assumed by Oneida and became exercisable for 0.5 shares of Oneida common stock. As a result of the Merger and related transactions, ITI survived
	as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oneida, Oneida changed its fiscal year end from March&nbsp;31 to December&nbsp;31, and Oneida changed its name to Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;). In addition, the Company began operating ITI
	and its business, and therefore ceased being a shell company. Following the Merger and the redemption of all then outstanding shares of Oneida at the closing of the Merger, the former stockholders of ITI owned 100% of the shares of the
	Company&#146;s outstanding capital stock.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;), Accounting Standards Codification
	(&#147;ASC&#148;) Topic 805,
<I>
	Business Combinations
</I>
	, ITI is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and has accounted for the transaction as a capital transaction, because ITI&#146;s former stockholders received 100% of the voting
	rights in the combined entity and ITI&#146;s senior management represented all of the senior management of the combined entity. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in the Company&#146;s
	consolidated financial statements are those of ITI and have been recorded at the historical cost basis of the Company. All share and per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to
	reflect the one-for-0.5 shares of capital stock exchange as well as the conversion of the Notes (defined below) and the Series A, B, and C redeemable convertible preferred stock of ITI.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Immediately prior to the Merger, on August&nbsp;29, 2013, ITI sold to accredited investors approximately $60.0 million of its shares of common stock, or
	18,889,307 shares at a price of $3.1764 per share (the &#147;Private Placement&#148;), which included $15.3 million in principal and $0.8 million in accrued interest from the conversion of ITI&#146;s then outstanding convertible promissory notes
	(the &#147;Notes&#148;).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	Investment securities may consist of investments in U.S. Treasuries, various U.S. governmental agency debt securities, corporate bonds, certificates of
	deposit, and other fixed income securities with an average maturity of twelve months or less. Management classifies the Company&#146;s investments as available-for-sale. Such securities are carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized
	holding gains or losses reported, net of any tax effects reported, as accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be
	other-than-temporary, if any, are included in consolidated results of operations. A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in fair value, which is
	charged to earnings in that period, and a new cost basis for the security is established. Dividend and interest income is recognized as interest income when earned. The cost of securities sold is calculated using the specific identification method.

	for certain costs incurred on specified research projects under the terms and conditions of grants, collaboration agreements, and awards. The Company records the amount of reimbursement as revenues on a gross basis in accordance with ASC Topic
	605-45,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition/Principal Agent Considerations
</I>
	. The Company is the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, is obligated to compensate the service provider for the work performed,

	all Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (&#147;MDRAs&#148;) entered into on or after January&nbsp;1, 2011, and for any MDRAs that were entered into prior to January&nbsp;1, 2011, but materially modified on or after that date.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Except for payments made in advance of services, the Company expenses its research and development costs as incurred. For payments made in advance, the Company
	recognizes research and development expense as the services are rendered. Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel and resources and the costs of clinical trials. Other research and development
	expenses include preclinical analytical testing, outside services, providers, materials and consulting fees.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Costs for certain development activities,
	such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to the Company by its vendors with respect to
	their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and
	development expense, as the case may be.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its expenses
	resulting from its obligations under contracts with vendors, clinical research organizations and consultants and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to
	negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. The Company&#146;s objective is to reflect the appropriate trial
	expenses in its financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services are performed and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by subject
	progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. The Company determines accrual estimates through financial models taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of
	consummation of trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, the Company adjusts its clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from its estimates. The Company makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of
	each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to it at that time. The Company&#146;s clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors.
	Although the Company does not expect its estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, its understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary
	and may result in it reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, there were no material adjustments to the Company&#146;s prior period estimates of accrued expenses
	for clinical trials.

	Share-based payments are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic&nbsp;718,
<I>
	Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation
</I>
	. The fair value of
	share-based payments is estimated, on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model (the &#147;Black-Scholes model&#148;). The resulting fair value is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally
	the vesting period of the option.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For all awards granted with time-based vesting conditions, expense is amortized using the straight-line attribution
	method. For awards that contain a performance-based vesting condition, expense is amortized using the accelerated attribution method. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
	2015, 2014 and 2013 is based on share-based awards ultimately expected to vest, and this amount has therefore been reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary,
	in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Pre-vesting forfeitures were estimated based on the Company&#146;s historical experience and have not been material.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes model for estimating fair value of its stock options granted. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes
	model, require the input of subjective assumptions, and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award. These assumptions include the risk-free rate of interest, expected dividend yield, expected
	volatility and the expected life of the award. Restricted stock units are valued at the fair market value on the date of grant as determined by the closing stock price.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Expected volatility rates are based on historical volatility of the common stock of comparable publicly traded entities and other factors due to the limited

	Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2014, given that there was no active market for the Company&#146;s common stock, the exercise price of the stock options on the date

	offerings and general industry and economic trends. In establishing the estimated fair value of the common stock, the Company considered the guidance set forth in American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide,
<I>
	Valuation of
	Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation

	a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09 also will require additional
	disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a

	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences that exist between the carrying amounts of assets
	and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had $174.8
	million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire at various dates through 2035. The gross amount of the state net operating loss carryforwards is equal to or less than the federal net operating loss carryforwards and expires over
	various periods based on individual state tax law. In general, businesses with U.S. net operating losses (&#147;NOLs&#148;) are considered loss corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Pursuant to Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, loss
	corporations that undergo an ownership change, as defined under the Code, may be subject to an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs (and certain other tax attributes)

	an ownership change occurred (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;382 of the Code) in 2015. Based on the analysis performed, however, the Company does not believe that the Section&nbsp;382 annual limitation will impact the Company&#146;s ability to

	The Bristol-Myers Squibb License Agreement
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On
	May&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company entered into a worldwide, exclusive License Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (&#147;BMS&#148;), pursuant to which the Company holds a license to certain patents and know-how of BMS relating to ITI-007 and
	other specified compounds. The agreement was amended on November&nbsp;3, 2010. The licensed rights are exclusive, except BMS retains rights in specified compounds in the fields of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.
	However, BMS has no right to use, develop or commercialize ITI-007 and other specified compounds in any field of use. The Company has the right to grant sublicenses of the rights conveyed by BMS. The Company is obliged under the license to use
	commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed technology. The Company is also prohibited from engaging in the clinical development or commercialization of specified competitive compounds.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the agreement, the Company made an upfront payment of $1.0 million to BMS, a milestone payment of $1.25 million in December 2013, and a milestone
	payment of $1.5 million in December 2014 following the initiation of the Company&#146;s first Phase 3 clinical trial for ITI-007 for patients with exacerbated schizophrenia. Possible milestone payments remaining total $12.0 million. Under the
	agreement, the Company may be obliged to make other milestone payments to BMS for each licensed product of up to an aggregate of approximately $14.75 million. The Company is also obliged to make tiered single digit percentage royalty payments on
	sales of licensed products. The Company is obliged to pay to BMS a percentage of non-royalty payments made in consideration of any sublicense.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	agreement extends, and royalties are payable, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, through the later of ten years after first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country, expiration of the last licensed patent covering a
	licensed product, its method of manufacture or use, or the expiration of other government grants providing market exclusivity, subject to certain rights of the parties to terminate the agreement on the occurrence of certain events. On termination of
	the agreement, the Company may be obliged to convey to BMS rights in developments relating to a licensed compound or licensed product, including regulatory filings, research results and other intellectual property rights.

	The Takeda Pharmaceutical License and Collaboration Agreement and Termination Agreement
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On February&nbsp;25, 2011, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited under which the Company
	agreed to collaborate to research, develop and commercialize its proprietary compound ITI-214 and other selected compounds that selectively inhibit PDE1 for use in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. As part of the agreement, the Company
	assigned to Takeda certain patents owned by the Company that claim ITI-214 and granted Takeda an exclusive license to develop and commercialize compounds identified in the conduct of the research program that satisfy specified criteria. However, the
	Company retained rights to all compounds that do not meet the specified criteria and the Company continues to develop PDE1 inhibitors outside the scope of the agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of the agreement, the Company conducted a research program with an initial term of three years to identify and characterize compounds that
	meet certain specified criteria sufficient for further development by Takeda. This research program ended in February 2014. The Company was responsible for its expenses incurred in the conduct of certain research activities specified in the research
	plan. Takeda agreed to reimburse the Company for expenses the Company incurred in conducting additional research activities.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon execution of the
	agreement, Takeda made a nonrefundable payment to the Company. The Company was eligible to receive payments of approximately $500 million in the aggregate upon achievement of certain development milestones and up to an additional $250 million in the
	aggregate upon achievement of certain sales-based milestones, along with tiered royalty payments ranging from the high single digits to the low teens in percent based on net sales by Takeda.

	On October&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Takeda terminating the Takeda License
	Agreement, pursuant to which all rights granted under the Takeda License Agreement were returned to the Company. On September&nbsp;15, 2015, Takeda completed the transfer of the IND for ITI-214 to the Company. ITI-214 is the first compound in its
	class to successfully advance into Phase 1 clinical trials. The Company intends to explore the development of its PDE program, including ITI-214 for the treatment of several CNS and non-CNS conditions, which may include cognition in Parkinson&#146;s
	disease, cognition in Alzheimer&#146;s disease, cognition in schizophrenia and in other non-CNS indications. Other compounds in the PDE portfolio are also being advanced for the treatment of various indications.

	diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system disorders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The License expires upon expiration of the patent rights or 15 years subsequent to the first
	sale of products developed through this License. ITI is required to make future milestone payments for initiation of clinical trials and approval of a New Drug Application (&#147;NDA&#148;). Should ITI commercialize the technology related to this
	License, ITI would be required to make royalty payments, and would also be required to pay fees under any sublicense agreements with third parties.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	addition, ITI is required to use at least $1.0&nbsp;million annually of its resources for the development and commercialization of the technology until ITI submits an NDA. ITI met its spending requirements in 2015. There were no other payments made
	or required under the License for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014.

	time, consistent with the Bylaws of the Company and as required by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;). During the term of his employment with the Company, Executive will devote his best efforts and substantially all of his
	business time and attention to the business of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of this Agreement, it shall not be a breach or violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (i)&nbsp;serve on civic or charitable
	boards or committees, (ii)&nbsp;with the express written permission of the Company serve on corporate boards of companies that do not present a conflict of interest or compete directly or indirectly with the Company, (iii)&nbsp;deliver lectures,

	shall refer both to the initial term and any successive term as the context requires. Should the Company elect not to renew this Agreement for reasons other than death or Disability (as defined in Section&nbsp;4.3 below), or Cause (as defined in
	Section&nbsp;4.1 below), the Executive shall be eligible for the same severance payments and benefits as Executive would receive under Section&nbsp;5.2 and on the same conditions as if Executive had been terminated by the Company without Cause,

	This
	Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics and Whistleblower Policy, referred to as the &#147;Code,&#148; is intended to provide our associates, as defined below, with a clear understanding of the principles of business conduct and ethics that are
	expected of them and to aid them in making ethical and legal decisions when conducting the company&#146;s business and performing day-to-day duties. The standards set forth in the Code apply to us all. Every associate of the company must acknowledge
	his or her review of, and agreement to comply with, the Code as a condition of his or her relationship with the company (see
<U>
	Appendix A
</U>
	attached hereto). The term &#147;associate&#148; as used throughout the Code means (i)&nbsp;every full and
	part-time employee of the company and its subsidiaries, (ii)&nbsp;all members of the company&#146;s senior management, including the company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and (iii)&nbsp;every member of the
	company&#146;s Board of Directors, even if such member is not employed by the company.

	It is our responsibility to conduct ourselves in an ethical business manner and also to ensure that others do
	the same. If any one of us violates these standards, he or she can expect a disciplinary response, up to and including termination of any employment or other relationship with the company, and possibly other legal action. If you are aware of any
	breach of the Code, you are obligated to report violations to the Corporate Compliance Officer, to any member of the Compliance Committee, or to the anonymous Hotline that the company has retained to receive such reports, as described in more detail
	below. Through establishing a confidential and anonymous option to accept and process such reports, we ensure that the good faith efforts of all of us to comply with the Code are not undermined.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Code contains a clear anti-retaliation pledge, meaning that if you in good faith report a violation of the Code by the company, or its
	agents acting on behalf of the company, to the Hotline, the Corporate Compliance Officer or another member of the Compliance Committee, the company will undertake to protect you from being fired, demoted, reprimanded or otherwise harmed for
	reporting the violation, even if the violation involves you, your supervisor, or senior management of the company. Note, however, that while you will not be disciplined for reporting a violation, you may be subject to discipline with respect to the
	underlying conduct or violation. You are entitled to make the report on a confidential and anonymous basis. To the extent an investigation must be initiated, the company will keep confidential any report you make to the Corporate Compliance Officer
	or another member of the Compliance Committee to the extent required by applicable law.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The ultimate responsibility for maintaining our Code rests with each of us. As individuals of personal integrity, we can do no less than to
	behave in a way that will continue to bring credit to ourselves and our company. Applying these standards to our business lives is an extension of the values by which we are known as individuals and by which we want to be known as a company. To that
	end, the company has made the Code publicly available on its web site. It is our responsibility to conduct ourselves in an ethical business manner and also to ensure that others do the same. If any one of us violates these standards, he or she can
	expect a disciplinary response, up to and including termination of any employment or other relationship with the company, and possibly other legal action.

	While it is impossible for this Code to describe every situation that may arise, the standards explained in this Code are guidelines that
	should govern our conduct at all times. If you are confronted with situations not covered by this Code, or have questions regarding the matters that are addressed in the Code, you are urged to consult with the Corporate Compliance Officer, a member
	of the Compliance Committee, or another member of management. Furthermore, the policies set forth in this Code are in addition to other policies of the company that associates must comply with, including those set forth in the company&#146;s
	Employee Handbook and the other policies referenced in the Code. Copies of these other policies are available from the Human Resources Department or on the company&#146;s Intranet.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The provisions of the Code regarding the actions the company will take are guidelines which the company intends to follow. There may be
	circumstances, however, that in the company&#146;s judgment require different measures or actions and in such cases it may act accordingly while still attempting to fulfill the principles underlying this Code.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the case of any inconsistency between the provisions set out in this Code and the rules contained in any mandatory text, laws or
	interpretive case law applicable to the company and its associates, the latter prevail. In no instance should this Code be interpreted as modifying, amending or otherwise changing any legal text and related legal precedents that apply to the company
	and its associates.

	Any associate of the company having any information or knowledge regarding the existence of any violation or suspected violation of
	the Code has a duty to report the violation or suspected violation to the Whistleblower Hotline (the contact details for which are below), the Corporate Compliance Officer, or any other member of the Compliance Committee. Associates are also
	encouraged to raise any issues or concerns regarding the company&#146;s business or operations. Failure to report suspected or actual violations is itself a violation of the Code and may subject the associate to disciplinary action, up to and
	including termination of employment or legal action. Reports may be made on a completely confidential and anonymous basis. To the extent any investigation is necessitated by a report, the company will endeavor to keep the proceedings and the
	identity of the reporting associate confidential to the fullest extent required by applicable law.

	Individuals
	should also consider leaving, but are not required to leave, their name or a contact number when submitting a report. Such information may facilitate a more thorough and efficient investigation. The Corporate Compliance Officer will strive to
	maintain the integrity and confidentiality of all compliance-related communications. However, in certain circumstances, the identity of the person reporting the issue may become known or may need to be revealed, particularly if federal or state
	enforcement authorities become involved in the investigation. The company cannot guarantee confidentiality when material evidence of a violation of the law is disclosed or if the person is identified during the normal course of an investigation.

	concerns with the company&#146;s business or operations, suspected violations of the Code, securities or antifraud laws, accounting issues, any law relating to fraud against shareholders, or any other issue concerning the company and their
	employment with the company. Reports made to the Hotline will, in turn, be provided directly to the Audit Committee on an anonymous and confidential basis. The Hotline may be reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at the following toll-free number

	Federal and state antitrust laws are intended to preserve the free enterprise system by ensuring that competition is the primary regulator of
	the economy. Every corporate decision that involves customers, competitors, and business planning with respect to output, sales and pricing raises antitrust issues. Compliance with the antitrust laws is in the public interest, in the interest of the

	Failing to recognize antitrust risk is costly. Antitrust litigation can
	be very expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, violations of the antitrust laws can, among other things, subject you and the company to the imposition of injunctions, treble damages, and heavy fines. Criminal penalties may also be imposed, and
	individual associates can receive heavy fines or even be imprisoned. For this reason, antitrust compliance should be taken seriously at all levels within the company.

	The concept of who is an &#147;insider&#148; is broad. It includes officers, directors and employees of a

	company&#146;s purpose. A temporary insider can include, among others, a company&#146;s investment advisors, agents, attorneys, accountants and lending institutions, as well as the employees of such organizations. An associate may also become a

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:6%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the knowing and willful payment of remuneration to a physician, hospital or other source with the

	application is very complicated. A violation of the federal anti-kickback statute can result in severe penalties, including criminal conviction, fines and exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs. Many other jurisdictions, including many

	Yes, participation in the Code and its compliance program is mandatory. You must immediately report any suspected or actual violation
	of the Code to the Hotline, the Corporate Compliance Officer or a member of the Compliance Committee. The company will keep reports confidential to the fullest extent required by applicable law. Failure to report suspected or actual violations is
	itself a violation of the Code and may subject you to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or legal action.

	The Code contains a clear anti-retaliation pledge, meaning that if you in good faith report a violation of the Code by the company,
	or its agents acting on behalf of the company, to the Hotline, the Corporate Compliance Officer or another member of the Compliance Committee, the company will undertake to protect you from being fired, demoted, reprimanded or otherwise harmed for
	reporting the violation, even if the violation involves you, your supervisor, or senior management of the company. Note, however, that while you will not be disciplined for reporting a violation, you may be subject to discipline with respect to the
	underlying conduct or violation. You are entitled to make the report on a confidential and anonymous basis. To the extent an investigation must be initiated, the company will keep confidential any report you make to the Corporate Compliance Officer
	or another member of the Compliance Committee to the extent required by applicable law.

	In addition, if you in good faith report a
	suspected violation under the Code which you reasonably believe constitutes a violation of a federal statute by the company, or its agents acting on behalf of the company, to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, you may not be
	reprimanded, discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of your employment for reporting the suspected violation, regardless of whether the suspected violation involves
	you, your supervisor or senior management of the company.

	Individuals should also consider leaving, but are not required to leave, their name or a contact

	However, in certain circumstances, the identity of the person reporting the issue may become known or may need to be revealed, particularly if federal or state enforcement authorities become involved in the investigation. The company cannot

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:6%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<B>
	A:
</B>
	When a suspected violation is reported to the Hotline, the Corporate Compliance Officer or a member of the Compliance Committee, the
	Compliance Committee will gather information about the allegation by interviewing the associate reporting the suspected violation, the associate who is accused of the violation and/or any co-workers or associates of the accused associates to
	determine if a factual basis for the allegation exists. The reporting associate&#146;s immediate supervisor will not be involved in the investigation if the reported violation involved that supervisor. The company will keep the identity of the
	reporting associate confidential to the fullest extent required by applicable law.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:6%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the report is not substantiated, the reporting

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:6%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the allegation is substantiated, the Compliance Committee will make a judgment as to the degree of severity of the violation and the
	appropriate disciplinary response. In more severe cases, the Compliance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the company for its approval. The Board&#146;s decision as to disciplinary and corrective action will be final.
	In the case of less severe violations, the Corporate Compliance Officer may refer the violation to the individual&#146;s supervisor for appropriate disciplinary action.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:6%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	The Corporate Compliance Officer and any member of the Compliance Committee can help answer questions you may have under the Code.
	Particularly difficult questions will be answered with input from the Compliance Committee as a whole. In addition, Section IX of the Code provides information on how you may obtain a waiver from the Code; waivers will be granted only in very
	limited circumstances. You should never pursue a course of action that is unclear under the Code without first consulting the Corporate Compliance Officer or the Compliance Committee, and if necessary, obtaining a waiver from the Code.
