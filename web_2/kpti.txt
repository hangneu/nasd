	We are a clinical-stage
	pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and subsequent commercialization of novel, first-in-class drugs directed against nuclear transport and related targets for the treatment of cancer and other major diseases. Our scientific
	expertise is focused on understanding the regulation of intracellular communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We have discovered and are developing wholly-owned, novel, small molecule

	xport,
</B>
	or
<B>
	SINE&#153;
</B>
	, compounds that inhibit the nuclear export protein XPO1. These SINE compounds represent a new class of drug candidates with a novel mechanism of action that have the potential to treat a variety
	of diseases in areas of unmet medical need. Our SINE compounds were the first oral XPO1 inhibitors in clinical development.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our initial
	focus is on seeking the regulatory approval and commercialization of our lead drug candidate, selinexor (KPT-330), as an orally administered agent in cancer indications with significant unmet clinical need, initially for hematologic malignancies. We
	then plan to seek additional approvals for the use of selinexor in combination therapies to expand the patient populations that are eligible for selinexor, as well as to move selinexor further towards front-line cancer therapy. We are also advancing
	the clinical development of selinexor in multiple solid tumor indications. To date, we have initiated multiple later-phase clinical trials to evaluate selinexor in hematological cancers and solid tumors. We have also initiated a double-blinded,
	placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2/3 study of single-agent selinexor in liposarcoma and expect to initiate in the middle of 2016 a double-blinded, randomized Phase 2/3 study of selinexor in combination with carfilzomib (Kyprolis

	Summary of Clinical Development
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Oral selinexor is being evaluated in multiple later-phase clinical trials in patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematological and solid
	tumor malignancies. To date, selinexor has been administered to more than 1400 patients across company-sponsored and investigator-sponsored clinical trials. Evidence of single-agent anti-cancer activity has been observed in many patients and
	selinexor has been sufficiently well-tolerated to allow several of these patients to remain on therapy for prolonged periods. Over 20 patients have remained on study for over 12&nbsp;months, with the longest patients on study for over 24 months.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During 2015, a diverse set of clinical data for selinexor was presented across a variety of indications. We presented an analysis of data
	from 266 patients with hematological malignancies who were treated with selinexor during our Phase 1 clinical trial. The primary objectives of the Phase&nbsp;1 trial were to determine the safety, tolerability and recommended Phase&nbsp;2 and Phase 3
	dose of orally administered selinexor. Patients were dosed
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	3-80mg/m

<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	2
</SUP>
	(equivalent to approximately 5-130mg) of selinexor orally over a four-week cycle, with
	lower doses initially given ten times per cycle and higher doses usually given twice weekly. Data indicate that significantly less weight loss was observed in patients who received selinexor dosed at 60mg or less, that patients treated with 60mg or
	less of selinexor remained on the study longer than patients treated with selinexor dosed at 65mg or higher and that selinexor dosed at approximately 60mg is associated with maximal overall response rates. Pharmacokinetics for selinexor based on
	flat dose was comparable to dosing based on body surface area. As a result of this analysis, we concluded that the recommended Phase 2 dose for selinexor in most cancer indications is 60mg given twice weekly and we believe that this dose optimizes
	the therapeutic window, response rates and duration of treatment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Selinexor data were also presented showing preliminary safety and
	efficacy as a single agent in patients with solid tumors including glioblastoma, sarcoma and gynecological malignancies, in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone to treat patients with multiple myeloma and in combination with standard of
	care chemotherapy to treat patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

	In addition to selinexor, we are also advancing a pipeline of novel drug candidates in both oncology and neurological, inflammatory,
	autoimmune and viral indications. We began clinical testing of KPT-8602, a second generation SINE compound, in December 2015 to treat patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and we expect to being clinical testing of KPT-9274, a dual
	PAK4/NAMPT inhibitor in the middle of 2016 in patients with lymphoma or solid tumors. KPT-350 is an investigational new drug application-ready oral compound with a preclinical data package supporting potential efficacy in a number of neurological,
	autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. We plan to partner with a collaborator to undertake the clinical development and potential commercialization of KPT-350 in one or more mutually agreed indications. We began clinical testing of verdinexor
	(KPT-335) in May 2015 in healthy human volunteers and we are preparing to advance verdinexor for certain viral indications with an initial focus on influenza. Preclinical data provide strong support for other potential indications for verdinexor,

	Summary of Mechanism of Action: Transient XPO1 Inhibition by SINE Compounds

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	One of the ways in which a cell regulates the function of a particular protein is by controlling the protein&#146;s location within the cell,
	as a specific function may only occur within a particular location in the cell. In healthy cells, nuclear transport, both into and out of the nucleus, is a normal and regular occurrence that is tightly regulated and requires specific carrier
	proteins to be present. XPO1 mediates the export of over 220 different mammalian cargo proteins, including the vast majority of tumor suppressor proteins, as well as the transport of certain growth-promoting mRNAs which, when transported into the
	cytoplasm, are translated into functional proteins at high levels. Moreover, XPO1 appears to be the only nuclear exporter for the majority of these tumor suppressor proteins and for particular growth-promoting mRNAs. Cancer cells have increased
	levels of XPO1, causing the increased export of these tumor suppressor proteins from the nucleus. Since the tumor suppressor proteins must be located in the nucleus to promote programmed cell death, or apoptosis, XPO1 overexpression in cancer cells
	counteracts the natural apoptotic process that protects the body from cancer. Due to XPO1 inhibition by our SINE compounds, the export of tumor suppressor proteins is prevented, which leads to their accumulation in the nucleus. This accumulation
	subsequently reinitiates and amplifies their natural apoptotic function in cancer cells with minimal effects on normal cells. Further, SINE compounds reduce the translation of certain growth-promoting proteins (including some cancer-causing
	proteins) by inhibiting the XPO1-mediated transport of their mRNAs to the cytoplasm. The figure below depicts the process by which our SINE compounds inhibit the XPO1 nuclear export of tumor suppressor proteins.

	We believe that the XPO1-inhibiting SINE compounds that we have discovered and developed to date, including
	selinexor, have the potential to provide a novel, oral, targeted therapy that enables tumor suppressor proteins to remain in the nucleus and promote the apoptosis of potentially any type of cancer cell. Moreover, our SINE compounds spare normal
	cells, which, unlike cancer cells, do not have significant damage to their genetic material, and we believe this selectivity for cancer cells minimizes side effects. We believe that the novel mechanism of action and oral administration of selinexor
	and the lack of cumulative or major organ toxicities observed to date in patients treated with selinexor in clinical trials create the potential for selinexor&#146;s broad use across many cancer types, including both hematological and solid tumor
	malignancies. Patient tumor biopsies have confirmed that selinexor treatment induces the nuclear localization of tumor suppressor proteins as well as cancer cell death, or apoptosis, in multiple different cancer types. We believe that no currently

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A human cell is divided into various compartments, including the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The nucleus contains a cell&#146;s genetic
	material, or DNA, and is the compartment where gene expression and consequently cellular function is regulated. The cytoplasm is the compartment around the nucleus where translation of gene transcripts, or mRNA, to proteins, assembly of proteins
	into cellular structural elements, and cellular metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins, occur. One of the ways in which the cell regulates the function of a particular protein is by controlling the protein&#146;s location within the cell,
	as a specific function may only occur within a particular location. Certain proteins, including tumor suppressor proteins and other growth regulatory proteins, need to be transported from the cytoplasm, where they are made, into the nucleus where
	they need to be located for their primary functions to occur. The nuclear pore is a complex gate between the nucleus and cytoplasm, closely regulating the import and export of most large molecules, called macromolecules, including many proteins,
	into and out of the nucleus. In healthy cells, nuclear transport processes of macromolecules in either direction through the nuclear pore is tightly regulated and requires specific carrier proteins, including nuclear export proteins, to occur. There
	are eight known nuclear export proteins. The most well-characterized was discovered in 1999 and is called Exportin 1, or XPO1 (also called CRM1). XPO1 mediates the export of over 220 different mammalian cargo proteins, including some growth
	regulatory proteins and the vast majority of tumor suppressor proteins. Moreover, XPO1 appears to be the only nuclear exporter for the majority of these tumor suppressor proteins, including those generally referred to as p53, p73, FOXO, pRB, BRCA1,
	BRCA2, NPM1, IkB and PP2A.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cancer is a disease characterized by unregulated cell growth. Cancer typically develops when DNA in normal
	cells begins to accumulate mutations or other abnormalities, causing genes that regulate cell growth to become disrupted. Tumor suppressor proteins are an integral part of the body&#146;s natural defense mechanism to identify and prevent cancer.
	When DNA damage is detected, tumor suppressor proteins promote apoptosis. Tumor suppressor proteins can also have an anti-cancer effect by dampening unregulated cell growth and division. Because tumor suppressor proteins need to be located in the
	nucleus in order to carry out their anti-cancer activities, their nuclear export, or exit from the nucleus, leads to their being unavailable in the nucleus to identify cancer cells and initiate their death. As XPO1 levels have been shown to be
	elevated by two- to four-fold in nearly all cancer cells compared to their normal cell counterparts, it appears that cancer cells have co-opted XPO1 to move tumor suppressor proteins out of the nucleus, thereby adversely affecting their ability to
	identify and initiate the death of cancer cells. Increased levels of XPO1 in cancer cells also lead to excessive nuclear export of growth regulatory proteins as well as oncoprotein mRNAs. All of these XPO1 effects allow cancer cells to divide
	continuously and inappropriately. Higher levels of XPO1 expression are also generally correlated with poor prognosis and/or resistance to chemotherapies.

	In addition to transporting tumor suppressor proteins, XPO1 is the sole transporter of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) protein,
	also called the &#147;mRNA cap binding protein.&#148; eIF4E carries the mRNAs for many growth promoting proteins, including certain growth-promoting oncoproteins such as c-myc, Pim1, Atk1, hDM2 and cyclin D from the nucleus into the cytoplasm
	(dependent on XPO1) followed by association with ribosomes for translation into proteins. Blockade of XPO1 leads to accumulation of eIF4E in the cell nucleus and concomitant nuclear trapping of bound growth-promoting mRNAs, leading to reduced
	translation of these mRNAs, and reductions in their protein levels.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since the discovery of XPO1, a growing body of research has documented that the high levels of XPO1 found in cancer cells are associated with
	the transport of tumor suppressor and other growth regulatory proteins from their site of action in the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where their anti-cancer activity is minimal. The inhibition of XPO1 cargo binding has been studied for over ten
	years. XPO1 inhibitors block the nuclear export of tumor suppressor and other cargo proteins, leading to accumulation of these proteins in the nucleus and enhancing their anti-cancer activity in the cell. The forced nuclear retention of these
	proteins can counteract a multitude of the oncogenic pathways that allow cancer cells with severe DNA damage to continue to grow and divide in an unrestrained fashion. XPO1 inhibitors also force the nuclear retention of eIF4E and its cargo
	growth-promoting protein mRNAs, preventing their transport to the cytoplasm for ribosomal translation, leading to reduced levels of oncoproteins. One naturally occurring XPO1 inhibitor called leptomycin B, which must be given intravenously, has been
	shown to have potent anti-cancer activity
<I>
	in vitro

	, but is toxic to normal cells. These toxicities to normal cells have been observed in both animals and humans, which we believe are most likely caused by the

	nature of
	leptomycin B binding to XPO1. Because of its observed toxicities in animals and humans, to our knowledge, leptomycin B is no longer being developed.

	The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives
	treatment with a combination of these methods. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective in patients in whom the disease is localized. Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations in which the cancer has spread
	beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. An early approach to cancer treatment was to develop drugs, referred to as
	cytotoxic drugs, that kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells through non-specific mechanisms, such as disrupting cell metabolism or causing damage to cellular components required for survival and rapid growth. While these drugs have been effective
	in the treatment of some cancers, they act in an indiscriminate manner, killing healthy cells, as well as cancer cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow dose range above which the toxicity causes unacceptable or
	even fatal levels of damage and below which the drugs are not effective in promoting cancer cell death. A different approach to pharmacological cancer treatment has been to develop drugs, referred to as targeted therapeutics, that target specific
	biological molecules in the human body that play a role in rapid cell growth and the spread of cancer. Targeted therapeutics are designed to specifically enable the death of cancer cells and spare normal cells, to improve efficacy, and to minimize
	side effects. The drugs are designed to either attack a target that causes uncontrolled growth of cancer cells because of either a specific genetic alteration primarily found in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, or a target that cancer cells
	are more dependent on for their growth in comparison to normal cells.

	Our SINE compounds are novel therapies specifically designed to
	force nuclear localization and elevation in the levels of multiple tumor suppressor and growth regulatory proteins. Tumor suppressor proteins assess a cell&#146;s DNA and in cells, like most cancer cells, with heavily damaged DNA, these proteins
	induce cell death, or apoptosis. Unlike many other targeted therapeutic approaches which only work for a specific set of cancers or in a specific sub-group of patients, we believe that by restoring tumor suppressor proteins to the nucleus where they
	can assess a cell&#146;s DNA, our SINE compounds have the potential to provide therapeutic benefits across a broad range of both hematological and solid tumor malignancies and benefit a wide range of patients. Additionally, and further supported by
	its mechanism of action and supported by preclinical and clinical data, we believe that selinexor has the potential to be additive or synergistic with approved and experimental therapies in treating many of these cancer patients. As a result, we
	believe that selinexor has the potential to serve as a backbone therapy across multiple hematological and solid tumor malignancies as part of a variety of combination therapies.

	We have determined that the recommended Phase 2 dose of selinexor in most settings is 60mg dosed twice weekly. In December 2015, we and our
	collaborators presented an analysis of our Phase 1 clinical data in hematological malignancies at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting. The analysis demonstrated that doses of selinexor from 45-65mg (median 60mg) were better
	tolerated than doses greater than 65mg and showed less weight loss, lower incidence of high grade adverse events and greater numbers of days on study.&nbsp;266 heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, or MM, non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma, or
	NHL, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and other hematological malignancies were included in the analysis and divided into three groups of evaluable patients: those that received 4-44mg (median 30mg), those that received 45-65mg (median 60mg) and
	those that received greater than 65mg (70-160mg; median 90mg) for comparison of safety and efficacy endpoints. Patients in the 4-44mg and 45-65mg groups remained on study longer than those receiving greater than 65mg, with average treatment duration
	of 120 days in the first two groups versus 90 days in the highest dose group, respectively. Overall efficacy was numerically superior in the 45-65mg dose group across multiple hematologic indications. The most common adverse events, or AEs, were
	nausea (63%), fatigue (62%), anorexia (57%), vomiting (38%), which were mostly grade 1/2, and thrombocytopenia (41%), which was mostly grade 3/4, but with very low incidents of bleeding. The incidence of certain selinexor-related high grade
	(3/4)&nbsp;AEs was lower in patients receiving 45-65mg selinexor as compared to those receiving greater than 65mg. These data from our extensive Phase 1 experience with selinexor are consistent with our belief that a flat dose of 60mg is the most
	appropriate selinexor dose for both efficacy and tolerability in most settings. However, as is the case for many other anti-cancer drugs, certain indications would likely be treated with different doses.

	, study is a single-arm study evaluating the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM with 80mg of selinexor and 20mg of dexamethasone,
	each dosed twice weekly. This 40mg&nbsp;per week dose of dexamethasone is considered &#147;low dose&#148; in the treatment of MM, compared with the &#147;high dose&#148; dexamethasone which uses three times more of the steroid. Under the latest
	protocol version, we are enrolling patients to STORM who (i)&nbsp;have been exposed to bortezomib and carfilzomib, each of which is a PI, and lenalidomide and pomalidomide, each of which is an immunomodulatory agent, or IMiD, and (ii)&nbsp;has
	disease refractory to at least one PI and one IMiD. Prior treatment regimens must have also included an alkylating agent, such as melphalan and/or cyclophosphamide, and a glucocorticoid, such as dexamethasone.

	In November 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved daratumumab (Darzalex&#153;), an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody to
	treat patients with MM who received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an IMiD or whose disease is double refractory to a PI and an IMiD. As a result, we are seeking to increase the proportion of patients enrolling on the
	STORM study whose disease is also refractory to an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody like daratumumab. Patients enrolled under all protocol versions are evaluable for efficacy and will be included in the evaluation of the first cohort of 80 patients on
	the STORM study.

	The primary endpoint of the STORM study is overall response rate, or ORR, meaning partial response, or PR, or better.
	The trial has several secondary endpoints, including ORR in patients whose disease is relapsed/refractory to an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody and duration of response, or DOR. We expect data from the first 80 patients on the STORM study to be
	available in the middle of 2016, at which point we will evaluate whether to expand the study to an additional cohort of patients and whether such expansion, together with promising data, could potentially serve as the basis for an application

	refractory MM who are refractory to an IMiD. We will evaluate 60mg of selinexor twice weekly in combination with low-dose dex and carfilzomib compared to a control therapy of carfilzomib and low-dose dex in this patient population. We expect to dose
	selinexor twice weekly at 60mg during the first three weeks of each four-week cycle. Based on tolerability, the selinexor dose may be increased to 80mg on the same dosing schedule following at least one cycle at 60mg. Carfilzomib is expected to be
	administered intravenously twice weekly for the first three weeks of each four-week cycle and then twice every other week beginning on cycle 14 and successive cycles thereafter. Dexamethasone is expected to be dosed at 20mg twice weekly with
	patients having partial intolerance to glucocorticoids permitted to receive a reduced dose of 10mg twice weekly. We expect that patients who progress on the control arm of the SCORE study will be permitted to crossover to receive the selinexor,
	carfilzomib and low-dose dex regimen. Approximately 84 patients are expected to be enrolled in the Phase&nbsp;2 portion of the SCORE study, which will have a primary endpoint of ORR. The primary endpoint of the Phase&nbsp;3 portion of the study is
	to compare progression free survival, or PFS, in patients treated with selinexor, carfilzomib and low-dose dex versus patients treated with placebo, carfilzomib and low-dose dex. We expect top-line data from the Phase 2 portion of this study in the

	were not well tolerated. While the recommended phase 2 dose of selinexor in most settings is 60mg twice weekly, the addition of a
	steroid like dexamethasone in the multiple myeloma setting allows for higher dosing of selinexor. Additionally, this dose of dexamethasone is the standard low-dose dexamethasone (40mg weekly or 20mg twice weekly) used with nearly all other
	anti-myeloma drugs. The patients enrolled in this study had received a median of seven prior lines of therapy, each line typically consisting of two to four separate anti-myeloma agents. All had received prior therapy with at least one PI, such as
	carfilzomib or bortezomib, and at least one IMiD, such as lenalidomide or pomalidomide, and steroids (typically two or more times).

	As of
	December&nbsp;6, 2015, the best responses among the 12 evaluable patients were one stringent complete response, or sCR (8%), seven PRs&nbsp;(58%), two MRs&nbsp;(17%) and two PD&nbsp;(17%). Two patients left the trial before disease assessment and
	were therefore not evaluable for response. The clinical benefit rate (sCR+PRs+MRs) was 83% and the ORR (sCR+PRs) was 67%. The median duration of response is approximately seven months and the longest response lasted over one year. AEs in patients
	receiving single-agent selinexor were generally low-grade, consistent with events observed in patients with other hematological malignancies and responsive to standard supportive care. Compared with selinexor given alone, fewer AEs in patients
	receiving selinexor in combination with low-dose dexamethasone were reported, particularly levels of nausea, vomiting and weight loss. These observations are consistent with dexamethasone&#146;s expected reduction in nausea, anorexia and fatigue,

	AML in elderly populations remains a vexing clinical problem with little progress in the last decade. There are no treatment agents
	specifically approved for this population in the United States. AML is a cancer that starts in the bone marrow and in most cases quickly moves into the blood. The incidence of AML dramatically increases after the age of 55. The American Cancer
	Society estimates that approximately 20,000 new cases of AML, most of which will be in adults, will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016, with approximately 10,400&nbsp;deaths from AML in the United States in 2016. Approximately 40% of AML
	patients are young enough with sufficient major organ function to undergo stem cell transplantation for their AML, and approximately 50% of these patients can be cured of their disease. Therefore, approximately 20% of adults with AML are currently
	curable. Those who are not cured, and those patients who are elderly or unfit for transplant, have a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than one year. Moreover, prognosis worsens continuously with advancing age to a median survival
	of as low as one month for those who are older than 85 years of age.

	Over the past two decades, many compounds have been evaluated in

	anthracyclines and cytosine arabinoside, or Ara-C (often referred to as the &#147;7+3&#148; regimen), are usually treated with best supportive care, or BSC, including blood transfusions, antibiotics and hydroxyurea if indicated, along with

	Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, or DLBCL, is the most common of the aggressive NHLs. We estimate that approximately 22,000 patients are
	diagnosed with DLBCL in the United States each year, with approximately 10,000 deaths per year. The fundamental treatment of DLBCL has changed little in the past two decades, with no new or targeted agents approved for this indication. Initial
	therapy with multi-agent cytotoxic drugs in combination with the monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan

	), most often in a combination therapy known as &#147;R-CHOP,&#148; leads to cures in
	approximately 50% of patients. Patients who are not cured with initial immune-chemotherapy have a poor prognosis. Of the approximately 30% of patients who are less than 65&nbsp;years old and have good organ function, high dose chemotherapy with stem
	cell transplantation can lead to cures in up to half. Older patients relapsing after initial chemotherapy, and those relapsing after stem cell transplantation, have a very poor prognosis, and the expected survival of such patients is less than one
	year. Newer targeted agents such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib (Imbruvica

	have shown some activity in the immunoblastic (activated B-cell or ABC) type of DLBCL in clinical trials, but responses are generally short. Responses to these newer agents are much lower in the germinal center, or GCB, type of DLBCL. Therefore,
	with 10,000 deaths in United States each year due to DLBCL, we believe that novel, well-tolerated drugs are needed for the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL.

	As of June&nbsp;1, 2015, 77 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed and/or refractory NHL were enrolled in our Phase 1 clinical trial for
	selinexor. Of this group, 67 patients were evaluable for response. The DCR was 67% across all doses of selinexor and the ORR was 33%. Responses were observed across all subtypes of NHL, independent of genetic abnormalities, with durable cancer
	control observed across several patients who remained on study for longer than nine months, with the longest remaining on study for over 24 months.

	Among the 41 patients with heavily pretreated DLBCL who were evaluable as of June&nbsp;1, 2015, ORR and DCR were similar across the two major
	subtypes of DLBCL, namely GCB and ABC, also called non-GCB. Many targeted therapies such as ibrutinib or lenalidomide show activity primarily against the ABC subtype (although all patients relapse), but there are no viable treatment options for
	patients with relapsed/refractory GCB. However, consistent with the broadly applicable mechanism of action of selinexor, selinexor showed activity across both major subtypes of DLBCL with DCR equal to 60% and 40% between the GCB and non-GCB
	subtypes, respectively, and ORR equal to 35% and 20% between the GCB and non-GCB subtypes, respectively.

	In addition, a minority of DLBCL
	patients have &#147;double-hit&#148; disease because these tumors over-express the two oncogenes MYC and BCL2 (or BCL6). Double-hit DLBCL is particularly difficult to treat due in part to its resistance to multi-agent immunochemotherapy and many
	targeted agents. Essentially all patients with double-hit DLBCL will relapse after initial therapy, or have tumors that fail to respond (i.e., are refractory) to initial and subsequent therapies. Of five patients with double-hit DLBCL as of
	June&nbsp;1, 2015, there was one patient with a CR (on study 589 days), two patients with PRs, one on study for 214 days and the other on study for 91 days before going to transplant, and two patients who progressed. We believe that these data and
	the consistent data across DLBCL subtypes indicate that selinexor has the potential to treat a broad range of subtypes of DLBCL, largely independent of the cell of origin or oncogenic drivers.

	KPT-8602 is a second generation SINE compound that, like selinexor, selectively blocks the nuclear export protein XPO1. Most of the key tumor
	suppressor proteins, or TSPs, are cargos of XPO1 and inhibition of XPO1 by KPT-8602 sequesters TSPs in the nucleus where they can carry out their normal functions. As KPT-8602 acts through induction of TSPs, it is selectively cytotoxic for cells

	vitro and in vivo. KPT-8602 and other SINE compounds are not intrinsically cytotoxic. Rather, they can restore the highly effective tumor suppressing pathways that lead to selective elimination
	of genomically damaged, or neoplastic, cells. Cancer cells with damaged genomes are induced to undergo apoptosis. Normal cells, with an intact genome, remain in a transient, reversible cell cycle arrest until the export block is relieved. Tumors of
	hematopoietic lineage are particularly susceptible to apoptosis induction by XPO1 inhibition; normal hematopoietic cells and their functions are largely spared.

	In preclinical models, KPT-8602 has a broad therapeutic window with minimal penetration of the blood brain barrier and, therefore, has the
	potential to serve as a second generation SINE compound for cancer indications. Following oral administration, animals treated with KPT-8602 show lower percentage of body weight loss and improved food consumption than animals similarly treated with
	selinexor. This allows more frequent dosing of KPT-8602, enabling a longer period of exposure at higher levels than is possible with selinexor. As a result, we believe that KPT-8602 represents a second generation SINE compound and are evaluating
	safety, tolerability and efficacy in humans.

	In addition to our SINE compounds, we also investigate XPO1 cargo proteins and their role in the cell cycle and cell division. As part
	of this investigation, we have identified several XPO1 cargo proteins whose inhibition leads to the selective death of cancer cells. One of the XPO1 cargo proteins that we identified was p21-activated kinase 4, or PAK4. PAK4 is member of the PAK
	family of kinases that includes 6 proteins, PAK1-6. PAK4-6 belong to a growth-promoting sub-family. PAK4 is a signaling protein regulating numerous fundamental cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cellular division, cell shape and
	motility, cell survival, immune defense and the development of cancer. PAK4 interacts with many key signaling molecules involved in cancer such as beta-catenin, CDC42, Raf-1, BAD and myosin light chain. Based on this biology, we used our drug
	discovery and optimization expertise to identify small molecule modulators of PAK4. Our PAK4 allosteric modulators have shown broad evidence of anti-cancer activity against hematological and solid tumor malignant cells while showing minimal toxicity
	to normal cells in vitro. In mouse and rat xenograft studies, our PAK4 inhibitors given orally have shown evidence of anti-cancer activity and tolerability. To our knowledge, we are the only company with a pre-IND allosteric, PAK4 specific
	inhibitor.

	Recently, we identified an additional target for our clinical candidate KPT-9274 known as NAMPT (Nicotinamide
	phosphoribosyltransferase; also known as PBEF or Visfatin). NAMPT is a pleiotropic protein with intra- and extra-cellular functions as an enzyme, cytokine, growth factor, and hormone that can be found in complex with PAK4 in the cell. NAMPT is of
	interest as an oncology target because it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in one of the two intracellular salvage pathways that generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD. NAD is a universal energy- and signal-carrying molecule involved in
	mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, antioxidation, and paradoxically generation of oxidative stress, gene expression, immunological functions, aging, and cell death.

	KPT-9274 is a first-in-class orally bioavailable small molecule that is a non-competitive dual modulator of PAK4 and NAMPT. Co-inhibition of
	these targets leads to synergistic anti-tumor effects through energy depletion, inhibition of DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, inhibition of proliferation, and ultimately apoptosis. Normal cells are more resistant to inhibition by KPT-9274 due in part
	to their relative genomic stability and lower metabolic rates. Hematologic and solid tumor cells become dependent on both PAK4 and NAMPT pathways and are therefore susceptible to single-agent cytotoxicity by KPT-9274. We are planning to develop

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have used spontaneously occurring canine cancers as a surrogate model for human malignancies. It is widely known that canine lymphomas
	display a comparable genetic profile and respond to chemotherapy in a fashion similar to their human counterparts (human NHL, most closely DLBCL). Lymphomas are one of the most common tumors in pet dogs. Lymphoma in dogs is very aggressive and,
	without treatment, the tumors are often fatal within weeks. The majority of dog lymphomas are DLBCL and most of the others are T-cell lymphomas. Given the similarities of dog and human lymphomas, prior to initiating clinical trials of selinexor in
	humans, we investigated verdinexor (KPT-335), a closely-related, orally available SINE compound in pet dogs with lymphomas. We have received a Minor Use / Minor Species, or MUMS, designation from the FDA&#146;s Center for Veterinary Medicine, or
	CVM, for the treatment of newly-diagnosed or first relapse after chemotherapy lymphomas in pet dogs with verdinexor.

	Several different

	did not change significantly in dogs treated with verdinexor. Based on these findings, a Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial, intended to support regulatory approval under the MUMS designation in the United States, was performed in 58 pet dogs with either

	KPT-350 is an IND-ready oral SINE compound with a preclinical data package supporting potential efficacy across a number of neurological,
	autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. XPO1 mediates the nuclear export of multiple proteins that impact neurological, autoimmune and inflammatory processes. Consequently, inhibition of XPO1 by KPT-350 results in a reduction in autoimmunity and
	inflammation and an increase in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. KPT-350 penetrates the blood brain barrier, or BBB, to a greater degree than other SINE compounds. Preclinical data generated largely by external collaborators show
	efficacy of orally-administered KPT-350 and related SINE compounds in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS; traumatic brain injury, or TBI; multiple sclerosis, or MS; systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus; and rheumatoid
	arthritis, or RA.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The ability of KPT-350 to affect TBI outcome was evaluated in three different rat models of TBI that are designed to
	mimic the heterogeneity of TBI observed in clinical practice: unilateral cortical injury, bilateral cortical injury, and fluid percussion injury models. In these studies, KPT-350 was administered orally with various dosing regimens from two to 72
	hours post-injury. Efficacy was observed in each of the models, involving amelioration of TBI-induced cognitive and motor deficits. This functional activity was accompanied by KPT-350-mediated reduction of TBI lesion size, enhanced neuronal survival
	and suppression of inflammatory markers. We believe this indicates KPT-350 exerted a neuroprotective effect to prevent permanent neuronal loss due to the blunt force injury and subsequent inflammatory and neurotoxic effects. KPT-350 was effective
	even when treatment was initiated at 72 hours post injury. KPT-350 was also found to ameliorate BBB leakage associated with TBI, which has anti-inflammatory consequences independent of the other mechanisms of

	prevented neurite beading, an overall indicator of neuronal dysfunction. KPT-350 treatment also reversed hind-limb paralysis and spinal cord inflammatory lesions in a murine EAE model of MS. We also tested KPT-350 in a TDP-43 adeno-associated virus

	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries,
	including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for
	administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug may also be eligible for patent term extension when
	FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. See &#147;&#151;Government Regulation&#151;Patent Term Restoration and Extension&#148; below for additional information on such extensions. In the future, if and when
	our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug candidate and
	other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.

	As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property
	position for our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in
	the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Our issued patents and any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For
	example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to
	participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development
	and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby
	reducing any advantage of any such patent.

	In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing

	invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators requiring assignment of inventions. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary

	The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis
	on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical,
	specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing
	therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

	There are several companies developing or marketing treatments for
	cancer and the other indications on which we currently plan to focus, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. To our knowledge, no other company has an XPO1 inhibitor has enrolled patients in clinical trials at the present
	time. However, Stemline Therapeutics, Inc. announced in January 2015 that it had exclusively licensed the rights to develop and commercialize SL-801, an oral XPO1 inhibitor, from CanBas&nbsp;Co.,&nbsp;Ltd. In December 2015, Stemline announced the
	opening of its investigational new drug, or IND, application and planned initiation of a clinical development program in multiple cancer types.

	Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial
	resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and
	biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements
	with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in
	acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.

	The key competitive factors affecting the success of
	all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the availability of generic chemotherapy and other cancer therapies and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party
	payors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more
	effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain
	approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking
	to encourage the use of generic drugs. Generic drugs for the treatment of cancer and the other indications on which we currently plan to initially focus are currently on the market, and additional drugs are expected to become available on a generic
	basis over the coming years. If we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over generic versions of older chemotherapy agents and other cancer therapies.

	The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug
	therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our drug candidates may compete with many existing drugs and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination
	with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our drug candidates will be complimentary with them. Some of the currently-approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these

	An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical
	trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a
	request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing
	information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before
	clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA
	may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can

	and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health,
	or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the

	NDAs is subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3&nbsp;million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per
	establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small
	businesses, an exception from the establishment fee when the establishment does not engage in manufacturing the drug during a particular fiscal year, and an exception from the product fee for a drug that is the same as another drug approved under an
	abbreviated pathway.

	day after FDA&#146;s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The
	FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before FDA accepts it for filing.
	Once the submission is accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular
	Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for &#147;priority review&#148; are meant to be reviewed within six
	months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal
	date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.

	Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the
	product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing,
	and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product

	In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the

	benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare
	professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of
	patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a

	Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other
	drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with
	the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#146;s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the
	sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time

	Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a
	serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available
	therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance
	that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten

	Accelerated Approval Pathway
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to
	patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product
	has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other
	clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness
	as those granted traditional approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory
	measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical
	endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals
	based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if
	there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate
	clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity
	and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional
	post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug&#146;s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or
	post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on
	an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

	In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register

	often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers
	that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

	applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#146;s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether
	or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application &#147;were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the

	previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA&#146;s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the
	new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the

	and extent of absorption of the listed drug.&#148; Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is &#147;therapeutically equivalent&#148; to the RLD in its publication &#147;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic
	Equivalence Evaluations,&#148; also referred to as the &#147;Orange Book.&#148; Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and
	numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#146;s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.

	Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has
	expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has
	previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be
	filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph&nbsp;IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also
	provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the

	A patent claiming a new drug product or its method of use may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term
	restoration, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose
	active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA
	and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14&nbsp;years from the product&#146;s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for
	the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals.
	The United States PTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.

	the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#146;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within

	Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may designate a drug product as an &#147;orphan drug&#148; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or
	condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for
	treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a NDA. If the request is granted, FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its
	potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

	If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select
	indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that FDA may not approve any other applications for the same
	product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same
	product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to

	be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of
	operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a drug
	product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.

	The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign
	governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of
	generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company&#146;s revenue generated from the sale of any
	approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing
	approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

	Outside the United States, ensuring
	adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt
	of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in
	commercialization.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide
	that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so
	called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems
	provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the
	company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in
	the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by
	many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political,
	economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e.,
	arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and
	pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.

	selinexor. Our ability to generate revenues from the sale of drugs that treat cancer and other diseases in humans, which we do not expect to occur for several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and

	groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for selinexor in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval
	contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development, marketing and/or commercialization of selinexor or any other drug candidate that we may discover,
	in-license, develop or acquire in the future. Furthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for selinexor, we will still need to develop a commercial organization, or collaborate with a third party for the commercialization of selinexor,
	establish commercially viable pricing and obtain approval for adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payors. If we or our commercialization collaborators are unable to successfully commercialize selinexor, we may not be able to

	To date, we have had limited discussions with the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities regarding the design of our later phase clinical
	trials for selinexor, of which we have commenced five such clinical trials. We plan to seek regulatory approvals of selinexor in North America and Europe in each indication with respect to which such later phase clinical trial is being conducted and
	with respect to which we receive positive results that may support full or accelerated approval, as the case may be. We may also seek such approvals in other geographies. We cannot be certain that we will commence additional later phase trials or
	complete ongoing later phase trials as anticipated. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any drug candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical studies and
	well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the drug candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication. There is no assurance that the FDA or non-U.S.
	regulatory authorities would consider our current and planned later phase clinical trials to be sufficient to serve as the basis for filing for approval or to gain approval of selinexor for any indication. The FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities
	retain broad discretion in evaluating the results of our clinical trials and in determining whether the results demonstrate that selinexor is safe and effective. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials of selinexor prior to
	approval, including additional earlier phase clinical trials that may be required prior to commencing any later phase clinical trials, or additional clinical trials following completion of our current and planned later phase clinical trials, we will
	need substantial additional funds and there is no assurance that the results of any such additional clinical trials will be sufficient for approval.

	selinexor in patients over 60&nbsp;years of age with relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first relapse, who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy or
	transplantation, is overall survival. Similarly, the primary endpoint of our SEAL study, the clinical trial of selinexor in patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma, is progression free survival. We are in the early stages of collecting clinical
	data in humans relating to the impact of selinexor on overall survival and comparative clinical data between selinexor and supportive care. If selinexor does not demonstrate an overall survival benefit, it will likely not be approved. In some
	instances, the FDA and other regulatory bodies have accepted overall response rate as a surrogate for a clinical benefit, and have granted regulatory approvals based on this or other surrogate endpoints. Overall response rate is defined as the
	portion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount for a minimum time period. For some types of cancer, we may use overall response rate as a primary endpoint, as we are doing in our Selinexor Against Diffuse Aggressive Lymphoma
	(SADAL) study; our Selinexor In Initial or Relapsed/Refractory Richter&#146;s Transformation (SIRRT) study and our Selinexor Treatment Of Refractory Myeloma (STORM) study. These clinical trials will not be randomized against control arms and the
	primary endpoints of these trials are overall response rate. If selinexor does not demonstrate sufficient overall response rates in these indications, or any other indication for which a clinical trial has overall response rate as a primary
	endpoint, or if the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities do not deem overall response rate a sufficient endpoint, it will likely not be approved for that indication.

	Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing
	regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product candidate to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over available therapies, upon a determination that the product has an effect on
	a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA considers a clinical benefit to be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease,
	such as irreversible morbidity or mortality. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical
	benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on
	irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug. The accelerated approval pathway may be used in cases in which the
	advantage of a new drug over available therapy may not be a direct therapeutic advantage, but is a clinically important improvement from a patient and public health perspective.

	Prior to seeking such accelerated approval, we will seek feedback from the FDA and will otherwise evaluate our ability to seek and receive
	such accelerated approval. There can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our surrogate endpoints or intermediate clinical endpoints. There can also be no assurance that we will decide to pursue or submit an NDA for accelerated approval or
	any other form of expedited development, review or approval. Similarly, there can be no assurance that, after feedback from FDA, we will continue to pursue or apply for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or
	approval, even if we initially decide to do so. Furthermore, if we decide to submit an application for accelerated approval or under another expedited regulatory designation, there can be no assurance that such submission or application will be

	Moreover, for drugs granted
	accelerated approval, the FDA typically requires post-marketing confirmatory trials to evaluate the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence.
	The FDA may withdraw approval of our product candidate approved under the accelerated approval pathway if, for example, the trial required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of our product candidate fails to verify such benefit or does not
	demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. The FDA may also withdraw approval if other evidence demonstrates that our product candidate is not shown to be safe or effective under the conditions of use, we
	fail to conduct any required post approval trial of our product candidate with due diligence, or we disseminate false or misleading promotional materials relating to our product candidate. A failure to obtain accelerated approval or any other form
	of expedited development, review or approval for our product candidates, or withdrawal of a product candidate, would result in a longer time period for commercialization of such product candidate, could increase the cost of development of such

	drug candidates targeting the regulation of intracellular transport of XPO1 have commercial value or experiences significant delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to continue

	Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our drug candidates, we must complete preclinical development
	and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A
	failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do
	not necessarily predict final results. For example, the results of our Phase&nbsp;1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of selinexor to date are based on unaudited data provided by our clinical trial investigators. An audit of this data may change the
	conclusions drawn from this unaudited data provided by our clinical trial investigators indicating less promising results than we currently anticipate. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and

	The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. In the United
	States, recently enacted legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be
	marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or drug licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial
	approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a drug in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the drug, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact
	the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the drug in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more drug candidates, even if our drug candidates obtain marketing approval.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our ability to commercialize any drugs successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these drugs and related
	treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations,
	decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the healthcare industry in the United States and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control
	costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices
	charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any drug that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, we cannot be sure as to the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for,
	or the price of, any drug candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any drug candidate for which we obtain marketing
	approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly-approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the
	purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs,
	including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to
	the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by
	mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United
	States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private
	payors for any approved drugs that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize drugs and our overall financial condition.

	As part of the drug discovery and
	development process, we have used spontaneously occurring pet dog cancers as a surrogate model for human malignancies. Dog lymphomas respond to chemotherapy in a manner similar to their human counterparts (human non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphomas) and
	display a comparable genetic profile. The anti-cancer activity of our drug candidate verdinexor (KPT-335) in a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial in dogs with certain lymphomas provided support for our decision to move selinexor, our closely-related human
	drug candidate, into Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trials. We conducted a Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of verdinexor in dogs with newly-diagnosed or first time relapse lymphomas. We have received a Minor Use / Minor Species, or MUMS, designation from the
	Center for Veterinary Medicine of the FDA for the treatment of newly-diagnosed or after first relapse lymphomas in dogs with verdinexor. Our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial was intended to support regulatory approval under the MUMS designation. We
	submitted and the FDA accepted the safety and effectiveness sections of a NADA for verdinexor. If verdinexor fails to shows adequate safety or efficacy or is not otherwise viewed positively or if verdinexor is not otherwise approved by the FDA for
	the treatment of lymphomas in dogs, this may raise questions regarding selinexor because we have used dog cancers as a surrogate model for human malignancies. In such an event, verdinexor&#146;s clinical trial results may cause the FDA or non-U.S.
	regulatory authorities to require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data to support approval of selinexor. If the results of the Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of verdinexor fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the
	satisfaction of the FDA or are not otherwise viewed positively, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of verdinexor. In such an event, we also may
	not be able to realize our potential to generate revenue from the commercialization of verdinexor, either on our own or with a collaborator.

	To become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize a drug or drugs with significant market
	potential, either on our own or with a collaborator. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of our drug candidates, obtaining marketing approval for
	these drug candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those drugs for which we may obtain marketing approval and establishing and managing any collaborations for the development, marketing and/or commercialization of our drug candidates. We
	may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a
	quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business and/or continue our
	operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.

	We are an early-stage company. We were incorporated in 2008 and commenced operations in 2009. Our operations to date have been limited to
	organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our platform, identifying potential drug candidates and conducting preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials of our drug candidates. Our lead drug
	candidate is currently in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and all of our other drug candidates for the treatment of human disease are in early clinical development or preclinical development. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to
	successfully complete any late-stage clinical trials in humans, including large-scale clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale drug, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and
	marketing activities necessary for successful drug commercialization. Typically, it takes about six to ten years to develop one new drug from the time it is in Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trials to when it is available for treating patients. Consequently,
	any predictions stockholders make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.

	Global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions over some of the past several years, including in

	and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in
	patents being issued which protect our drug candidates or other discoveries, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive drugs and discoveries. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the
	United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.

	The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the
	United States. For example, in some foreign jurisdictions, our ability to secure patents based on our filings in the United States may depend, in part, on our ability to timely obtain assignment of rights to the invention from the employees and
	consultants who invented the technology. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until
	18&nbsp;months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patent or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of
	such inventions.

	held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical discoveries and drugs, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our discoveries and drug candidates. Given the amount of
	time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us

	In order to market and sell our drugs in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we, and any collaborators we may have in the future,
	must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially
	from that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process outside of the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, it is
	required that the drug be approved for reimbursement before the drug can be approved for sale in that country. We, and any collaborators we may have in the future, may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside of the United States on
	a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside of the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory

	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our contract research organizations and other
	third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber attacks, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause

	this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

	Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or
	Section&nbsp;404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we are not required to include an attestation report on internal control
	over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial
	reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control
	over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over
	financial reporting. There is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by
	Section&nbsp;404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, if we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an

	Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our net operating loss and tax
	credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service (and state tax authorities under relevant state tax rules). The use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual
	limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, respectively, and similar state provisions in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders in excess of 50 percent over a three-year period. This
	could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of a company immediately prior to the ownership change.
	Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. Our company has completed several financings since its inception that may have resulted in ownership changes under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In addition, future
	changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in ownership changes in the future. For these reasons, we may not be able to use some or all of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, even if we
	attain profitability prior to the expiration of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

	On November&nbsp;12, 2013, we issued and sold 6,800,000 shares of our common stock in the IPO at a public offering price of
	$16.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $108.8 million. On December&nbsp;10, 2013, we issued and sold 1,020,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the underwriters&#146; full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares in
	the IPO at $16.00 per share for gross proceeds of $16.3 million. All of the shares issued and sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form&nbsp;S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-191584), which was
	declared effective by the SEC on November&nbsp;5, 2013, and a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-192110) filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated and Leerink
	Swann LLC acted as joint-book-running managers of the offering and as representatives of the underwriters. JMP Securities LLC and Oppenheimer&nbsp;&amp; Co. Inc. acted as co-managers for the offering. The offering commenced on November&nbsp;5, 2013

	The net offering proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts of $8.8
	million and offering expenses payable by us totaling $3.2 million, were approximately $113.2 million. No offering expenses or net offering proceeds were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates) or persons
	owning 10.0% or more of any class of our equity securities or to any other affiliates.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have used all of
	such net offering proceeds to fund the continued clinical development of our lead drug candidate, selinexor, the preclinical development of our drug candidates for anti-inflammatory, viral and wound healing indications, the discovery, research and
	preclinical development of additional drug candidates and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We are holding a significant portion of the balance of the net proceeds from the offering in interest-bearing money market accounts,
	prime money market funds and other short-term investments. There has been no material change in our planned use of the balance of the net proceeds from the offering described in the prospectus filed by us with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on

	We are a clinical-stage

	Our initial
	focus is on seeking the regulatory approval and commercialization of our lead drug candidate, selinexor (KPT-330), as an orally administered agent in cancer indications with significant unmet clinical need, initially for hematologic malignancies. We
	then plan to seek additional approvals for the use of selinexor in combination therapies to expand the patient populations that are eligible for selinexor, as well as to move selinexor further towards front-line cancer therapy. We are also advancing
	the clinical development of selinexor in multiple solid tumor indications. To date, we have initiated multiple later-phase clinical trials to evaluate selinexor in hematological cancers and solid tumors. We have also initiated a double-blinded,
	placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2/3 study of single-agent selinexor in liposarcoma and expect to initiate in the middle of 2016 a double-blinded, randomized Phase 2/3 study of selinexor in combination with carfilzomib (Kyprolis

	As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development
	expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been
	invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet
	date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued
	research and development expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts
	with CROs and CMOs that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which
	payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of
	effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepayment accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially
	different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, it could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any
	particular period. Our estimates have not been materially different than amounts actually incurred to date.

	expected term of the option, (c)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate, and (d)&nbsp;expected dividends. Since there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering, we
	lacked company specific historical and implied volatility data. In addition, as a newly public company, we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of the options. Therefore, we base
	our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of representative companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk
	profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected term of the options. We compute the historical volatility data using the closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares
	during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our options. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We estimate
	the expected term of our employee stock options using the &#147;simplified&#148; method pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No.,&nbsp;107
<I>
	Share-based payments
</I>
	, whereby the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the
	original contractual term of the option. For non-employee stock options, we utilize the contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected term of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
	effect during the period the options were granted. We have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero.

	We are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
	differ from estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those options that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates,
	the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on options that ultimately vest.

	In July 2011, we entered into a research agreement with the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, or MMRF, for the research and development of
	small molecule XPO1 inhibitor compounds for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Pursuant to the research agreement, MMRF awarded us a $1.0&nbsp;million grant, all of which has been paid to us based on our achievement of specified milestones. We own

	If we, our affiliates, licensees or transferees commercialize products incorporating a program invention or program intellectual property,
	which we call research program products, we would be obligated to pay to MMRF mid- single-digit royalties as a percentage of worldwide net sales of research program products, including selinexor, sold by us, our affiliates, licensees or transferees.
	If we out-license rights to a research program product, we are obligated to pay MMRF a percentage of certain payments we receive from our licensee for the grant of such rights. If we sell all or substantially all of our assets to one or more third
	parties who were not our stockholders on the effective date of the agreement, or if one or more third parties acquire more than fifty percent of our equity and payments are made directly to our stockholders for the sale of their shares of our stock,
	each of which we call a change of control, we will be obligated to pay to MMRF a percentage of the value we or our shareholders receive in connection with such change of control. The maximum aggregate amount we may be obligated to pay to MMRF for

	sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Due to the short-term maturities of our cash equivalents and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a

	not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given
	the potential instability of financial institutions, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits.

	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as

	to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
	designed under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting
	purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
	the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	Karyopharm Therapeutics&nbsp;Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that seeks to discover,
	develop, and commercialize drugs to treat cancer and certain other major diseases. It was incorporated in Delaware on December&nbsp;22, 2008 and has a principal place of business in Newton, Massachusetts.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company has not generated any revenue related to its primary business purpose to date and is subject to a number of
	risks similar to those of other early stage life science companies, including rapid technology change, regulatory approval of products, uncertainty of market acceptance of products, compliance with government regulations, protection of proprietary
	technology, dependence on key individuals, competition from other companies, the need for development of commercially viable products, and the need to obtain adequate additional financing to fund the development of its product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company has generated an accumulated deficit of $256,527 since inception. The Company has financed its operations primarily through
	private placements of its preferred stock, an initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) completed in November 2013 and two follow-on offerings of common stock as well as a controlled equity offering. The Company has not completed development of any
	product candidate and has devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical and clinical development. The Company expects to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing
	operating losses for at least several years. The Company believes its cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and proceeds from its controlled equity offering commenced in December 2015 will be sufficient to allow the
	Company to fund its current operating plan through at least January&nbsp;1, 2017.

	arrangement consideration contingent upon achievement of a milestone is recognized by the Company in the period the milestone is met when the Company concludes that the milestone is substantive. At the inception of each applicable arrangement, the
	Company assesses each milestone and the consideration payable upon achievement of each milestone and concludes that the milestone is substantive if all of the following criteria are met: (i)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with the
	Company&#146;s performance or the enhanced value of a delivered item which is a direct result of the Company&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (ii)&nbsp;the consideration relates to past performance and there are no refund rights or other
	penalties related to the consideration based on completion of future performance and (iii)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. The related consideration for milestones that
	are considered substantive is recognized in its entirety in the period which the milestone is met.

	based on the difference between the financial reporting and the tax reporting basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The

	In November 2015, the FASB issued authoritative accounting guidance related to the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. This
	guidance requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance may be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for annual reporting
	periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015, and as the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance,
	there was no impact to the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations upon its adoption of this standard.

	The Company reviews investments for other-than-temporary impairment whenever the fair value of an investment is less than the amortized cost
	and evidence indicates that an investment&#146;s carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time. Other-than-temporary impairments of investments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations if the Company has
	experienced a credit loss or has the intent to sell the investment or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the amortized cost basis. Evidence considered in this assessment includes
	reasons for the impairment, compliance with the Company&#146;s investment policy, the severity and the duration of the impairment and changes in value subsequent to the end of the period.

	The Company uses the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
	Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107,
<I>
	Share-Based Payment
</I>
	, to calculate the expected term as it does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term for options granted to
	employees and utilizes the contractual term for options granted to non-employees. The expected term is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as the Company does not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination
	behavior among its employee population. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a representative group of companies with similar characteristics to the Company, including early stage of product development and therapeutic
	focus. For these analyses, the Company selects companies with comparable characteristics to theirs including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected
	term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. Management estimates expected forfeitures based on historical data from the Company and
	recognizes compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the total unrecognized compensation related to unvested employee and non-employee stock option awards granted under

	In 2014 certain individuals changed status from employees to non-employees.&nbsp;The outstanding stock option awards for these individuals

	individuals to accelerate vesting of a stock option award in connection with a separation agreement.&nbsp;The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1,866 associated with these awards.&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, there was no

	The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred
	tax assets. Based on the Company&#146;s history of operating losses, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefit of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation
	allowance for deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. The valuation allowance increased approximately $46,536 and $31,170 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due primarily to the generation of net
	operating losses during the periods then ended.

	Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible
	adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant
	shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50&nbsp;percent, as defined under Sections&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be
	utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the
	limitation in future years. The Company has completed several financings since its inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or could result in a change in control
	in the future.
