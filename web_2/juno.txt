	We are building a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on re-engaging the body&#146;s immune system to revolutionize the treatment of cancer.
	Founded on the vision that the use of human cells as therapeutic entities will drive one of the next important phases in medicine, we are developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on our CAR and high-affinity TCR technologies to genetically
	engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. We have shown compelling clinical responses in clinical trials using multiple cell-based product candidates to address refractory B cell lymphomas and leukemias, and we also have a number of
	ongoing trials exploring our platform in solid-organ cancers and in combination with various strategies to overcome the immune-suppressive effects of cancer. Longer term, we aim to improve and leverage our cell-based platform to develop additional
	product candidates to address a broad range of cancers and human diseases, including moving forward our pre-clinical product candidates that target additional hematologic and solid-organ cancers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the third quarter of 2015, we began a Phase II trial of JCAR015 that could support accelerated U.S. regulatory approval in adult relapsed/refractory
	(&#147;r/r&#148;) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (&#147;ALL&#148;) as early as 2017. We also began a Phase I trial with JCAR017 in adult r/r aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (&#147;NHL&#148;), with the potential to move to a registration
	trial for that product candidate in 2016 or early 2017. We are continuing to enroll patients in an ongoing Phase I/II trial for JCAR014 in B cell malignancies, and although we do not plan to move JCAR014 into registration trials, we plan to use this
	trial to explore important questions that may improve our platform overall. To date, data from the JCAR014 trial have provided encouraging early insights on how to improve our efficacy and safety in patients with ALL, NHL, and chronic lymphocytic
	leukemia (&#147;CLL&#148;). The IND has cleared for and we plan to enroll patients through 2016 in a Phase Ib clinical trial combining JCAR014 with MedImmune&#146;s investigational programmed death ligand 1 (&#147;PD-L1&#148;) immune checkpoint
	inhibitor, durvalumab, for the treatment of adult r/r B cell NHL. We have also begun Phase I trials for five additional product candidates that target different cancer-associated proteins in hematological and solid organ cancers. We also expect to
	commence a Phase I trial through our collaborator MSK of a CD19/4-1BBL &#147;armored&#148; CAR in 2016 and a Phase I trial for one or both of CD19/CD40L and CD19/IL-12 &#147;armored&#148; CARs in 2016 or 2017.

	Cancer is a leading cause of death in developed countries. Cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. Cancer cells contain

	Cancer cells&#146; ability to evade immune surveillance is a key factor in their growth, spread, and persistence. In the last five years, there has been substantial scientific progress in countering these evasion mechanisms using immunotherapies, or

	A central player in cancer immunotherapy is a type of white blood cell known as the T cell. In healthy individuals, T cells identify and kill infected or

	construct into the T cell that enables it to recognize cancer cells. Our CAR technology directs T cells to recognize cancer cells based on the expression of specific proteins located on the cell surface, whereas our TCR technology provides the T

	Researchers have used CAR T cells for more than two decades in the treatment of cancer. A key insight over the past decade was the addition of a costimulatory domain to the construct. The
	costimulatory domain amplifies intracellular signaling after the binding domain interacts with a target protein, magnifying the activation of the T cell. We are advancing two next-generation CAR technologies, which we refer to as bispecific CARs and
	&#147;armored&#148; CARs. Bispecific CARs incorporate a second binding domain on the CAR T cell designed to either amplify or inhibit signaling, a feature that may increase the CAR T cells&#146; ability to distinguish between cancer cells and normal
	cells. &#147;Armored&#148; CARs deliver cytokines or other stimulatory signals to modify the tumor microenvironment. We believe these technologies may be important for the treatment of solid tumors.

	The immune system recognizes danger signals and responds to threats at a cellular level. It is often described as having two arms. The first
	arm is known as the innate immune system, which recognizes non-specific signals of infection or abnormalities as a first line of defense. The innate immune system is the initial response to an infection, and the response is the same every time
	regardless of prior exposure to the infectious agent. The second arm is known as the adaptive immune system, which is composed of highly specific, targeted cells and provides long-term recognition and protection from infectious agents and abnormal

	immune response capable of clearing an infection or eliminating cancerous cells. CD4+ T cells, or helper T cells, are generally involved in coordinating the immune response by enhancing the activation, expansion, migration, and effector functions of
	other types of immune cells. CD8+ T cells, or cytotoxic T cells, can directly attack and kill cells they recognize as infected or otherwise abnormal, and are aided by CD4+ T cells. Both types of T cells are activated when their T cell receptor
	recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure expressed on the surface of another cell. This protein structure is composed of the major histocompatibility complex (&#147;MHC&#148;) and a small protein fragment, or peptide, derived from either
	proteins inside the cell or on the cell surface. Circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells survey the body differentiating between MHC/peptide structures containing &#147;foreign&#148; peptides and those containing &#147;self&#148; peptides. A foreign
	peptide may signal the presence of an immune threat, such as an infection or cancer, causing the T cell to activate, recruit other immune cells, and eliminate the targeted cell.

	Although the immune system is designed to identify foreign or abnormal proteins expressed on tumor cells, this process is often defective in cancer patients.
	The defective process sometimes occurs when the cancer cells closely resemble healthy cells and go unnoticed or if tumors lose their protein expression. Additionally, cancer cells employ a number of mechanisms to escape immune detection to suppress
	the effect of the immune response. Some tumors also encourage the production of regulatory T cells that block cytotoxic T cells that would normally attack the cancer.

	population. It is estimated that approximately 80% of the U.S. population has one of the four most common MHC types. Due to this variability, multiple different TCR product candidates will be needed to address any given target protein for a broad
	population. In contrast, CARs are capable of recognizing the target protein regardless of MHC type. Additionally, most of the TCR product candidates developed in the field to date have been designed to recognize peptides in the context of Class I
	MHC, which activates CD8+ cells and not CD4+ cells. The implications of the preferential CD8+ activation are not clear, but given the importance of CD8+ and CD4+ cells in a typical immune response, activation of a CD4+ cellular response is likely

	We are also exploring a number of technologies that modulate T cell biology and their biologic properties in patients. For
	example, we have partnered with Editas, a leader in applying genome editing such as CRISPR/Cas9 and Talon technologies to create human therapeutics, and Fate Therapeutics, a leader in using pharmacologic modulators such as small molecules to alter
	the properties of cells while they are
<I>
	ex vivo
</I>
	. With Editas, we are exploring the biologic implication on our engineered T cell technologies of knocking-out or altering the function of a number of human genes. With Fate Therapeutics, we are
	exploring the potential for these modulators to alter intracellular signaling pathways, with the potential to alter the subtype of T cell or the state of the T cell. The goal of these modifications is to improve efficacy and safety of our products.

	Much like our CAR
	technology, our high-affinity TCR technology is designed to activate a potent immune response against cancer through the introduction of engineered T cells. The gene sequence we introduce with our TCR technology encodes for the proteins required to
	assemble a TCR that recognizes a specific MHC/peptide structure. Modified T cells expressing a TCR construct have the potential advantage of recognizing peptides from cancer-associated proteins expressed either on the surface of or inside the tumor
	cell, which may allow us to target a broad range of tumors. Beyond the fact that TCRs can recognize peptides derived from intracellular proteins, another advantage of TCRs is that they are fully human and therefore may be less likely to elicit an
	immune response against the infused TCR cells.

	The engagement of a TCR is restricted to a certain MHC type. Due to the variability of MHC types across the human
	population, different TCRs will be required for various segments of the population. Our TCR constructs are selected by screening healthy donors for naturally-occurring high-affinity TCRs against a MHC/ peptide combination of interest. Depending on
	the binding affinity of the selected TCR construct, it is either used directly or modified by mutating a specific region, the hypervariable domain, of the TCR binding pocket to create a higher affinity construct. Based on the limited number of
	patients who have received any TCR treatment to date, these TCR cells appear to behave like endogenous T cells after re-infusion back into the patient. They undergo a process similar to an endogenous T cell of cell expansion and cytotoxic activation
	upon recognition of their defined cancer-associated proteins.

	Important areas of investment for us going forward will be industrializing the creation and manufacturing of TCRs,
	improving screening processes to better ensure that TCR constructs do not cross-react with normally expressed or other proteins, and finding costimulatory signals to enhance the potency of the genetically engineered cells.

	We recently acquired AbVitro, a company based in Boston, Massachusetts with technology to perform next-generation, high throughput, single cell sequencing.
	This technology allows us to interrogate millions of cells per experiment. An important application for this technology will be to find high affinity, naturally occurring, matched chain TCRs from the normal human immune repertoire, which we believe
	have a lower risk of unexpected off-target binding than TCRs that have manipulated or mutagenized during development. We believe this technology will significantly improve the speed at which we find these TCRs, allowing us to optimize binding
	affinity and develop TCRs for a larger percentage of the population.

	access to and clinical experience with multiple CD19 CARs in patients with B cell malignancies gives us the opportunity to bring best-in-class therapies to market across a range of different blood cancers. We have treated over 250 patients with
	anti-CD19 CAR T cells.

	CD19 is not known to be expressed on any healthy tissue other than B cells. Although treatment with a CD19-directed therapy has the potential to deplete B cells, experience with Rituxan has shown that humans can live
	with B cell depletion for a prolonged period. Further, CD19 is not expressed on hematopoietic stem cells, and therefore B cells should return when the CAR T cell is no longer present.

	is an uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoblasts, which are immature white blood cells. The lymphoblasts, which are produced in the bone marrow, cause damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells. Approximately 6,000 patients are
	diagnosed with ALL in the United States each year, and although just over half of the new diagnoses are in adult patients, the vast majority of the approximately 1,400 deaths per year occur in adults. There are two main types of ALL, B cell ALL and
	T cell ALL. Approximately 80% of cases of ALL are B cell ALL, which we aim to address with our CD19 product candidates.

	occurs when a patient has all of the above outcomes and there is no evidence of ALL cells in the marrow when using sensitive tests such as polymerase chain reaction (&#147;PCR&#148;) and/or flow cytometry. CR rates are the typical regulatory

	Current standard-of-care treatment for both adults and children involves multi-drug chemotherapeutic regimens,
	and in some cases hematopoietic stem cell transplant (&#147;HSCT&#148;). In adults with ALL, approximately 80% of patients will demonstrate a complete remission with their initial course of chemotherapy. However, approximately 60% of patients who
	have so demonstrated a complete remission with their initial course of chemotherapy will relapse. Most patients that relapse after the first course of chemotherapy will die in well under a year, and patients that have failed at least two salvage
	therapies have a median survival that is typically around three months. Allogeneic HSCT, which uses hematopoietic stem cells from a matched donor, offers the potential for disease eradication in some individuals, however, the option is available
	only to approximately a third of patients due to the lack of compatible stem cell source, general health, or the high risk of complications. Even with HSCT, approximately 20-30% of patients die of treatment-related complications and the median
	disease-free survival is less than six months.

	Antibody-based platforms, including bispecific T cell enhancers (&#147;BiTEs&#148;) and antibody&#150;drug conjugates
	(&#147;ADCs&#148;) have also been explored in this disease setting. The FDA granted accelerated approval in late 2014 to blinatumomab, a CD19 BiTE given by continuous infusion due to its short serum half life, for treatment of individuals with r/r
	Philadelphia-chromosome negative ALL. Despite a CR rate of 42% and a CRm rate of 31%, which represent a meaningful improvement versus historical standards, the median duration of response was just under 6 months. Another novel agent, inotuzumab
	ozogamicin (&#147;inotuzumab&#148;), a CD22 monoclonal ADC conjugated to calicheamicin, has been studied in adults with r/r ALL. The reported results from a Phase III randomized trial of inotuzumab plus induction chemotherapy, as compared against
	induction chemotherapy on its own, demonstrated a CR rate of 81% but a median duration of response of 4.6 months. Although these novel agents have improved CR rates, such outcomes are not uniform with later relapses, higher burden disease, or in all
	age groups. Thus, significant unmet need remains. Of note, the majority of inotuzumab treated patients were in first relapse, while the blinatumomab data and data for JCAR015 are primarily in patients after a second or greater relapse.

	The indolent lymphomas represent a wide group of tumors that often have a long natural history characterized by frequent relapses; together, the indolent
	lymphomas account for approximately 55% of NHL incidence in the United States. Although these malignancies are treated routinely with a combination of chemotherapy and antibodies, there is no standard of care for relapsed indolent NHL. The typical
	treatment approaches include multiple rounds of induction chemotherapy or more aggressive salvage therapies, including autologous HSCT, which uses the patient&#146;s own hematopoietic stem cells. Unfortunately, these treatments are generally not
	curative. Patients with recurrent or progressive indolent lymphoma may be candidates for allogeneic HSCT, which can provide long-term disease free survival to some.

	Nearly all CLL is characterized by CD5+ B cells, which express CD19. Approximately 80&#150;85% of individuals with CLL have standard risk disease at diagnosis, and for them the level of disease burden determines both prognosis and the need for
	immediate treatment or &#147;watchful waiting&#148; before the initiation of any therapy. Over time, CLL develops poor risk features, including expression of CD38, ZAP70, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain sequences, or cytogenetic abnormalities
	or gene mutations. Approximately 15&#150;20% of CLL patients can initially present with poor risk disease. Median progression-free survival in these high risk groups is often under 12 to 18 months after frontline therapy, and less than 12 months in

	The goal of therapy in CLL for individuals with both treatment na&iuml;ve and relapsed/refractory disease is a clinical

	and relapsed/refractory CLL, including combination chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, ibrutinib, idelalisib, alemtuzumab, and ofatumumab, and several others continue in development. However, the enthusiasm for these agents has generally been tempered
	by the low likelihood of complete responses, challenging toxicities, and limited duration of disease responses. Individuals with CLL are generally not considered candidates for allogeneic or autologous transplantation due in part to the median age
	of 71 years at diagnosis. Therefore, significant opportunity exists for novel therapies to address this unmet need with agents that are tolerated in this patient population.

	The notable side effects of JCAR015 are severe cytokine release syndrome (&#147;sCRS&#148;) and severe neurotoxicity. sCRS
	is a condition that, by convention, is currently defined clinically by certain side effects, including hypotension, or low blood pressure, when such side effects are serious enough to lead to intensive care unit care with mechanical ventilation or
	significant vasopressor support. CRS is generally believed to result from the release of inflammatory proteins in the body as the CAR T cells rapidly multiply in the presence of the target tumor proteins. Severe neurotoxicity can have several
	clinical manifestations, including confusion, aphasia, encephalopathy, myoclonus and generalized seizure.

	Severe neurotoxicity is defined as events having grade 3 or higher severity as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (&#147;CTCAE&#148;) for each manifestation. These severe
	neurotoxicity events may require ICU level care. As of a data cutoff date of November&nbsp;2, 2015, approximately 24% of 46 adult r/r ALL patients experienced sCRS, with a rate of 0% in patients with minimal residual disease and 44% in patients with
	morphologic disease. Approximately 28% of 46 adult r/r ALL patients experienced severe neurotoxicity, with a rate of 14% in patients with minimal residual disease and 40% in patients with morphologic disease. We define minimal residual disease as
	the presence of no more than 5% lymphoblasts in a patient&#146;s bone marrow and morphologic disease as more than 5% lymphoblasts in a patient&#146;s bone marrow. Among the patients with sCRS, there have been two deaths that we believe were either
	directly or indirectly related to sCRS. Other than sCRS and severe neurotoxicity, JCAR015 has been generally well tolerated.

	Several protocol changes were made in April 2014 after treatment-emergent adverse events led to the death of two patients. The
	most important changes included using a lower dose of CAR T cells (1x10&#094;6/kg vs 3x10&#094;6/kg) in patients with morphologic r/r ALL, excluding patients with Class III or IV congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association,
	excluding patients with active central nervous system leukemia or symptomatic central nervous system leukemia within 28 days, adding sCRS as a dose limiting toxicity, and restricting a patient from receiving a second treatment of JCAR015 if the
	patient experienced any non-hematologic CTCAE grade 4 toxicities, including sCRS, with the prior JCAR015 treatment. Prior to the protocol changes, patients typically received a dose of 3x10&#094;6 CAR T cells/kg regardless of the level of disease
	burden. We continue to examine the effect of a second scheduled dose delivered approximately three weeks following the first dose and the use of alternative pre-conditioning regimens containing fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. We expect to have
	additional data from this trial over the next six to 18&nbsp;months.

	We began a Phase II, multicenter, pivotal trial in 2015 under a Juno-sponsored IND. We plan to treat approximately 90 adult r/r ALL patients with JCAR015
	across more than 15 world-class cancer centers in order to have approximately 50 evaluable patients, which is defined as r/r ALL patients with morphologic ALL at the time of JCAR015 infusion. The trial design includes optimized dosing schedule and
	pre-conditioning. The primary endpoint is overall response rate, defined as the proportion of subjects with CR or CR with incomplete hematological recovery. Patients will also be evaluated and followed for several secondary endpoints, including but
	not limited to safety, durability of responses, cellular kinetics, disease control rate, and comparability of Phase II manufacturing product to Phase I manufacturing product.

	Overview
</I>
	. JCAR017 also
	targets CD19, but differs from JCAR015 in several important respects. JCAR017 uses the 4-1BB costimulatory domain, a different scFv binding domain and a defined cell composition made up of a 1:1 ratio of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. This defined
	cell composition is attained by using separate CD4+ and CD8+ selection and processing and then controlling for the number of each cell subtype in the final product. This minimizes the leukemia contamination risk and provides a consistent T cell
	phenotype ratio.

	Clinical Experience
</I>
	.
	JCAR017 is being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial in pediatric r/r ALL. An IND application for JCAR017 was submitted in November 2013 by SCRI, the Phase I/II trial sponsor, for the treatment of CD19 positive pediatric leukemia. The trial was
	initiated in January 2014. The Phase I/II trial is designed to evaluate four dose levels: 5x10&#094;5 T cells/kg, 1x10&#094;6 T cells/kg, 5x10&#094;6 T cells/kg, and 1x10&#094;7 T cells/kg. The primary endpoints of the trial are to evaluate the
	preliminary toxicity, safety, and efficacy of JCAR017, and the feasibility of manufacturing and releasing JCAR017, in children and young adults with CD19- positive pediatric leukemia. The secondary endpoints of the trial include assessing
	persistence of the modified T cells and potentially assessing the efficacy of cetuximab to eliminate the modified T cells. Patients enrolled in this trial initially received low-intensity chemotherapy prior to receiving their CAR T cell dose, and
	maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 5x10&#094;6 T cells/kg. More recently, a much lower cell dose of 5x10&#094;5 T cells/kg has been tested with intensified pre-conditioning, and early results with this regimen have demonstrated an improved
	risk/benefit profile for this agent.

	Patients treated in this trial have experienced the highest cell expansion and longest cell persistence in
	the body of any of our CD19-directed product candidates prior to the introduction of flu/cy conditioning. Improving cell expansion and persistence translates into an increase in exposure of cancer cells in the body to the CAR T cells, the active
	ingredient in our treatment. Increasing this exposure is an important goal of our basic and translational research. We believe, and data from studies for product candidates such as JCAR014 show, that increasing this exposure translates into improved
	clinical benefit. Additionally, JCAR017 is a defined cell product that has a number of manufacturing related advantages compared to JCAR014 that may translate into both better clinical results and long-term cost of goods. Because of these potential
	advantages in both exposure and manufacturing, we have chosen to move forward with JCAR017 as the backbone for our multi-center, Phase I trial in r/r NHL. We also plan to study it across a number of additional treatment settings if results continue
	to support these potential advantages.

	Overview
</I>
	. JCAR014 also targets CD19. JCAR014 uses the 4-1BB costimulatory domain and is composed of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells in a defined ratio.
	JCAR014 was originally developed at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (&#147;FHCRC&#148;).

	Clinical Experience
</I>
	. JCAR014 is being
	evaluated in a Phase I/II trial as a treatment for adults with any of several B cell malignancies, including ALL, NHL, and CLL, in patients relapsed or refractory to standard therapies. An IND application for JCAR014 was submitted in March 2013 by
	FHCRC&#146;s Stanley Riddell, the Phase I/II trial sponsor, for the treatment of CD19-positive advanced B cell malignancies. The trial was initiated in May 2013. The Phase I/II trial is designed to evaluate three dose levels: 2x10&#094;5 T cells/kg,
	2x10&#094;6 T cells/kg, and 2x10&#094;7 T cells/kg. The highest dose level of 2x10&#094;7 T cells/kg has been discontinued as it exceeded the maximum tolerated dose as defined by the study. The primary endpoint of the trial is to evaluate the
	feasibility and preliminary safety of using JCAR014 to treat CD19-positive advanced B cell malignancies. The secondary endpoints of the trial include assessing the duration of persistence of the modified T cells, determining whether the modified T
	cells traffic in the bone marrow and function
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	, determining if the modified T cells have antitumor activity in patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer, and determining if the treatment is associated with tumor
	lysis syndrome. As of a data cutoff date of December&nbsp;1, 2015, 71 patients have been treated in the Phase I portion of the trial, of which 30 patients had r/r ALL, 32 patients had r/r NHL, and nine patients had r/r CLL. Patients enrolled in this
	trial initially received low-intensity chemotherapy prior to receiving their CAR T cell dose. This trial has systematically evaluated alternative pre-conditioning regimens and established a flu/cy pre-conditioning regimen that supports significantly
	improved cell expansion, cell persistence, and complete response rates. The combination of this regimen and the JCAR014 defined cell product also demonstrated relatively low frequency of severe CRS and neurotoxicity at lower dosing levels for all
	diseases.
<I>
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A key finding of the early phase of the trial was that patients with greater cell expansion and longer cell persistence generally
	derived better clinical benefit. Data for JCAR014 using a flu/cy pre-conditioning regimen were presented at ASH 2015 and demonstrated improved cell expansion and cell persistence in individuals with r/r ALL, r/r NHL, and r/r CLL.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In r/r ALL, 17 patients have been treated with JCAR014 using a flu/cy pre-conditioning regimen, with 100% achieving a CR and a CRm based upon
	investigator-reported interim data. The reported follow-up was relatively short, but clearly was showing improved durability of response.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In r/r NHL, the
	JCAR014 experience with flu/cy pre-conditioning in 18 evaluable patients demonstrated a complete response rate of 50%, as defined by International Working Group Criteria [2007], and produced severe CRS in 20% and severe neurotoxicity in 35% of
	patients. At the currently planned dose for r/r NHL patients, 2x10&#094;6 T cells/kg, in 11 evaluable patients, JCAR014 has achieved a 64% complete response rate and 82% complete or partial response rate. In the eight r/r NHL patients with DLBCL,
	75% had a complete response and 100% of patients had a complete or partial response. At this dose, 9% of r/r NHL patients experienced sCRS and 18% of r/r NHL patients had severe neurotoxicity. For the JCAR014 trial, sCRS is defined as the occurrence
	of certain side effects, which can include hypotension or respiratory distress that required ICU level care. Patients from this portion of the trial have been followed for between two and nine months, and as of the data cut-off date of
	December&nbsp;1, 2015, all patients with a complete response remained in remission.

	In r/r CLL, seven patients have been treated with JCAR014 using a flu/cy pre-conditioning regimen. All seven had

	As presented at ASH 2015, in the full Phase I portion of the trial, this defined cell product candidate displayed a side effect profile that is similar

	experienced sCRS and 50% of r/r ALL patients experienced severe neurotoxicity, and 11% of patients with r/r CLL have experienced sCRS and 33% of patients with r/r CLL have experienced severe neurotoxicity. There have been two patient deaths in r/r
	ALL patients treated with JCAR014&#151;one at the highest dose, 2x10&#094;7 T cells/kg, and one at the middle dose, 2x10&#094;6 T cells/kg&#151;that we believe were either directly or indirectly related to sCRS or severe neurotoxicity. There have
	also been two patient deaths in r/r NHL patients treated with JCAR014, both at the highest dose, that we believe were either directly or indirectly related to sCRS or severe neurotoxicity. As a result of the patient deaths, the highest dose level is

	with CD19-directed therapies has led to the emergence in some patients of CD19-negative cancer cells. To date, these patients&#146; cancer cells have retained CD22 expression, potentially making a CD22-directed CAR T cell product candidate an
	important potential treatment for these patients. Similar to CD19, CD22 is not known to be expressed on any healthy tissue other than B cells. It is also not expressed on hematopoietic stem cells, and therefore B cells should return when the CAR T
	cell is no longer present.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	JCAR018 is the CD22-directed CAR product candidate with respect to which we have licensed technology from Opus Bio. This
	product candidate was originally developed at the NCI. It has a fully human scFv and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. Data from mouse models suggest that JCAR018 will have comparable efficacy in lymphoma and leukemia as CD19-directed CAR T cells.
	Patient enrollment has commenced in a Phase I trial sponsored by the NCI. This Phase I trial will enroll patients one year to 30 years in age that have CD22-positive r/r ALL or r/r NHL. The trial is open to patients who have either CD19-negative or
	CD19-positive disease and who have or have not received previous CAR T cell treatment. Preliminary results with the lowest JCAR018 cell dose, as well as one patient at the next highest dose, were presented at ASH 2015. JCAR018 demonstrated
	anti-tumor activity in r/r ALL patients, including both patients that had previously been treated with an anti-CD19 CAR therapy and those who had not, with two out of seven achieving a CRm. The product candidate had generally manageable adverse
	events. The dose escalation portion of this trial will continue during 2016. We recently achieved the first clinical milestone under our license agreement for this product candidate, for which paid Opus Bio a milestone payment in equity. We plan to

	JCAR020 is our first development candidate that uses our &#147;armored CAR&#148; technology. IL-12 is a cytokine
	that can help overcome the inhibitory effects that the tumor micro-environment can have on T cell activity. Systemic delivery of IL-12 has been limited to date by severe side effects, which have included severe hematological toxicity, severe hepatic
	dysfunction, and immune reactive events such as colitis, some of which resulted in deaths and trial stoppage. However, we believe local delivery to the tumor may provide efficacy while avoiding these side effects. JCAR020 secretes IL-12. Because CAR
	T cells aggregate at the target protein, IL-12 delivery is likely to concentrate in areas with significant MUC-16 protein expression, in this case, MUC-16 expressing cancers. We believe the armored CAR utilizing IL-12 has the potential to enhance T

	We are devoting significant resources to process development and manufacturing in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, as well

	As for the
	immunotherapy products and processes we develop and commercialize, in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, when possible, composition, method of use, dosing and formulation patent protection. We may also pursue patent protection with
	respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technology. The patents and patent applications outside of the United States in our portfolio are held primarily in Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal
	term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term
	can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed
	14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. Our issued patents will
	expire on dates ranging from 2019 to 2031. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2021 to 2037. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a
	product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country,
	and the validity and enforceability of the patent.

	The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and
	factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either
	the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property.
	In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our
	technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent
	applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the methods used to manufacture those
	products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. We have conducted analyses of the patent landscape with respect to our CD19 product
	candidates, and based on these analyses, we believe we will have freedom to operate with respect to our most advanced CD19 product candidates, by which we mean we believe that we will be able to commercialize them. However, the area of patent and

	our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term
	of patent protection that we may have for our product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our
	competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential

	In connection with the collaboration agreement in October 2013, we entered into a

	letter agreement to make certain clarifying amendments thereto. These success payments are based on increases in the per share fair market value of our common stock during the term of the success payment agreement, which is a period of time that
	begins on the date of our collaboration agreement with FHCRC and ends on the later of: (1)&nbsp;the eighth anniversary of that date and (2)&nbsp;the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the eleventh anniversary of that date and (b)&nbsp;the third anniversary of the

	in connection with the following valuation measurement dates during the term of the success payment agreement: (1)&nbsp;December 19, 2014 (the date our common stock first became publicly traded upon our initial public offering); (2)&nbsp;the date on
	which we sell, lease, transfer, or exclusively license all or substantially all of our assets to another company; (3)&nbsp;the date on which we merge or consolidate with or into another entity (other than a merger in which our pre-merger
	stockholders own a majority of the shares of the surviving entity); (4)&nbsp;any date on which ARCH Venture Fund VII, L.P. or C.L. Alaska L.P. transfers a majority of its shares of company capital stock held by it on such date to a third party;
	(5)&nbsp;every second anniversary of any event described in the preceding clauses (1), (2), (3)&nbsp;or (4), but only upon a request by FHCRC made within 20 calendar days after receiving written notice from us of such event; and (6)&nbsp;the last
	day of the term of the success payment agreement. Any success payment will generally be made within 90 days after the applicable valuation measurement date, except that (1)&nbsp;in the case of an initial public offering, the payment was required on
	December&nbsp;21, 2015, which was the first business day following the first anniversary of the date our common stock first became publicly traded upon our initial public offering, and (2)&nbsp;in the case of a merger or sale of all of our
	company&#146;s assets, the success payment will be made on the earlier of the 90th day following the transaction or the first date that transaction proceeds are paid to any of our stockholders. In the case of an initial public offering, the value of

	within such know-how, and nonexclusive with respect to such know-how and related intellectual property rights. The patents and patent applications covered by this agreement are directed, in part, to CAR constructs, including bispecific and armored

	agreement, with such payments creditable against royalties. The license agreement requires us to pay to MSK mid-to-high single-digit royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products or the performance of licensed services by us and our
	affiliates and sublicensees, which royalty will be reduced in the case of licensed products or services that are not covered by a valid patent in the country in which such products or services are manufactured or commercialized. In addition, if the

	the first commercial sale of such product. We may also be obligated to pay to MSK up to a maximum of $6.75 million in clinical and regulatory milestone payments for each licensed product, which includes JCAR015. In addition, we are required to pay
	to MSK a percentage of certain payments that we receive from sublicensees of the rights licensed to us by MSK, which percentage will be based upon the date we receive such payments, the commitments we make for the development of licensed products

	In April 2015, St. Jude and we agreed to settle the litigation with Penn and Novartis. In connection with such settlement, we entered into a sublicense
	agreement (the &#147;Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement&#148;) with Penn and an affiliate of Novartis pursuant to which Juno granted to Novartis a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing sublicense under certain patent rights, including the &#145;645 Patent,
	to develop, make and commercialize licensed products and licensed services for all therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative and palliative uses. This sublicense is not sublicensable without our prior written consent, although Novartis may authorize
	third parties to act on its behalf with respect to the manufacture, development or commercialization of Novartis&#146; licensed products and licensed services. Pursuant to the Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement, Novartis paid Juno $12.3 million upon
	the effectiveness of such agreement, which amount was first applied to cover certain predetermined litigation expenses incurred by St. Jude, with the remainder divided between Juno and St. Jude at a fixed ratio. In addition, Novartis is also
	required to pay mid-single digit royalties on the U.S. net sales of products and services related to the disputed contract and patent claims (the &#147;Novartis Royalty Payments&#148;), a low double digit percentage of the royalties Novartis pays to
	Penn for global net sales of those products (the &#147;Penn Royalty Payments&#148;), and milestone payments upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones for licensed products (the &#147;Novartis Milestone
	Payments&#148;). If Juno achieves any of the milestones prior to Novartis, the related Novartis Milestone Payment will be reduced by 50%. In addition, if Juno achieves any milestone after Novartis, Juno will reimburse Novartis 50% of any Novartis
	Milestone Payment previously paid by Novartis to Juno in respect of such milestone. These milestones largely overlap with the milestones for which Juno may owe a payment to St. Jude under the St. Jude License Agreement and the Novartis Milestone
	Payments would in effect serve to partially offset Juno&#146;s obligations to St. Jude with respect to such milestones.

	upon the occurrence of certain specified breaches, or upon advance written notice in the event of the other party&#146;s uncured material breach. Novartis may terminate the Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement at will upon advance written notice to

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Opus Bio pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under
	certain patent rights and data to research, develop, make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold, offer to sell, import and otherwise exploit products that incorporate or use engineered T cells directed against CD22 and that are covered by such
	patent rights or use or incorporate such data. Certain of the licensed patent rights are in-licensed by Opus Bio from the National Institutes of Health (&#147;NIH&#148;). The patents and patent applications covered by this agreement are directed, in
	part, to various human monoclonal antibodies specific for CD22 and their use in immunotherapy. Pursuant to this license agreement, as of January&nbsp;31, 2016, we have rights to four issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, and a
	number of other patents and patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States. The licensed data was generated under an agreement between Opus Bio and the National Cancer Institute (&#147;NCI&#148;) and Opus Bio&#146;s rights to the
	licensed data are not exclusive. Our rights to such data are therefore exclusive only as between us and Opus, and non-exclusive as between us and third parties, who may license such data from the NCI. Our license from Opus Bio is limited to the
	field of treating B cell malignancies that express CD22 on their cell surface using CARs containing certain specified antibody binding fragments. Under the agreement, we will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop,
	and commercialize licensed products. Such development must be in accordance with the timelines provided in the license agreement for achievement of certain clinical, regulatory, and commercial benchmarks, and with the development plans set forth in
	Opus Bio&#146;s agreements with the NIH. In November 2015, the license agreement was amended to adjust certain of these timelines.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon the effectiveness
	of this license in December 2014, we made an upfront payment to Opus Bio of $20.0 million in cash and issued to Opus Bio 1,602,564 shares of our common stock. Upon our achievement of certain clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones set forth
	in the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay Opus Bio additional consideration. The consideration due upon achievement of the first three clinical milestones would consist of additional shares of our common stock in an amount equal to the
	dollar value specified for the applicable milestone, which is $52.5 million in the aggregate for the three milestones, divided by the greater of $10.92 and the arithmetic average of the daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock on The
	NASDAQ Global Select Market over the 30 trading days preceding the achievement of the milestone, up to a maximum of 4,807,692 shares in the aggregate (this minimum per share value and maximum number of shares subject, in each case, to adjustment for
	any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, or other similar events). Upon our achievement of any subsequent milestones, we will be obligated to pay Opus Bio cash consideration, which potential milestone payments total $215.0 million in
	the aggregate. Once certain milestones have been achieved, we will be required to spend at least $2.5 million per year on development and commercialization of licensed products. In January 2016, the first clinical milestone of $20.0 million was
	achieved, and we issued 408,068 shares of our common stock as payment. The license agreement further provides that we are required to pay to Opus Bio tiered royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products by us and by our sublicensees, at
	rates ranging from the low-single to mid-single digits. We will also be required to make certain pass-through payments owed by Opus Bio to NIH under its NIH license agreements, including certain patent costs, development and commercial milestones of
	up to $2.8 million in the aggregate, and low single-digit royalties based on annual net sales.

	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product
	candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new
	drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	studies assessing the toxicology,
	pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become
	effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such
	a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin
	a clinical trial.

	When a trial using genetically engineered cells is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant

	Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (&#147;NIH Guidelines&#148;). Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, and many companies and other
	institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (&#147;RAC&#148;), a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel
	or particularly important scientific, safety, or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#146;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a protocol. RAC proceedings and
	reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. If the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that
	sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process.

	Clinical trials involve the administration of the
	investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical
	study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND
	must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan
	for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various
	grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies, including our Phase II trial for JCAR015, also include oversight by an
	independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain
	data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing
	clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.

	clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s
	continued safety, purity and potency.

	The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the
	product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within
	required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are
	not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application
	does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

	The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and
	each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude
	us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete
	Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the
	application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or
	information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.

	If regulatory approval of a product is
	granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#147;REMS&#148;) plan to ensure the benefits of the
	product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication
	guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed
	labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product
	reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product
	based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#146;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory
	approval of our products under development.

	A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA&#146;s review
	and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition
	and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant
	criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is
	granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious disease or condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the
	application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to
	support approval.

	Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint
	that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other
	clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally
	required to verify the biologic&#146;s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act
	(&#147;FDASIA&#148;), which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended,
	alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing
	therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of or any time after the submission
	of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase II meeting with FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the
	sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical
	and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA
	review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may
	result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast
	track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application
	and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. We plan to seek designation as a breakthrough therapy for some or all of our CD19 product candidates, as qualification permits. Our collaborator MSK obtained breakthrough
	therapy designation for JCAR015 for r/r ALL, but we will have to seek such designation separately under our own IND.

	Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government
	health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, integrated delivery networks, and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product
	candidates, if approved, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly
	approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and
	expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be
	available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.

	The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare
	system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of

	By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth
	of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.

	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted.
	These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless
	additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased
	the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse

	We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well

	reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate

	In the EU,
	member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the EU regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be
	submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. It is compulsory for medicines produced by certain
	biotechnological processes. Because our products are produced in that way, we would be subject to the centralized process. Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the European
	Medicines Agency (&#147;EMA&#148;). Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states, as well as the European Economic Area countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. By law, a company

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are not profitable and have incurred losses
	in each period since our inception. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 and for the period from August&nbsp;5, 2013 to December&nbsp;31, 2013, we reported a net loss of $239.4 million, $243.4 million, and $51.8&nbsp;million,
	respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $585.7&nbsp;million, which includes $51.1 million related to non-cash deemed dividends, $159.4 million in upfront fees to acquire technology, of which $85.5 million was
	paid in cash and $73.9 million was paid through the issuance of common stock, non-cash expense of $136.5 million associated with the change in the estimated fair value and elapsed service period for our potential and actual success payment liability
	to FHCRC and MSK, and $10.7&nbsp;million of expense associated with our convertible preferred stock options. We expect these losses to increase as we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing
	operations, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, scale-up manufacturing capabilities and hire additional personnel to support the development of our product candidates and to enhance our operational, financial and information

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A critical aspect of our strategy is to invest significantly in our technology platform to improve the efficacy and safety of our
	product candidates. Even if we succeed in commercializing one or more of these product candidates, we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future relating to our substantial research and development expenditures to develop our
	technologies. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our
	expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders&#146; equity and working capital. Further, the net losses we incur may fluctuate
	significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period to period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.

	Even if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate

	processes or assays, or to perform clinical, nonclinical, or other types of studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our

	more of our CD19 product candidates. Our most advanced product candidates, JCAR015, JCAR017, and JCAR014, are in clinical development, have been tested in a relatively small number of patients, and will require additional clinical and nonclinical
	development, regulatory review and approval in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market the products, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity, and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any
	revenue from product sales. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the product candidates
	in humans. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical studies and they may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical studies.

	In addition, because JCAR015, JCAR017, and JCAR014 are our most advanced product candidates, and because our other product candidates are based on similar
	technology, if JCAR015, JCAR017, or JCAR014 encounter safety or efficacy problems, developmental delays, regulatory issues, reagent supply issues, or other problems, our development plans and business could be significantly harmed. Further,
	competitors who are developing products with similar technology may experience problems with their products that could identify problems that would potentially harm our business.

	Prior to the Juno-sponsored Phase I trial of JCAR017 and the Phase II clinical trial of JCAR015 that began
	in 2015, third parties had sponsored and conducted all clinical trials of our CD19 product candidates and other product candidates, and our ability to influence the design and conduct of such trials has been limited. We have assumed control over the
	future clinical and regulatory development of JCAR015 and, for NHL, JCAR017, and may do so for other product candidates, which will entail additional expenses and may be subject to delay. Any failure by a third party to meet its obligations with
	respect to the clinical and regulatory development of our product candidates may delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and result in liability for our company.

	Prior to the Juno-sponsored Phase I clinical trial of JCAR017 and the Phase II clinical trial of JCAR015, both of which began in 2015, we had not sponsored any
	clinical trials relating to our CD19 product candidates or other product candidates. Instead, faculty members at our third-party research institution collaborators, or those institutions themselves, sponsored all clinical trials relating to these
	product candidates, in each case under their own INDs. We have now assumed control of the overall clinical and regulatory development of JCAR015 and, for NHL, JCAR017 for future clinical trials. We may assume control over the clinical and regulatory
	development of other product candidates in the future, in which case we will need to obtain sponsorship of the INDs or file new Juno-sponsored INDs. Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, sponsorship of INDs or in filing new Juno-sponsored INDs
	for these or any other product candidates we determine to advance could negatively affect the timing of our potential future clinical trials. Additionally, although MSK received breakthrough therapy designation for JCAR015 from the FDA, we will
	separately need to request breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA under our own IND, which designation we may not be successful in obtaining, which could adversely affect the timing of future clinical trials and regulatory review and
	approval. Any such impacts on timing could increase research and development costs and could delay or prevent obtaining regulatory approval for our most advanced product candidates, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our
	business.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Further, even in the event that the IND sponsorship is or has been obtained for existing and new INDs, we did not control the design or conduct
	of the previous trials. It is possible that the FDA will not accept these previous trials as providing adequate support for future clinical trials, whether controlled by us or third parties, for any of one or more reasons, including the safety,
	purity, and potency of the product candidate, the degree of product characterization, elements of the design or execution of the previous trials or safety concerns, or other trial results. We may also be subject to liabilities arising from any
	treatment-related injuries or adverse effects in patients enrolled in these previous trials. As a result, we may be subject to unforeseen third-party claims and delays in our potential future clinical trials. We may also be required to repeat in
	whole or in part clinical trials previously conducted by our third-party research institution collaborators, which will be expensive and delay the submission and licensure or other regulatory approvals with respect to any of our product candidates.
	Any such delay or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although we have assumed control of the overall clinical and regulatory
	development of JCAR015 and, for NHL, JCAR017 going forward, we expect to be dependent on our contractual arrangements with third-party research institution collaborators for ongoing and planned trials for our other product candidates, and for
	JCAR017 other than in NHL, until we determine to assume control of the clinical and regulatory development of those candidates. Such arrangements provide us certain information rights with respect to certain previous, planned, or ongoing trials with
	respect to our product candidates, including access to and the ability to use and reference the data, including for our own regulatory filings, resulting from such trials. Even after we assume control of the overall clinical and regulatory
	development of a product candidate, including JCAR015 and JCAR017, we will still remain dependent on such contractual data rights for use in our clinical and regulatory development activities. If these obligations are breached by our third-party
	research institution collaborators, or if the data, or our data rights, prove to be inadequate compared to the first-hand knowledge we might have gained had the completed trials been Juno-sponsored trials, then our ability to design and conduct our
	corporate-sponsored clinical trials may be adversely affected. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with the sufficiency of our right to reference the preclinical, manufacturing, or clinical data generated by these prior investigator-sponsored trials,
	or our interpretation of preclinical, manufacturing, or clinical data from these clinical trials. If

	Additionally, we may remain dependent on our third-party research institution collaborators for other
	support services in connection with our Juno-sponsored clinical trials. For instance, we will be dependent on SCRI for the manufacture of JCAR017 for our Juno-sponsored Phase I trial in r/r NHL until we transition the manufacturing of such product
	candidate to our Juno-operated manufacturing facility later in 2016. Transferring the process to our Juno-operated facility may also prove more difficult or take more time than we currently estimate, and it may not occur in 2016 or ever. This
	dependence on SCRI for the manufacture of JCAR017 will subject us to risks such as those described below under &#147;&#151;
<I>
	We expect to rely on third parties to manufacture our clinical product supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties for
	at least a portion of the manufacturing process of our product candidates, if approved. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or
	prices.

	Clinical testing is expensive, time consuming, and subject to uncertainty. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted
	as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. We expect that the early clinical work performed by our third-party research institution collaborators will help support the filing with the FDA of multiple INDs for product candidates in the next five
	years. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs at this rate, and we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. Moreover, even if these trials begin, issues may arise that
	could suspend or terminate such clinical trials. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical studies may not be successful. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical
	development include:

	In particular, if Celgene opts to exercise its options to license any product candidates under the collaboration agreement with
	us, we may have limited influence or control over their approaches to development and commercialization in the territories in which they lead development and commercialization. Although we will still lead development and commercialization activities
	in North America for our product candidates arising from programs for which Celgene has exercised an option, Celgene&#146;s development and commercialization activities in the territories where it is the lead party may adversely impact our own
	efforts in North America. Failure by Celgene to meet its obligations under the collaboration agreement and any co-development or co-commercialization agreement we enter into, or failure by Celgene to apply sufficient efforts at developing and

	require some level of assistance from us with respect to product candidates it opts into, and this assistance could be burdensome on our organization and resources and disrupt our own development and commercialization activities for product

	We have begun a trial in adult relapsed/refractory ALL with JCAR015 that could
	support accelerated U.S. regulatory approval. We also have begun a Phase I trial in adult relapsed/refractory NHL with JCAR017, with the potential to move to a registration trial in 2016 or early 2017. We intend to conduct each of these clinical
	trials in the United States. If the results of these trials are sufficiently compelling, we intend to discuss with the FDA filing BLAs for accelerated approval of such CD19 product candidates as a treatment for patients who are refractory to
	currently approved treatments in these indications.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA generally requires a BLA to be supported by two adequate and well-controlled Phase III
	studies or one large and robust, well-controlled Phase III study in the patient population being studied that provides substantial evidence that a biologic is safe, pure and potent. Phase III clinical studies typically involve hundreds of patients,
	have significant costs and take years to complete. However, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may
	be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical
	benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the
	severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval to perform
	post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug or biologic may be subject to withdrawal procedures by the FDA that are more accelerated than those
	available for regular approvals. We believe our accelerated approval strategy is warranted given the currently limited alternative therapies for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL and relapsed/refractory NHL, but the FDA may not agree or
	alternative therapies may enter the market that cause the FDA to determine that the accelerated approval framework is no longer appropriate in those indications. The FDA may ultimately require one or multiple Phase III clinical trials prior to
	approval, particularly because our product candidates are novel and personalized treatments.

	The clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our products
	will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and market our product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the
	commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. In
	particular, because our product candidates are subject to regulation as biological drug products, we will need to demonstrate that they are safe, pure, and potent for use in their target indications. Each product candidate must demonstrate an
	adequate risk versus benefit profile in its intended patient population and for its intended use. The risk/benefit profile required for product licensure will vary depending on these factors and may include not only the ability to show tumor
	shrinkage, but also adequate duration of response, a delay in the progression of the disease, and/or an improvement in survival. For example, response rates from the use of our product candidates may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval
	unless we can also show an adequate duration of response. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of
	preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. The results of studies in one set of patients or line of treatment may not be predictive of those obtained
	in another. We expect there may be greater variability in results for products processed and administered on a patient-by-patient basis, as anticipated for our product candidates, than for &#147;off-the-shelf&#148; products, like many other drugs.
	There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile despite
	having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues,
	notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Most product candidates that begin clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization.

	Data from studies conducted by the third-party research institutions that are our collaboration partners, FHCRC, MSK, and SCRI, should not be relied upon as
	evidence that later or larger-scale clinical trials will succeed. Some future trials may have different patient populations than current studies and will test our product candidates in different indications, among other differences. In addition, our
	proposed manufacturing processes for our CD19 product candidates include what we believe will be process improvements that are not part of the production processes that are currently being used in the clinical trials being conducted by the research
	institutions. Accordingly, our results with our CD19 product candidates may not be consistent with the results of the clinical trials being conducted by our research institute collaborators.

	As with most biological drug products, use of our
	product candidates could be associated with side effects or adverse events which can vary in severity from minor reactions to death and in frequency from infrequent to prevalent. Undesirable side effects or unacceptable toxicities caused by our
	product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials. We have seen severe neurotoxicity or sCRS, in some cases leading to death, in a number of patients with ALL, NHL, or CLL using each of JCAR015,
	JCAR017, and JCAR014. Severe neurotoxicity is a condition that, by convention, is currently defined clinically by confusion or other central nervous system side effects, when such side effects are serious enough to lead to intensive care unit care.
	The exact cause of severe neurotoxicity in connection with treatment with CAR T cells is not fully understood at this time. sCRS is a condition that, by convention, is currently defined clinically by certain side effects, which can include fever,
	chills, and hypotension, or low blood pressure, related to the release of inflammatory proteins in the body as the CAR T cells rapidly multiply in the presence of the target tumor protein, when such side effects are serious enough to lead to
	intensive care unit care with mechanical ventilation or significant vasopressor support. In early 2014, two patient deaths in the JCAR015 trial, which we believe were either directly or indirectly related to sCRS, resulted in the FDA placing the
	trial on clinical hold. Several JCAR015 protocol changes were made after those deaths, the most important of which include using a lower dose in patients with morphologic relapsed/refractory ALL, excluding patients with Class III or IV congestive
	heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association, excluding patients with active central nervous system leukemia or symptomatic central nervous system leukemia within 28 days, adding sCRS as a dose limiting toxicity, and restricting a
	patient from receiving a second treatment of JCAR015 if the patient experienced any non-hematologic grade 4 toxicities, including sCRS, with the prior JCAR015 treatment. The protocol changes resulted in the FDA removing the clinical hold. However,
	these protocol changes may reduce efficacy and may not result in a better tolerability profile. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could delay or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications and
	negative side effects could result in a more restrictive label for any product that is approved. Side effects such as toxicity or other safety issues associated with the use of our product candidates could also require us or our collaborators to
	perform additional studies or halt development or sale of these product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Treatment-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment
	or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial, or could result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may not be appropriately or timely recognized or managed by the treating medical staff, particularly
	outside of the research institutions that collaborate with us, as toxicities resulting from personalized T cell therapy are not normally encountered in the general patient population and by medical personnel. We expect to have to train medical
	personnel using our product candidates to understand their side effect profiles, both for our planned clinical trials and upon any commercialization of any product candidates. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects
	of our product candidates could result in adverse effects to patients, including death. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition and prospects.

	and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. Because our product candidates are based on new technologies and manufactured on a patient-by-patient basis, we expect that they will require extensive research and
	development and have substantial manufacturing costs. In addition, costs to treat patients with relapsed/refractory cancer and to treat potential side effects that may result from our product candidates can be significant. Some clinical trial sites
	may not bill, or obtain coverage from, Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors for some or all of these costs for patients enrolled in our clinical trials, and we may be required by those trial sites to pay such costs. Accordingly, our
	clinical trial costs are likely to be significantly higher per patient than those of more conventional therapeutic technologies or drug products. In addition, our proposed personalized product candidates involve several complex and costly
	manufacturing and processing steps, the costs of which will be borne by us. Depending on the number of patients we ultimately enroll in our trials, and the number of trials we may need to conduct, our overall clinical trial costs may be higher than

	Our product candidates are biologics and the process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly-regulated and subject to multiple risks. The manufacture

<I>
	ex vivo,
</I>
	multiplying the T cells to obtain the desired dose, and ultimately infusing the T cells back into a
	patient&#146;s body. As a result of the complexities, the cost to manufacture biologics in general, and our genetically modified cell product candidates in particular, is generally higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the
	manufacturing process is less reliable and is more difficult to reproduce. Our manufacturing process will be susceptible to product loss or failure due to logistical issues associated with the collection of white blood cells, or starting material,
	from the patient, shipping such material to the manufacturing site, shipping the final product back to the patient, and infusing the patient with the product, manufacturing issues associated with the differences in patient starting materials,

	stability issues, lot consistency, and timely availability of reagents or raw materials. As a result of these challenges, we may experience delays in our clinical development and/or commercialization plans. We may ultimately be unable to reduce the

	comply with GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial
	sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign
	regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional nonclinical or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical

	comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates

	Cancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first line, second line, or third line, and the
	FDA often approves new therapies initially only for third line use. When cancer is detected early enough, first line therapy is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Whenever first line therapy, usually chemotherapy,
	hormone therapy, surgery, or a combination of these, proves unsuccessful, second line therapy may be administered. Second line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs, tumor targeted small molecules, or a combination
	of these. Third line therapies can include bone marrow transplantation, antibody and small molecule targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery, and new technologies. We expect to initially seek approval of our product candidates as a third
	line therapy for patients who have failed other approved treatments. Subsequently, for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial, if any, we would expect to seek approval as a second line therapy and potentially as a first line
	therapy, but there is no guarantee that our product candidates, even if approved, would be approved for second line or first line therapy. In addition, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials prior to gaining approval for second line or

	Our projections of both the number of people who have the cancers we are targeting, as well as the subset of people with these

	scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations, or market research and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers. The number of patients may turn out to be lower
	than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates. For instance, with our CD19 product candidates we expect to
	initially target a small patient population that suffers from ALL and certain types of aggressive NHL. Even if we obtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve

	The biopharmaceutical industry, and the rapidly evolving market for developing
	genetically engineered T cells in particular, is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors
	include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and
	other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations as well as established sales forces. Smaller or early- stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors,
	particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may
	increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing,
	acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized, or less costly than our product candidates or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we
	may need for the development of our technologies and products.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Specifically, genetically engineering T cells faces significant competition in both the
	CAR and TCR technology space from multiple companies and their collaborators, such as Novartis / Penn, Kite Pharma / Amgen / NCI, Cellectis / Pfizer / Servier, Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson / Transposagen Biopharmaceuticals, bluebird bio, Bellicum,
	Celyad, NantKwest, Intrexon / Ziopharm / MD Anderson Cancer Center, Unum Therapeutics, Adaptimmune / GlaxoSmithKline, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, and Autolus. We also face competition from non-cell based treatments offered by companies such as
	Amgen, Pfizer, Abbvie, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Incyte, Merck, and Roche. For instance, in 2014 the FDA approved Amgen&#146;s blinotumomab for the treatment of r/r ALL, and that product has achieved a CR rate of approximately 40% in clinical
	trials. We also anticipate Pfizer&#146;s inotuzumab to be approved for the treatment of r/r ALL as early as 2016, which has shown a CR rate of approximately 80% in clinical trials.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Even if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we may not be the first to market and that may affect the price or demand for our product
	candidates. Additionally, the availability and price of our competitors&#146; products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our
	product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our
	product candidates for use in limited circumstances. Additionally, a competitor could obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA with respect to such competitor&#146;s product. If such competitor product is determined to be the same product as
	one of our product candidates, that may prevent us from obtaining approval from the FDA for such product candidate for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances.

	specified threshold values ascending, in the case of FHCRC, from $20.00 per share to $160.00 per share and, in the case of MSK, from $40.00 per share to $120.00 per share, in each case subject to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split,
	combination of shares, or other similar events. Each threshold is associated with a success payment, ascending, in the case of FHCRC, from $10&nbsp;million at $20.00 per share to $375&nbsp;million at $160.00 per share and, in the case of MSK, from
	$10&nbsp;million at $40.00 per share to $150&nbsp;million at $120.00 per share, payable if such threshold is reached. The maximum aggregate amount of success payments to FHCRC is $375&nbsp;million and to MSK is $150 million, in each case subject to
	certain indirect cost offsets related to our cash payments for collaboration activities. In December 2015, success payments to FHCRC were triggered in the aggregate amount of $75.0 million, less indirect cost offsets of $3.3 million, and a success
	payment to MSK was triggered in the amount of $10.0 million, less indirect cost offsets that will be determined at the time of payment in March 2016. We elected to make the payment to FHCRC in shares of our common stock, and thereby issued 1,601,085
	shares of our common stock to FHCRC in December 2015. The MSK success payment is required to be made, in cash or shares of our common stock at our election, on March&nbsp;18, 2016. See the section captioned &#147;Licenses and Third-Party

	In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third- party
	payors. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and
	cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates
	might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations
	required following the use of our genetically modified products. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our product candidates.
	Because our product candidates have a higher cost of goods than conventional therapies, and may require long- term follow up evaluations, the risk that coverage and reimbursement rates may be inadequate for us to achieve profitability may be
	greater.

	We intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the United States and in selected foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain
	approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions for our product candidates, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some foreign countries, particularly those in the EU, the pricing of biologics is subject to
	governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining marketing approval of a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates
	will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures.

	Third-party payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of
	controlling healthcare costs. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In
	particular, in 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the
	Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug
	Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that
	increase the federal government&#146;s comparative effectiveness research.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the
	United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with
	recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes
	aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is
	taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of
	limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

	Patents relating to our product candidates are controlled by certain of our licensors. Each of our
	licensors generally has rights to file, prosecute, maintain, and defend the patents we have licensed from such licensor. We generally have the first right to enforce our patent rights, although our ability to settle such claims often requires the
	consent of the licensor. If our licensors or any future licensees having rights to file, prosecute, maintain, and defend our patent rights fail to conduct these activities for patents or patent applications covering any of our product candidates,
	our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using, or selling competing products. We cannot be certain that such activities by our licensors
	have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property rights. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreements with some of our licensors, the
	licensors may have the right to control enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents and, even if we are permitted to pursue such enforcement or defense, we cannot ensure the cooperation of
	our licensors. We cannot be certain that our licensors will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize their or our enforcement of such patents or defense of such claims to protect our interests in the licensed patents. Even if we are not a party
	to these legal actions, an adverse outcome could harm our business because it might prevent us from continuing to license intellectual property that we may need to operate our business. In addition, even when we have the right to control patent
	prosecution of licensed patents and patent applications, enforcement of licensed patents, or defense of claims asserting the invalidity of those patents, we may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensors and

	We own or license from third parties certain intellectual property rights

	require the use of additional proprietary rights held by third parties. Our product candidates may also require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently. These formulations may be covered by intellectual property rights held by
	others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any relevant third-party intellectual property rights that we identify as necessary or important to our business operations. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on
	reasonable terms, if at all, which would harm our business. We may need to cease use of the compositions or methods covered by such third-party intellectual property rights, and may need to seek to develop alternative approaches that do not infringe
	on such intellectual property rights which may entail additional costs and development delays, even if we were able to develop such alternatives, which may not be feasible. Even if we are able to obtain a license under such intellectual property

	institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property or to maintain the existing
	intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of such program and our business and financial condition could suffer.

	validity, enforceability, or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. For example, on August&nbsp;13, 2015, Kite Pharma filed a petition
	with the USPTO for inter partes review of U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;7,446,190, a patent that we have exclusively licensed from MSK. If Kite Pharma is successful in the resulting proceedings at the USPTO, the patent could be narrowed or invalidated.
	Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing their products to avoid being covered by our claims. If the breadth or strength of
	protection provided by the patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, this could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and could threaten our ability to commercialize, our product
	candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. Because patent applications in the United States and most other
	countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, for U.S. applications in which all claims are entitled to a
	priority date before March&nbsp;16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. For
	U.S. applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March&nbsp;16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law in view of the passage of the America Invents Act, which brought into effect significant changes to
	the U.S. patent laws, including new procedures for challenging pending patent applications and issued patents.

	Although we have conducted analyses of the patent landscape with respect to our CD19 product candidates, and based on these analyses, we believe that we will
	be able to commercialize our CD19 product candidates, third parties may nonetheless assert that we infringe their patents, or that we are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization, and may sue us. For instance, Novartis
	Pharmaceutical Corporation has asserted in writing its belief that we infringe the following patents controlled by Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,408,053, 7,205,101, 7,527,925, and 7,442,525. There may be third-party patents
	of which we are currently unaware with claims to compositions, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods of use or treatment that cover our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently
	pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies or the manufacture, use, or sale of our
	product candidates infringes upon these patents. If any such third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover our technologies or product candidates, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to
	commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Such a license may not be available on commercially

	As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing

	Even if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate faster than our competitors, we may face
	competition from biosimilars. In the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be &#147;highly similar,&#148; or biosimilar, to
	or &#147;interchangeable&#148; with an FDA-approved biological product. This new pathway could allow competitors to reference data from innovative biological products 12 years after the time of approval of the innovative biological product. This
	data exclusivity does not prevent another company from developing a product that is highly similar to the innovative product, generating its own data, and seeking approval. Data exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely upon the data
	within the innovator&#146;s application to support the biosimilar product&#146;s approval. In his proposed budget for fiscal year 2014, President Obama proposed to cut this 12-year period of exclusivity down to seven years. He also proposed to
	prohibit additional periods of exclusivity due to minor changes in product formulations, a practice often referred to as &#147;evergreening.&#148; It is possible that Congress may take these or other measures to reduce or eliminate periods of
	exclusivity. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning is subject to uncertainty. Although it

	In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific
	guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In Europe, a competitor may reference data supporting approval of an innovative biological product, but will not be able to get it on the market until 10 years after the time of
	approval of the innovative product. This 10-year marketing exclusivity period will be extended to 11 years if, during the first eight of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an approval for one or more new therapeutic

	The stock market in general, and market prices for the securities of biopharmaceutical companies like ours in
	particular, have from time to time experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the underlying companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock,
	regardless of our operating performance. In several recent situations when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of
	our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit against us, the defense and disposition of the lawsuit could be costly and divert the time and attention of our management and harm our operating results.

	Prior to our initial public offering in December 2014, there was no public market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ
	Global Select Market, the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity. Furthermore, an active trading market may not be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market may impair investors&#146; ability to sell
	their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, may reduce the market value of their shares and may impair our ability to raise capital.

	In August 2015, Kite Pharma filed a petition with the USPTO for inter partes review of U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;7,446,190,
	a patent that we have exclusively licensed from MSK. In February 2016, the USPTO determined to initiate the inter partes review proceedings, in
<I>
	Kite Pharma, Inc. v. Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research
</I>
	, Case IPR2015-01719. As the
	exclusive licensor, we have opted to exercise our right to control the defense of the patent in the proceedings. We will incur expenses associated with this defense, which expenses may be substantial. If we are unsuccessful, the patent could be
	narrowed or invalidated, but we do not expect that this would have a material adverse effect on our business.

	There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in the Registration Statement. We invested the
	funds received in short-term, interest-bearing investment-grade securities and government securities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have used approximately $217.9 million of the net proceeds from the IPO primarily to fund the costs to advance
	JCAR015 through a Phase II clinical trial, to advance JCAR017 through a Phase I clinical trial and into a potential registration trial in relapsed/refractory NHL, to further develop additional product candidates, to expand our internal research and
	development capabilities, to establish manufacturing capabilities, to acquire, license and invest in complementary products, technologies and businesses, and other general corporate purposes. None of the offering proceeds were paid directly or
	indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates) or persons owning 10.0% or more of any class of our equity securities or to any other affiliates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are building a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on re-engaging the body&#146;s immune system to revolutionize the treatment of cancer.
	Founded on the vision that the use of human cells as therapeutic entities will drive one of the next important phases in medicine, we are developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on our CAR and high-affinity TCR technologies to genetically
	engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. We have shown compelling clinical responses in clinical trials using multiple cell-based product candidates to address refractory B cell lymphomas and leukemias, and we also have a number of
	ongoing trials exploring our platform in solid-organ cancers and in combination with various strategies to overcome the immune-suppressive effects of cancer. Longer term, we aim to improve and leverage our cell-based platform to develop additional
	product candidates to address a broad range of cancers and human diseases, including moving forward our pre-clinical product candidates that target additional hematologic and solid-organ cancers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the third quarter of 2015, we began a Phase II trial of JCAR015 that could support accelerated U.S. regulatory approval in adult r/r B cell ALL as early as
	2017. We also began a Phase I trial with JCAR017 in adult r/r aggressive B cell NHL, with the potential to move to a registration trial for that product candidate in 2016 or early 2017. We are continuing to enroll patients in an ongoing Phase I/II
	trial for JCAR014 in B cell malignancies, and although we do not plan to move JCAR014 into registration trials, we plan to use this trial to explore important questions that may improve our platform overall. To date, data from the JCAR014 trial have
	provided encouraging early insights on how to improve our efficacy and safety in patients with ALL, NHL, and CLL. The IND has cleared for and we plan to enroll patients through 2016 in a Phase Ib clinical trial combining JCAR014 with
	MedImmune&#146;s investigational PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, for the treatment of adult r/r B cell NHL. We have also begun Phase I trials for five additional product candidates that target different cancer-associated proteins in
	hematological and solid organ cancers. We also expect to commence a Phase I trial through our collaborator MSK of a CD19/4-1BBL &#147;armored&#148; CAR in 2016 and a Phase I trial for one or both of CD19/CD40L and CD19/IL-12 &#147;armored&#148; CARs
	in 2016 or 2017.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that the quality of our people will have a strong and positive impact on our ability to develop and capitalize on our
	technology. In that vein we have assembled a talented group of scientists, engineers, clinicians, directors, and other advisors who develop and consolidate technologies and intellectual property from some of the world&#146;s leading research
	institutions, including FHCRC, MSK, SCRI, and the NCI. Our scientific founders and their institutions include world leaders in oncology, immunology, and cell therapy, and they actively contribute towards developing our product candidates and
	technologies. Collectively, these stakeholders share our commitment to bringing our product candidates to market and our vision of revolutionizing medicine through developing a broadly applicable cell-based platform. We have also entered into a
	number of strategic collaborations with commercial companies that we believe will help us manufacture and commercialize our product candidates around the world or develop additional or improved product candidates, including Celgene, Editas, Fate
	Therapeutics, and MedImmune.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	in implementing enhancements to product candidates. In turn, these improvements may lead to a lower cost of manufacturing, streamlined regulatory reviews, greater convenience for patients and
	physicians, and better patient outcomes. We have used CMOs to provide speed, flexibility and limit upfront capital investment in manufacturing, and successfully brought a CMO on-line to manufacture JCAR015. We have also established a Juno-run
	manufacturing facility in Bothell, Washington. We plan to manufacture clinical trial material from this facility beginning in the first quarter of 2016, and commercial products, subject to the required regulatory approvals, beginning in 2017, with
	the goal of improving long-term margins and enabling more rapid implementation of innovative changes.

	In June 2015 we entered into a ten-year, global
	collaboration agreement with Celgene Corporation for the development and commercialization of immunotherapies. In connection with this collaboration agreement, Celgene paid us a $150 million upfront payment, and under a Share Purchase Agreement, we
	sold Celgene 9,137,672 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash price of approximately $850 million, or $93.00 per share.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May 2015, we acquired Stage, a company focused on developing technology platforms, including novel reagents and automation technologies, that enable the
	development and production of cell therapeutics. The acquisition of Stage is intended to provide us access to transformative cell selection and activation capabilities, next generation manufacturing automation technologies, enhanced control of our
	supply chain, and lower expected long-term cost of goods.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2015, we acquired X-Body, a company focused on the discovery of human monoclonal
	antibodies and discovery of TCR binding domains. The X-Body acquisition is intended to augment our capabilities to create&nbsp;best-in-class&nbsp;engineered T cells against a broad array of cancer targets.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In January 2016, we acquired AbVitro, a company with a leading next-generation single cell sequencing platform. The AbVitro acquisition is intended to augment
	our capabilities to create&nbsp;best-in-class&nbsp;engineered T cells against a broad array of cancer targets. We and Celgene have agreed in principle to enter into an agreement to license Celgene a subset of the acquired technology and to grant
	Celgene options to certain related potential product rights emanating from the acquired technology.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we generated revenue of
	$5.1 million from the Celgene Collaboration Agreement. In addition, we generated revenue of $12.3 million in 2015 from an upfront license payment in connection with the Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement entered into in April 2015. In the future, we
	may generate revenue from product sales, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result
	of the timing and amount of license fees, milestones, reimbursement of costs incurred and other payments and product sales, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a
	timely manner or obtain regulatory approval of them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have agreed to make success payments to each of FHCRC and MSK pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreements with each of those entities. In
	December 2015, success payment obligations to FHCRC were triggered in the amount of $75.0 million less indirect cost offsets of $3.3 million and to MSK of $10.0 million less indirect cost offsets that will be determined at the time of payment in
	March 2016. We elected to make the payment to FHCRC in shares of our common stock, and thereby issued 1,601,085 shares of our common stock to FHCRC in December 2015. The success payment obligation to MSK is required to be paid, in cash or shares of
	our common stock at our election, on March&nbsp;18, 2016. For additional information regarding these success payments, see the section captioned &#147;Licenses and Third-Party Collaborations&#148; in Part I&#151;Item 1&#151;&#147;Business&#148;

	The OPM treats the rights of the holders of preferred and common stock as equivalent to call options on the value of the enterprise above certain break points of value

	the value of the liquidation preference(s) at the time of the liquidity event. The OPM uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model defines securities&#146; fair values as functions of the current fair value of a company and uses
	assumptions, such as the anticipated timing of a potential liquidity event, the estimated applicable risk-free rate, and the estimated volatility of the equity securities.

	Under the terms of our collaboration agreement with FHCRC, we granted FHCRC the right to receive certain share-based success payments, payable in cash or
	publicly-traded equity at our discretion. These success payments are based on increases in the estimated fair value of our common stock, with such payments determined upon, and payable following, certain events (valuation measurement dates) during
	the term of the success payment agreement, in each case as described in more detail in the section captioned &#147;Licenses and Third-Party Collaborations&#148; in Part I&#151;Item 1&#151;&#147;Business&#148; of this report. The amount of a success
	payment is determined based on whether the value of our common stock meets or exceeds certain specified threshold values ascending from $20.00 per share to $160.00 per share, in each case subject to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split,
	combination of shares, or other similar events. Each threshold is associated with a success payment, ascending from $10 million at $20.00 per share to $375 million at $160.00 per share, payable if such threshold is reached. Any previous success
	payments made to FHCRC are credited against the success payment owed as of any valuation measurement date, so that FHCRC does not receive multiple success payments in connection with the same threshold. The success payments to FHCRC are not to
	exceed, in aggregate, $375 million, which would only be owed when the value of the common stock reaches $160.00 per share. In June 2014, we entered into an agreement with FHCRC in which certain indirect costs related to the collaboration projects
	conducted by FHCRC are creditable against any success payments, and we amended this agreement in December 2015. See Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report for a summary of the value of success payments

	the subsequent closings of the Series A and Series A-2 convertible preferred stock financings, the estimated fair value of the Series A and A-2 convertible preferred stock was greater than the issuance price per share of $4.00. For financial
	reporting purposes, the estimated fair value of the Series A and Series A-2 convertible preferred stock at these closing dates was derived taking into account numerous valuation factors, including, but not limited to, retrospective valuations
	performed by independent third party valuation firms, our stage of development, capital resources, current business plans, likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, and the rights, preferences, and privileges of our Series A and Series A-2
	convertible preferred stock compared to the rights, preferences and privileges of our other outstanding equity securities. The differences between the estimated fair value of the Series A and Series A-2 convertible preferred stock shares as of the
	respective closing dates and the issuance prices of the shares were deemed to be equivalent to preferred stock dividends. As a result, we recorded deemed dividends of $67.5 million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The deemed dividends were
	recorded as an increase in convertible preferred stock of $67.5 million, a decrease in additional paid-in capital of $16.4 million, and an increase in accumulated deficit of $51.1 million. The deemed dividends increased the net loss attributable to
	common stockholders by $67.5 million in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. All of the Series A and Series A-2 convertible preferred stock converted to common stock in connection
	with our initial public offering.

	Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. Excluding amounts attributable to changes in the estimated
	fair value of the success payment and contingent consideration liabilities and upfront fees to acquire technology, we expect our research and development expenses to increase over the next several years as we implement our business strategy which
	includes conducting existing and new clinical trials, manufacturing clinical trial and preclinical study materials, expanding our research and development and process development efforts, seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates that
	successfully complete clinical trials, and costs associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. Research and development expense related to our success payments is unpredictable and may vary
	significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to changes in our stock price or other assumptions used in the calculation. A significant decline in the estimated value of the success payment liability may result in a gain and possibly
	net income during the period. Amounts associated with the change in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities also may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to changes in our assumptions used in
	the calculation. In addition, we expect to incur research and development expense for acquisition of technology in the future, but the timing and amount of those expenses cannot be estimated with reliability and may also fluctuate from quarter to
	quarter and year to year.

	. Research and development expenses were $205.2 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, compared to $204.5
	million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Excluding expense related to our success payment liability, research and development expenses were $153.6 million and $119.6 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014,
	respectively. The increase of $34.0 million was primarily due to an increase of $71.9 million in expenses attributable to efforts to expand the company&#146;s overall research and development capabilities and advance programs at our founding
	institutions, which expenses include personnel costs, manufacturing costs in support of our clinical trials, lab supplies, clinical and research costs under our collaboration agreements and in support of our company-sponsored clinical trials, costs
	incurred by our German subsidiary, consulting, and facilities and allocated overhead costs and an increase of $14.2 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, of which $4.6 million is related to a former co-founding director who became a
	consultant upon his departure from the board of directors. These increases were partially offset by lower costs to acquire technology of $51.0 million. In 2015 we incurred upfront fees of $30.8 million in connection with technology acquired from the
	Editas and Fate Therapeutics transactions, and in 2014 we incurred a non-cash upfront fee of $64.1 million and a cash upfront fee of $20.0 million to acquire technology related to JCAR018.

	Expense related to our success payment liability for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 was $51.6 million and $84.9 million, respectively. The

	$11.3 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, expenses related to the Celgene, Stage, X-Body, and other business development transactions of $9.7 million, increased costs of $4.9 million incurred to support the business including

	As
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Prior to our entry into the Celgene collaboration, we raised an aggregate of approximately $618.0 million in gross proceeds, through our IPO and
	private placements of our convertible preferred stock which we have used to fund our operations. As a result of our entry into the collaboration with Celgene and our initial sale of stock to Celgene, we received $1.0 billion in cash from Celgene in
	August 2015. Celgene also has the right to purchase additional shares of our common stock, including annual &#147;top-up&#148; rights as described under &#147;Licenses and Third-Party Collaborations&#148; in Part I&#151;Item
	1&#151;&#147;Business&#148; elsewhere in this report. If exercised, these purchases will provide us with additional funding for our operations. This funding decreases our need for additional near term funding, although we may still need to raise
	additional capital in the future. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.

	We expect to continue to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we expand our research and
	development activities and build our commercial infrastructure. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, and if funding from Celgene is not sufficient for our operations, we may be required to finance our cash needs
	through a combination of equity or debt financings. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interests of our
	stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities,
	these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If we raise additional
	funds through additional collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are
	unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we
	would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

	upon future events such as our achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, or royalties on net product sales. See the section captioned &#147;Licenses and Third-Party Collaborations&#148; in Part I&#151;Item
	1&#151;&#147;Business&#148; of this report for more information about these payment obligations. As described above under the caption &#147;Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates&#151;Success Payments,&#148; we are also
	obligated to make up to $300.0 million in success payments to FHCRC and up to $140.0 million in success payments to MSK based on increases in the estimated fair value of our common stock. Both of these obligations are payable in cash or stock, at
	our election. In December 2015, success payment obligations to FHCRC were triggered in the amount of $75.0 million less indirect cost offsets of $3.3 million and to MSK of $10.0 million less indirect cost offsets that will be determined at the time
	of payment in March 2016. We elected to make the payment to FHCRC in shares of our common stock, and thereby issued 1,601,085 shares of our common stock to FHCRC in December 2015. The success payment obligation to MSK is required to be paid, in cash
	or shares of our common stock at our election, on March&nbsp;18, 2016. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we were unable to estimate the timing or likelihood of achieving the milestones or generating future product sales and therefore, any related
	payments are not included in the table above.

	Under the new guidance, companies are required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. ASU No.&nbsp;2015-17 is effective for periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
	with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this standard for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operation or related financial statement

	In 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will replace all current GAAP guidance on
	this topic and establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance can be
	applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date to January&nbsp;1, 2018 with early adoption permitted beginning
	January&nbsp;1, 2017. We are evaluating the method we will use to adopt the new standard and the impact on our consolidated financial statements.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had $963.9 million in marketable securities, largely composed of investment grade short- to intermediate-term
	fixed income securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital to fund our operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our objectives, we maintain

	Our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could fall

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the estimated fair value of

	The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of
	the success payments are subject to a significant amount of judgment including the expected volatility, estimated term, and estimated number and timing of valuation measurement dates. A small change in the assumptions may have a relatively large
	change in the estimated valuation and associated liability and expense. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a hypothetical 10% increase in the stock price at December&nbsp;31, 2015 from $43.97 per share to $48.37 per share would have
	increased the expense recorded in 2015 associated with the success payment liability by $7.7 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the stock price from $43.97 per share to $39.57 per share would have decreased the expense recorded in 2015
	associated with the success payment liability by $7.6 million. Further, keeping all other variables constant, a hypothetical 35% increase in the stock price at December&nbsp;31, 2015 from $43.97 per share to $59.36 per share would have increased the
	expense recorded in 2015 associated with the success payment liability by $27.3 million. A hypothetical 35% decrease in the stock price from $43.97 per share to $28.58 per share would have decreased the expense recorded in 2015 associated with the

	The majority of our transactions occur in U.S. dollars. However, we do have certain transactions and future potential milestones, including potential
	contingent consideration payments pursuant to the terms of our Stage acquisition, that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk. Additionally, our subsidiary
	Juno Therapeutics GmbH, which we acquired in May 2015, operates with the Euro as its functional currency. The fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Euro affects the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As
	we expand our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations will increase. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated

	on re-engaging the body&#146;s immune system to revolutionize the treatment of cancer. Founded on the vision that the use of human cells as therapeutic entities will drive one of the next important phases in medicine, the Company is developing
	cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on its chimeric antigen receptor (&#147;CAR&#148;) and high-affinity T cell receptor (&#147;TCR&#148;) technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells.

	In May 2015, the Company acquired all the remaining ownership interests in Stage Cell Therapeutics GmbH (&#147;Stage&#148;) not already held by it. See Note
	3, Acquisitions. As a result of the acquisition, Stage has become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the results of Stage have been consolidated with the Company&#146;s results since the date of the acquisition. Stage has operations in
	G&ouml;ttingen and Munich, Germany and its operations are focused on developing technology platforms, including novel reagents and automation technologies that enable the development and production of cell therapeutics. Stage has been renamed as

	developing new technological innovations, the need to successfully commercialize and gain market acceptance of the Company&#146;s products, protection of proprietary technology, and the need to obtain adequate additional funding. If the Company, or
	any commercialization partner for the Company&#146;s product candidates, does not successfully commercialize any of the Company&#146;s product candidates, the Company will not be able to generate product revenue or achieve profitability. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $585.7 million.

	In February 2015, the Company entered into a lease for a manufacturing facility, which commenced in March 2015. The Company is responsible for the leasehold
	improvements required to remodel the facility and it bore the majority of the construction risk. Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting Standard Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 840-40,
<I>
	Leases&#151;Sale-Leaseback
	Transactions (Subsection 05-5)

	, required the Company to be considered the owner of the building solely for accounting purposes, even though it was not the legal owner. As a result, the Company recorded an asset and build-to-suit lease obligation
	on its balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 equal to the fair value of the building at the inception of the lease.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Construction was completed in
	the first quarter of 2016, and the Company considered the requirements for sale-leaseback accounting treatment, including evaluating whether all risks of ownership have transferred back to the landlord, as evidenced by a lack of continuing
	involvement in the leased property. The Company determined that the arrangement does not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting treatment and the building asset will remain on its balance sheet at its historical cost, and such asset will be
	depreciated over its estimated useful life. The Company bifurcates the lease payments into a portion allocated to the building and a portion allocated to the parcel of land on which the building has been built. The portion of the lease payments
	allocated to the land is treated for accounting purposes as operating lease payments, and therefore is recorded as rent expense in the statements of operations. The portion of the lease payments allocated to the building is further bifurcated into a
	portion allocated to interest expense and a portion allocated to reduce the build-to-suit lease obligation.

	The Company regularly reviews the carrying value and estimated lives of its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, to determine whether

	operations and positive cash flow in future periods as well as the strategic significance of the asset to the Company&#146;s business objectives. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess of the

	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
	measured at fair value. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and upon the occurrence of triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that could indicate a potential impairment by assessing
	qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the net assets are below their carrying amounts.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are initially recognized at their fair value at the
	acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Intangible assets related to in-process research and development (&#147;IPR&amp;D&#148;) are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and not amortized until they become definite lived assets
	upon certain regulatory approval in specified markets, typically either the U.S. or the EU in the case of X-Body, and in the case of Stage, when the acquired reagents or automation technology is accepted by the FDA as part of an Investigational New
	Drug (&#147;IND&#148;) filing, subject to management judgment. At that time, the Company will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at

	Pursuant to certain 2013 and 2014 convertible preferred stock purchase agreements, the Company had the right to sell, or &#147;put,&#148; additional shares of
	Series A and A-2 convertible preferred stock in subsequent closings as well as potential obligations to issue additional shares upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company assessed its rights and potential obligations to sell additional
	shares and determined them to be a single unit of accounting, with classification outside of equity in accordance with ASC 480,
<I>
	Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
</I>
	. As of each balance sheet date, the fair value of these combined

	rate.

	The Company recorded these combined instruments as convertible preferred stock options as of the date of the initial closings of the Series A
	convertible preferred stock financing and Series A-2 convertible preferred stock financing. The options were revalued to fair value at each subsequent balance sheet date, with fair value changes recognized as increases or reductions to other income
	(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company estimated the fair value of these instruments based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. These options were exercised during 2014. For the year ended December&nbsp;31,
	2014, $10.7 million was recognized in other expense related to the changes in fair value of these options.

	As of the dates of the second tranche closing and third tranche closing of the Series A-2
	convertible preferred stock financing in June and July 2014, the estimated fair value of the Series A-2 convertible preferred stock was $5.96 and $7.88 per share, respectively, compared with the purchase price per share of $4.00. As of the date of
	the final closing of the Series A convertible preferred stock financing in July 2014, the estimated fair value of the Series A convertible preferred stock was $8.36 per share compared with the purchase price per share of $4.00. The differences
	between the estimated fair value as of the closing dates and the purchase prices were deemed to be equivalent to a preferred stock dividend. As a result, the Company recorded deemed dividends of $15.4 million, $30.3 million, and $21.8 million for
	the Series A-2 second tranche closing, Series A-2 third tranche closing, and Series A final closing, respectively, in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The deemed dividends increased convertible preferred stock by $67.5 million, reduced

	Success payment liabilities are estimated at fair value at inception and at each subsequent balance sheet date
	and the expense is amortized using the accelerated attribution method over the remaining term (service period) of the related collaboration agreement or related possible payment due date (whichever is sooner). To determine the estimated fair value
	of the success payments the Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation methodology which models the future movement of stock prices based on several key variables. The following variables were incorporated in the estimated fair value of the success
	payment liability: estimated term of the success payments, fair value of common stock, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, estimated number and timing of valuation measurement dates on the basis of which payments may be triggered, and
	certain estimated indirect costs creditable against the success payments are also included in the calculation. The computation of expected volatility was estimated using a combination of available information about the historical volatility of
	stocks of similar publicly-traded companies for a period matching the expected term assumption and its historical and projected volatility. In addition, prior to the Company becoming publicly traded there was one valuation measurement date on the
	basis of which payments may be triggered. There are several valuation measurement dates subsequent to the IPO on the basis of which payments may be triggered.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2015, success payments to FHCRC were triggered in the aggregate amount of $75.0 million, less indirect cost offsets of $3.3 million. The Company
	elected to make the payment in shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, and thereby issued 1,601,085 shares of common stock to FHCRC in December 2015. In December 2015, a success payment to MSK was triggered in the amount of $10.0 million, which
	is required to be paid, less indirect cost offsets that will be determined at the time of payment, in March 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014,
	the estimated fair value of the success payment obligation after giving effect to the success payments achieved by FHCRC and MSK was approximately $116.2 million and $195.9 million, respectively. The Company recognized research and development
	expense of $51.6 million and $84.9 million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with respect to the success payment obligations. The success payment liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December&nbsp;31,
	2015 and 2014 were $64.8 million and $84.9 million, respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the success payments are subject to
	a significant amount of judgment including the expected volatility, estimated term, and estimated number and timing of valuation measurement dates. A small change in the assumptions may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation and
	associated liability and expense. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a hypothetical 10% increase in the stock price at December&nbsp;31, 2015 from $43.97 per share to $48.37 per share would have increased the expense recorded in 2015
	associated with the success payment liability by $7.7 million. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the stock price from $43.97 per share to $39.57 per share would have decreased the expense recorded in 2015 associated with the success payment liability
	by $7.6 million. Further, keeping all other variables constant, a hypothetical 35% increase in the stock price at December&nbsp;31, 2015 from $43.97 per share to $59.36 per share would have increased the expense recorded in 2015 associated with the
	success payment liability by $27.3 million. A hypothetical 35% decrease in the stock price from $43.97 per share to $28.58 per share would have decreased the expense recorded in 2015 associated with the success payment liability by $25.7 million.

	The Company analyzes agreements with more than one element, or deliverable, based on the guidance in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element
	Arrangements (&#147;ASC 605-25&#148;). The Company identifies the deliverables within the agreement and evaluates which deliverables represent separate units of accounting. Analyzing the agreement to identify deliverables requires the use of
	judgment. A deliverable is considered a separate unit of accounting when the deliverable has value to the collaborator or licensee on a standalone basis based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In assessing whether an item has standalone value, the Company considers factors such as the research, manufacturing, and commercialization capabilities of
	the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the other deliverable(s) can be used for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining
	element(s), whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item(s) and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered element(s).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Consideration received is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified units of accounting based on the relative selling prices. The relative
	selling price for each deliverable is estimated using objective evidence if it is available. If objective evidence is not available, the Company uses its best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable. Management may be required to exercise
	considerable judgment in estimating the selling prices of identified units of accounting under its agreements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Options for future deliverables are
	considered substantive if, at the inception of the arrangement, the Company is at risk as to whether the collaboration partner will choose to exercise the option. Factors that the Company considers in evaluating whether an option is substantive
	include the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, the cost to exercise the option and the likelihood that the option will be exercised. For arrangements
	under which an option is considered substantive, the Company does not consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and the associated option fees are not included in the initial consideration,
	assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount. Conversely, for arrangements under which an option is not considered substantive or if an option is priced at a significant and incremental discount, the Company would
	consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and a corresponding amount would be included in the initial consideration.

	Stock-based compensation expense for

	stock-based compensation expense for its awards. The Company&#146;s forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of its actual forfeitures since the adoption of its equity award plan. Since inception the Company&#146;s estimated forfeiture rate has been

	The Company also granted restricted stock awards that vest in conjunction with certain performance conditions to certain key employees, scientific founders,

	of accomplishing each performance provision. Compensation expense is measured using the fair value of the award at the grant date, net of forfeitures, and is adjusted annually to reflect actual forfeitures.

	In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) No.&nbsp;2015-17,
<I>
	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
	Taxes (Topic 740)
</I>
	, intended to improve how deferred taxes are classified on organizations&#146; balance sheets. The new guidance eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a
	classified balance sheet. Under the new guidance, companies are required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. ASU No.&nbsp;2015-17 is effective for periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, and interim periods
	within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this standard for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operation
	or related financial statement disclosures.

	In 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. This new standard will
	replace all current GAAP guidance on this topic and establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those
	goods or services. This guidance can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date to January&nbsp;1, 2018 with
	early adoption permitted beginning January&nbsp;1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting the new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

	On May&nbsp;11, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of all the outstanding ownership interests in Stage not already held by it.
	Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 4.76% equity interest in Stage. As a result of the acquisition, Stage became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company paid &#128;52.5&nbsp;million, or $58.5 million, in cash and issued an
	aggregate of 486,279 shares of common stock, valued at $22.2 million based on the closing stock price on May&nbsp;11, 2015 of $45.58 per share, to the selling shareholders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company also agreed to pay additional amounts of up to an aggregate of &#128;135.0&nbsp;million in cash based on the achievement of certain technical,
	clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones related to novel reagents (&#128;40.0 million), advanced automation technology (&#128;65.0 million), and Stage&#146;s existing clinical pipeline (&#128;30.0 million). The fair value of this contingent

	to the first product with certain specified binding properties (a &#147;Type Y Product&#148;); and $20.0 million upon the achievement, during a specified period, of a clinical milestone related to the first product with certain other specified
	binding properties. If a Type X Product or a Type Y Product is commercialized, Juno can choose either to make a commercialization milestone payment for such a product or to pay a low single-digit royalty on net sales of such a product. The fair

	The fair value of the acquired in-process research and development has been estimated using the replacement cost method. Under
	this method, the Company estimated the cost to recreate the technology and derived an estimated value to develop the technology. In-process research and development are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until they become definite
	lived assets upon the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated research and development effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets will not be amortized until regulatory approval
	is obtained in a major market, typically either the United States or the EU, subject to management judgment. At that time, the Company will determine the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. If the associated research and development
	effort is abandoned, the related in-process research and development assets will be written-off and an impairment charge recorded.

	the acquisition furthers the Company&#146;s strategy of investing in technologies that augment the Company&#146;s capabilities to create best-in-class engineered T cells against a broad array of cancer targets. The acquisition brings in-house to the
	Company an innovative discovery platform that interrogates the human antibody repertoire, rapidly selecting fully human antibodies with desired characteristics, even against difficult targets. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for

	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
	assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and upon the occurrence of triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that could indicate a potential
	impairment by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of net assets are below their carrying amounts. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year

	Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are initially recognized at

	regulatory approval in specified markets in the case of X-Body, and in the case of Stage, when the acquired reagents or automation technology is accepted by the FDA as part of an IND, subject to management judgment. At that time, the Company will
	determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of IPR&amp;D and begin amortization. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or if indicators of potential impairment exist. There was no impairment of

	the Company and Celgene agreed to collaborate on researching, developing, and commercializing novel cellular therapy product candidates and other immuno-oncology and immunology therapeutics, including, in particular, CAR and TCR product candidates.
	The Celgene Collaboration Agreement was amended and restated in August 2015. Pursuant to the collaboration, prior to the exercise of an option for a program, each of the Company and Celgene will conduct independent programs to research, develop, and
	commercialize such product candidates (including, in the case of the Company, its CD19 and CD22 programs). Each party has certain options to obtain either an exclusive license to develop and commercialize specified product candidates arising from
	specified types of programs conducted by the other party within the scope of the collaboration, or the right to participate in the co-development and co-commercialization of specified product candidates arising from such programs, in each case in

	arising out of such programs in certain countries, and each of Celgene and Company has the right to elect to participate in certain commercialization activities for products in such programs in territories where it is not leading commercialization
	of such product. The parties may exercise their options with respect to specified product candidates arising under programs within the scope of the collaboration until the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Celgene Collaboration
	Agreement (the &#147;Research Collaboration Term&#148;), subject to a tail period applicable to certain programs, for which options have not yet been exercised as of the expiration of the Research Collaboration Term.

	The Celgene Collaboration Agreement contains the following deliverables: (1)&nbsp;access to certain of the Company&#146;s technology through a non-exclusive,
	worldwide, royalty-free right and license to conduct certain activities under the collaboration, and (2)&nbsp;participation on various collaboration committees. The Company considered the provisions of the multiple-element arrangement guidance in
	determining how to recognize the revenue associated with the two deliverables. The Company has accounted for access to certain of the Company&#146;s technology and participation on various collaboration committees as a single unit of accounting
	because the two deliverables do not have standalone value and both obligations will be delivered throughout the estimated period of performance.

	Under
	the terms of the Celgene Collaboration Agreement, the Company received an upfront cash payment of $150.2 million. The Company has identified the initial consideration for the Celgene Collaboration Agreement, which is the best estimated selling
	price, as the $150.2 million upfront payment under the Celgene Collaboration Agreement. The Company determined that each of the identified deliverables have the same period of performance (the ten year research collaboration term) and have the same
	pattern of revenue recognition, ratably over the period of performance. As a result, the $150.2 million in arrangement consideration was recorded in deferred revenue and will be recognized over the ten year research collaboration term. The Company
	recognized revenue of $5.1 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 in connection with the Celgene Collaboration Agreement.

	The Company also
	evaluated its own options pertaining to Celgene&#146;s programs. If the Company exercises any of its options, it is required to make a payment equal to a percentage of the costs incurred by Celgene prior to the exercise of the option in connection
	with the research and development activities and regulatory activities for such development candidate. The percentage of costs to be paid varies based on the point in development of such product at the time the Company exercises its option. The
	Company will account for the payments as research and development expense upon the exercise of the related option. The Company determined that payments related to licenses that will be used in future research and development activities with no
	proven alternative future use at the time of acquisition by the Company should be expensed when incurred in accordance with the Company&#146;s accounting policy.

	instruments as these rights are not legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Company&#146;s common stock. In addition, the Company has further assessed whether the Top-Up Rights and Acquisition Rights should be accounted for as
	derivative instruments and determined that derivative accounting does not apply. The Company determined that the Top-Up Rights and Acquisition Rights are embedded and inseparable from the initial stock purchase and no subsequent remeasurement is

	The Company granted FHCRC
	rights to certain share-based success payments. Under the terms of this arrangement, the Company may be required to make success payments to FHCRC based on increases in the estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock. The potential
	payments are based on multiples of increased value ranging from 5x to 40x based on a comparison of the fair value of the common stock relative to its original $4.00 issuance price. The payments are based on whether the value of the Company&#146;s
	common stock meets or exceeds certain specified threshold values ascending from $20.00 per share to $160.00 per share, in each case subject to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, or other similar events. The
	aggregate success payments to FHCRC are not to exceed $375 million which would only occur at a stock valuation of $160.00 per share. In June 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with FHCRC in which it can offset certain indirect costs related
	to the collaboration projects conducted by FHCRC against any success payments. The term of the success payment agreement ranges from eight to eleven years depending upon when or if the company receives FDA approval of certain of its product
	candidates as specified in the agreement.

	The success payments will be owed if the value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the contractually specified valuation
	measurement dates during the term of the success payment agreement equals or exceeds the above outlined multiples. The valuation measurement dates are triggered by events which include an initial public offering of the Company&#146;s stock, a
	merger, an asset sale, or the sale of the majority of the shares held by certain of the Company&#146;s stockholders or the last day of the term of the success payment agreement. If a higher success payment tier is first met at the same time a lower
	tier is first met, both tiers will be owed. Any previous success payments made to FHCRC are credited against the success payment owed as of any valuation measurement date, so that FHCRC does not receive multiple success payments in connection with
	the same threshold. A payment may be triggered on the first anniversary of the closing of the IPO (or the date that is 90 days following such anniversary, at the Company&#146;s option, if the Company is contemplating a capital market transaction
	during such 90 day period). The value of any such success payment will be determined by the average trading price of a share of the Company&#146;s common stock over the consecutive 90-day period preceding such determination date.

	In December 2015, success payments to FHCRC were triggered in the aggregate amount of $75.0 million, less indirect cost offsets of $3.3 million. These success
	payments represent the success payments identified on the table above for the 5.0x, 7.5x, and 10.0x Multiple of Initial Equity Value triggers. The Company elected to make the payment in shares of its common stock, and thereby issued 1,601,085 shares

	The Company granted MSK rights to certain share-based success payments. Under the terms of this arrangement, the
	Company may be required to make success payments to MSK based on the increases in the estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock. The potential payments are based on multiples of increased value ranging from 10x to 30x based on a
	comparison of the fair value of the common stock relative to its original $4.00 issuance price. The payments are based on whether the value of the Company&#146;s common stock meets or exceeds certain specified threshold values ascending from $40.00
	per share to $120.00 per share, in each case subject to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, or other similar events. The aggregate success payments to MSK are not to exceed $150 million, which would only occur at a
	stock valuation of $120.00 per share. In October 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with MSK in which certain indirect costs related to certain clinical studies and research projects conducted by MSK are creditable against any success
	payments, and the Company amended this agreement in December 2015. The term of the success payment agreement ranges from eight to eleven years depending upon when or if the company receives FDA approval of certain of its product candidates as

	Penn/Novartis Sublicense Agreement, Novartis paid the Company an initial license fee of $12.3 million, which was recorded as revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. In addition, Novartis is also required to pay mid-single digit royalties
	on the U.S. net sales of products and services related to the disputed contract and patent claims (the &#147;Royalty Payments&#148;), a low double digit percentage of the royalties Novartis pays to Penn for global net sales of those products (the

	The Company evaluated its securities for other-than-temporary impairment and considers the decline in market value for the
	securities to be primarily attributable to current economic and market conditions. For the debt securities, it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities, and the Company does not intend to do so prior to
	the recovery of the amortized cost basis. The unrealized loss for equity securities is related to the Company&#146;s investment in Fate Therapeutics. The Company has evaluated the near-term prospects of the Fate Therapeutics investment in relation
	to the severity and duration of the impairment and based on that evaluation, the Company has the ability and intent to hold this investment until a recovery of fair value. Based on this analysis, these marketable securities were not considered to be
	other-than-temporarily impaired as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the estimated fair value of the success payment obligations after giving effect to the
	success payments achieved by FHCRC and MSK was approximately $116.2 million and $195.9 million, respectively. Included in research and development expense for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 were success payment expenses of $51.6
	million and $84.9 million, respectively. There was no expense in 2013 related to the success payments. See Note 4, Collaboration and License Agreements, for additional discussion of estimated fair value of the success payment obligations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company utilizes significant estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated success payment and contingent consideration liabilities and
	associated expense at each balance sheet date. A small change in the Company&#146;s stock price may have a relatively large change in the estimated fair value of the success payment liability and associated expense.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the acquisitions of Stage and X-Body, the Company also agreed to pay additional amounts based on the achievement of certain milestones.
	This contingent consideration is measured at fair value and is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of contingent consideration uses
	assumptions the Company believes would be made by a market participant. The Company assesses these estimates on an on-going basis as additional data impacting the assumptions is obtained.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Contingent consideration may change significantly as development progresses and additional data are obtained, impacting the Company&#146;s assumptions
	regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related milestones used to estimate the fair value of the liability and the timing in which they are expected to be achieved. In evaluating the fair value information, judgment is required to
	interpret the market data used to develop the estimates. The estimates of fair value may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. Accordingly, the use of different market assumptions and/or different
	valuation techniques could result in materially different fair value estimates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The significant unobservable inputs used in the measurement of fair value
	of the Company&#146;s contingent consideration are probabilities of successful achievement of the milestones, the period in which these milestones are expected to be achieved ranging from 2016 to 2043, and a discount rate of 17.0%. Significant
	increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. Significant increases or decreases in these other inputs would result in a significantly lower or
	higher fair value measurement, respectively.

	In February 2015, the Company entered into a lease for an approximately 68,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Bothell, Washington, which commenced in
	March 2015. The Company is responsible for the leasehold improvements required to remodel the facility and bears the majority of the construction risk. ASC 840-40, Leases&#151;Sale-Leaseback Transactions, requires the Company to be considered the
	owner of the building solely for accounting purposes during the construction period, even though it is not the legal owner. In connection with the accounting for this transaction, the Company capitalized $9.9 million as a build-to-suit property
	within property and equipment, net and recognized a corresponding build-to-suit lease obligation for the same amount.

	In December 2014, the Company&#146;s board of directors adopted the 2014 employee stock purchase plan (the &#147;ESPP&#148;). The ESPP is administered by the
	Company&#146;s board of directors or by a committee appointed by the board of directors. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at a discount through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible
	compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The initial offering period under the ESPP began on December&nbsp;19, 2014 and ended on November&nbsp;16, 2015, on which date participating employees purchased shares at $20.40 per share, which is 85%
	of the price to the public of a share of the Company&#146;s common stock in its IPO. Following the initial offering period, the ESPP provides for consecutive six-month offering periods beginning on the first trading day on or after November&nbsp;15
	and May&nbsp;15 of each year, and at the end of each offering period, employees are able to purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the
	last day of the offering period.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The ESPP also provides for an

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carryforwards of
	approximately $167.3 million and $51.1 million, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income. Of these NOL carryforwards, a $3.5 million benefit will be recorded to equity when utilized. The Company also had U.S. federal and
	state tax credits of $14.6 million and $1.8 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which may be used to offset future tax liabilities. The NOL and tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033. The NOL and tax credit
	carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the
	Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (&#147;IRC&#148;). This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future
	years. The Company also has German NOL carryforwards of $4.9 million, which have an indefinite carryforward period.

	The valuation allowance relates primarily to net U.S. deferred tax assets from operating losses, research and development tax
	credit carryforwards, amounts paid and accrued to enter into various agreements for which the tax treatment requires capitalization and amortization, and success-based payments that are accrued but not yet paid for tax purposes. The Company&#146;s
	deferred tax liability relates primarily to technology acquired in the acquisition of Stage.

	The Company will continue to maintain a full valuation
	allowance on its net U.S. deferred tax assets. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required considers both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets are
	recoverable. In making this assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. In its evaluation, the Company considered its cumulative loss in recent years and its forecasted losses in the near-term as significant
	negative evidence. Based upon a review of the four sources of income identified within ASC 740, the Company determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a full valuation allowance on its U.S. net deferred tax assets
	will be maintained. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets going forward and will adjust the valuation allowance as needed. Increases in the valuation allowance were $89.2 million and $78.8 million for the
	years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that it will realize the benefit of the losses for its Germany subsidiary and has not recorded a valuation allowance against the
	German deferred tax assets.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740,
<I>
	Accounting for Income Taxes
</I>
	, and the accounting guidance related to
	accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company determines its uncertain tax positions based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be
	sustained upon examination by the relevant income tax authorities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has no uncertain tax positions. The Company has not, as yet, conducted a study of tax credit carryforwards. Such a study, if
	undertaken by the Company, would not result in a material adjustment to the Company&#146;s tax credit carryforwards. The Company will recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized benefits in income tax expense. The Company
	is generally subject to examination by the U.S. federal and local income tax authorities for all tax years in which a loss carryforward is available and is subject to examination in Germany for four years.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited Juno Therapeutics, Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria established in
	Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Juno Therapeutics, Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective
	internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
	responsibility is to express an opinion on the company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audit in
	accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
	reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
	effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
	reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
	(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
	necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
	of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
	effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As indicated in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management&#146;s assessment of and conclusion
	on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Stage Cell Therapeutics GmbH, which is included in the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Juno Therapeutics, Inc. and constituted
	$37.2&nbsp;million and $2.7&nbsp;million of total and net assets, respectively, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and $0.6&nbsp;million and $3.9&nbsp;million of revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control
	over financial reporting of Juno Therapeutics, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Stage Cell Therapeutics GmbH.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, Juno Therapeutics, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31,

	Calculation of Success Payments
</U>
	. If, pursuant to and as permitted by Section&nbsp;3(a) of the Original Letter Agreement, the Company
	elects in its sole discretion to satisfy an obligation to make a Success Payment on a Success Payment Date, including on the IPO Success Payment Date or any Success Payment Date arising from a Subsequent IPO-Related Valuation Date (a
	&#147;
<B>
<I>
	Subsequent IPO-Related Success Payment Date

<I>

</I>
	(B)&nbsp;any indirect cost offsets (&#147;
<B>
<I>
	Indirect Costs
</I>
</B>
	&#148;) attributable to MSKCC pursuant to the side letter, dated October&nbsp;2, 2015, between for MSKCC
	and the Company, attached hereto as
<U>
	Exhibit A
</U>
	(the &#147;

	by
</I>
	(ii)&nbsp;the volume weighted average trading price of a share of the common stock of the Company on the Principal Market
	for the last trading day preceding the applicable Success Payment Date as reported by Bloomberg. To the extent that the amount deducted by the Company as Indirect Costs pursuant to clause (i)(B) above is disputed, the parties shall cooperate in good
	faith to resolve such dispute;
<I>
	provided
</I>
	,
<I>
	however
</I>
	, that the Company shall in any event be entitled to deduct any amount it believes in good faith to constitute Indirect Costs from the applicable Success Payment;
<I>
	provided
</I>
	,
<I>
	further
</I>
	, that to the extent that it is determined following the Success Payment Date that the amount deducted as Indirect Costs pursuant to clause (i)(B) from the applicable Success Payment was in excess of actual Indirect Costs as of the
	Success Payment Date, the amount of such excess shall be paid by the Company to MSKCC in cash (even if the Company had elected to make the associated Success Payment in stock). By way of example, if a Success Payment of $10 million becomes required
	as of the IPO Success Payment Date, the number of shares to be issued to MSKCC (if Juno elects to satisfy its payment obligation by issuance of common stock by the Company) would be determined by dividing $10 million (less any deduction for Indirect
	Costs pursuant to clause (i)(B) above) by the volume weighted average trading price of a share of such common stock on the Principal Market for the last trading day preceding the IPO Success Payment Date (which, based on an IPO Success Payment Date
	of March&nbsp;18, 2016, is expected to be March&nbsp;17, 2016) as reported by Bloomberg. The parties agree that, solely for purpose of calculating the number of shares deliverable by the Company on the IPO Success Payment Date, the Indirect Costs
	will not be deemed to exceed $1.1 million. Any refund required to be made by Juno to MSKCC under the Indirect Costs Letter for an [***] Offset Amount (as defined in the Indirect Costs Letter) shall be paid in cash even if Juno had elected to make
	the associated Success Payment in stock.

	a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting his or her local human resources representative. Participant authorizes the Company, any stock plan service provider selected by the Company and any other
	possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of
	implementing, administering and managing his or her participation in the Plan. Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage Participant&#146;s participation in the Plan. Participant
	understands if he or she resides outside the United States, he or she may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents
	herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing his or her local human resources representative. Further, Participant understands that he or she is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If Participant does not
	consent, or if Participant later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her status as a Service Provider and career with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing Participant&#146;s
	consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Participant Restricted Stock Units or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, Participant understands that refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect
	Participant&#146;s ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of Participant&#146;s refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, Participant understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources
	representative.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As an Eligible Employee under the Plan, you have certain rights and protections under ERISA:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	(a) You may examine (without charge) all Plan documents, including any amendments and copies of all documents filed with the U.S. Department
	of Labor. These documents are available for your review in the Company&#146;s Human Resources Department.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	(b) You may obtain copies of
	all Plan documents and other Plan information upon written request to the Administrator. A reasonable charge may be made for such copies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to creating rights for Eligible Employees, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan.
	The people who operate the Plan (called &#147;
<B>
	fiduciaries
</B>
	&#148;) have a duty to do so prudently and in the interests of you and the other Eligible Employees. No one, including the Company or any other person, may fire you or otherwise
	discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit under the Plan or exercising your rights under ERISA. If your claim for a severance benefit is denied, in whole or in part, you must receive a written explanation of the
	reason for the denial. You have the right to have the denial of your claim reviewed. (The claim review procedure is explained in Section&nbsp;16 above.)
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For example, if you request materials and do not receive them within
	thirty (30)&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Administrator to provide the materials and to pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent due to
	reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a federal court. If it should happen that you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may
	seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court.

	In any case, the court will decide who will pay court costs and legal fees. If you are
	successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds that your claim is frivolous.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If you have any questions regarding the Plan, please contact the Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your
	rights under ERISA, you may contact the nearest area office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (formerly the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration), U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory, or the Division of
	Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20210. You also may obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under

	,
	that you have been selected to participate in the Company&#146;s Change in Control and Severance Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). A copy of the Plan was delivered to you with this Participation Agreement. Your participation in the Plan is subject to all
	of the terms and conditions of the Plan.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to actually become a participant in the Plan (an &#147;Eligible Employee&#148; as described in the
	Plan), you must complete and sign this Participation Agreement and return it to [NAME] no later than [DATE].
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Plan describes in detail certain
	circumstances under which you may become eligible for Severance Benefits. As described more fully in the Plan, you may become eligible for certain Severance Benefits under Section&nbsp;5.1 of the Plan if, during the Change in Control Period, you
	voluntarily terminate your employment with the Company (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) for Good Reason or the Company (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) terminates your employment for a reason other than Cause and other than
	as a result of your Disability or death. In addition (but in lieu of the Severance Benefits described in the preceding sentence), as described more fully in the Plan, you may become eligible for certain Severance Benefits under Section&nbsp;5.2 of
	the Plan if the Company (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) terminates your employment for a reason other than Cause and other than as a result of your Disability or death, and such termination occurs other than during the Change in Control
	Period.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to receive any Severance Benefits for which you otherwise become eligible under the Plan, you must sign and deliver to the Company the
	Release, which must have become effective and irrevocable within the requisite period, and adhere to the non-disparagement, non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of the Plan throughout the Severance Term. Also, as explained in the Plan,
	your Severance Benefits (if any) will be reduced if necessary to avoid your Severance Benefits from becoming subject to &#147;golden parachute&#148; excise taxes under the Internal Revenue Code.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	By your signature below, you and the Company agree that your participation in the Plan is governed by this Participation Agreement and the provisions of the
	Plan. Your signature below confirms that: (1)&nbsp;you have received a copy of the Change in Control and Severance Plan and Summary Plan Description; (2)&nbsp;you have carefully read this Participation Agreement and the Change in Control and
	Severance Plan and Summary Plan Description; and (3)&nbsp;decisions and determinations by the Administrator under the Plan will be final and binding on you and your successors.
