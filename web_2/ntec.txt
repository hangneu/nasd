	This Annual Report

	product development efforts, business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies, plans and prospects. In addition,
	from time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. Forward-looking
	statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo;
	&ldquo;plan,&rdquo; &ldquo;may,&rdquo; &ldquo;should,&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipate,&rdquo; &ldquo;could,&rdquo; &ldquo;might,&rdquo;

	to historical matters. These forward-looking statements may be included in, among other things, various filings made by us with
	the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our
	authorized executive officers. Forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results
	as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements
	are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results
	expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially
	from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the factors summarized

	For the years ended
	December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, we had net losses of NIS 18.4 million, NIS 20.4 million and NIS 27.9 million, respectively,
	and we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, we will ultimately need to generate significant
	revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability
	in the future. If our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory clearance or approval, or if our product
	candidates do not achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability,
	or substantial delays in achieving profitability, could negatively impact the value of our ordinary shares and our ability to raise
	additional financing. A substantial decline in the value of our ordinary shares would also affect the price at which we could sell
	shares to secure future funding, which could dilute the ownership interest of current shareholders.

	Even if we achieve
	profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Accordingly, it is difficult to
	evaluate our business prospects. Moreover, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered
	by an early-stage company in highly regulated and competitive markets, such as the biopharmaceutical market, where regulatory approval
	and market acceptance of our products are uncertain. There can be no assurance that our efforts will ultimately be successful or
	result in revenues or profits.

	In past years, the

	crisis as well as a variety of other factors including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished
	liquidity and credit availability, ratings downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. The U.S. and certain

	conditions by providing liquidity and stability to the financial markets. If the actions taken by these governments are not successful,

	current volatile and unpredictable global economic situation, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party

	We license our core
	intellectual property from Yissum, an affiliate of Hebrew University. We initially entered into an exclusive license agreement
	with Yissum in 2000 and, in 2004 and 2005, we amended the license, which we refer to, as amended, as the License Agreement. According
	to the License Agreement, we hold an exclusive license for developing, manufacturing and/or world marketing of products that are
	directly or indirectly based on the patent owned by Yissum and/or other related intellectual property (including any information,
	research results and related know-how). Yissum is not permitted to transfer such intellectual property to third parties without
	our prior written consent. Yissum may obtain future financing from other entities for its research, provided that such entities
	will not be granted rights in its results (including other IP rights) in a way prejudicing the rights granted to us in accordance
	with the License Agreement. We are entitled to grant perpetual sublicenses of this intellectual property to third parties, and
	such third parties will not be required to assume any undertaking towards Yissum. We are obligated to research and develop products
	that are based on the IP and to pay Yissum from the date of first sale an amount equal to 3% of our net sales of products based
	on the intellectual property and 15% from all other payments or benefits received from any such sublicense. In addition, also in
	consideration of the exclusive license granted to us pursuant to the License Agreement, we issued 5,618 ordinary shares to Yissum.
	As of the date of this annual report, no payments were paid and/or are due under the License Agreement. The License Agreement will
	be in effect until the latest of: (1) the expiration of the last registered patent within the relevant territory in November 2020;
	and (2) 15 years from the date of the first commercial sale. We also contracted with Yissum for laboratory services. In January
	2008, we signed an addendum to the License Agreement to conduct an additional joint development and study regarding a technology,
	different from the Accordion Pill, for the GR of a drug. This addendum provides that the intellectual property rights produced
	as a result of the joint development and study will be jointly owned and we are entitled to receive a license for Yissum&rsquo;s
	share in these rights in return for payment of royalties. One patent application has been filed by Yissum and us as a result of
	the development related to that joint project, but this patent application was abandoned.

	The License Agreement
	imposes certain payment, reporting, confidentiality and other obligations on us. In the event that we were to breach any of our
	obligations under the License Agreement and fail to cure such breach, Yissum would have the right to terminate the License Agreement
	upon 30 days&rsquo; notice. In addition, Yissum has the right to terminate the License Agreement upon our bankruptcy or receivership.
	If any dispute arises with respect to our arrangement with Yissum, such dispute may disrupt our operations and would likely have
	a material and adverse impact on us if resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to us. Most of our current product candidates are
	partly based on the intellectual property licensed under the License Agreement, and if the License Agreement was terminated, it
	would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.

	A significant portion
	of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us. Under the Israeli Patent
	Law, 5727-1967, or the Patent Law, inventions conceived by an employee in the course and as a result of or arising from his or
	her employment with a company are regarded as &ldquo;service inventions,&rdquo; which belong to the employer, absent a specific
	agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights. The Patent Law also provides that if
	there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee, the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, or the Committee,
	a body constituted under the Patent Law, shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his inventions. Recent
	decisions by the Committee (which have been upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court on appeal) have created uncertainty in this area,
	as it held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having specifically waived any such
	rights. However, a recent decision by the Committee held that such right can be waived by the employee. The Committee further held
	that an explicit reference to the waived right is not necessary in every circumstance in order for the employee&rsquo;s waiver
	of such right to be valid. Such waiver can be formalized in writing or orally or be implied by the actions of the parties in accordance
	with the rules of interpretation of Israeli contract law. We generally enter into assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees
	pursuant to which such individuals assign to us all rights to any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement
	with us. Although our employees have agreed to assign to us service invention rights, we may face claims demanding remuneration
	in consideration for assigned inventions.

	We entered into a
	feasibility and option agreement with a pharmaceutical company and engaged in a feasibility study over a period of several months
	during the early stage of formulation of the Accordion Pill for Carbidopa/Levodopa. The agreement included a right of first offer,
	under certain circumstances. In 2012, the pharmaceutical company asserted that it has a right of first refusal in the event that
	we seek to grant a license to certain intellectual property contained in AP-CDLD to any third party. We believe that the pharmaceutical
	company does not have such right and that the right of first offer included in the agreement terminated in 2008. In addition, we
	believe that such right of first offer only applied to licenses for use in the United States. If we seek to grant a license to
	certain intellectual property contained in AP-CDLD to any third party, we can, in our discretion, either first offer the main terms
	of such license to the other pharmaceutical company pursuant to the alleged right of first offer, which we believe terminated in
	2008, or seek to grant such license to a third party without first offering the main terms of such license to the other pharmaceutical
	company, in which case the other pharmaceutical company may seek to challenge such third-party license or claim damages. Although
	we would intend to vigorously defend against any such challenge or claim, there can be no guarantee that we would be successful
	in such defense. Any such challenge or claim for damages made by the other pharmaceutical company, if we choose not to make a first
	offer, could adversely affect our ability to develop, or the timing of our development of, AP-CDLD. Further, the allegation that
	any such right exists, even though we believe that any such right has terminated, could discourage other potential licensees from
	working with us. Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.

	Our product candidates
	must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy for a specific indication before they can be approved for commercial use
	by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have full discretion over this approval
	process. We will need to conduct significant additional research, including testing in animals and in humans, before we can file
	applications for product approval. Typically, in the pharmaceutical industry, there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates
	in preclinical testing and clinical trials. Also, even though we believe that some of our product candidates may be eligible for
	FDA review under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the FDA may not agree with that assessment,
	and may require us to submit the application under Section 505(b)(1) which usually requires more comprehensive clinical data than
	applications submitted under Section 505(b)(2). Even under Section 505(b)(2), satisfying FDA&rsquo;s requirements typically takes
	many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
	Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. For example,
	a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in
	advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered
	based upon additional government regulation, including any changes in legislation or FDA policy, during the process of product
	development, clinical trials and regulatory reviews. After clinical trials are completed, the FDA has substantial discretion in
	the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing
	studies.

	of a specific condition in a specific way subject to contradictions and other limitations). We anticipate that some foreign regulatory
	agencies will have different testing and approval requirements from those of the FDA. Even if we comply with all FDA requests,
	the FDA may ultimately reject or decline to approve one or more of our new drug applications, or it may grant approval for a narrowly
	intended use that is not commercially feasible. We might not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely

	patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDA for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation.
	Further, it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay
	approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly
	delay, or even prevent, the approval of a new product. Even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially

	products candidates, even following regulatory approval. A product approval, even if issued, may limit the uses for which such
	product may be distributed, which could adversely affect the commercial viability of the product. Moreover, third parties may develop
	superior products or have proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing our products. We also expect that our product candidates,
	if approved, will generally be more expensive than the non-Accordion Pill version of the same medication available to patients.
	Physician and patient acceptance of, and demand for, any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval or license
	will depend largely on many factors, including, but not limited to, the extent, if any, of reimbursement of costs by government
	agencies and other third-party payors, pricing, competition, the effectiveness of our marketing and distribution efforts, the safety
	and effectiveness of alternative products, and the prevalence and severity of side effects associated with such products. If physicians,

	after approval that were not seen or anticipated during pre-approval clinical trials or other studies. Any adverse effects observed

	Specifically, in both
	the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the
	healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription
	Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare
	covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and certain
	others. Prior to MMA, Medicare did not cover most outpatient prescription drugs. MMA created a new voluntary Part D, which covers
	outpatient drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and is administered by private insurance plans that operate partially at-risk under
	contract with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS. These private Part D plans have incentives to keep costs
	down. MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition,
	this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of certain outpatient drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic
	class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional
	pressure to contain and reduce costs. These and future cost-reduction initiatives could decrease the coverage and price that we
	receive for our products, if approved, and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare
	beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement
	rates, and any reduction in reimbursement under Medicare may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

	In March 2010, the
	Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, or the Affordable Care Act, which was amended by the Health Care and Education
	Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, PPACA, became law in the United States. The goal of PPACA is to reduce the cost
	of healthcare and substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other measures,
	PPACA imposes increased rebates on manufacturers for certain covered drug products reimbursed by state Medicaid programs. While
	we cannot predict the full effect PPACA will have on federal reimbursement policies in general or on our business specifically,
	the PPACA may result in downward pressure on drug reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of our products.
	In addition, we cannot predict whether new proposals will be made or adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may
	have on us if they are adopted.

	Delays in regulatory
	approval, limitations in regulatory approval and withdrawals of regulatory approval may have a material adverse effect on us. If
	we experience significant delays in testing or receiving approvals or sign-offs to conduct clinical trials, our product development
	costs, or our ability to license product candidates, will increase. If the FDA or other foreign regulatory entities grant regulatory
	approval to market a product, this approval will be limited to those diseases and conditions for which the product has demonstrated,
	through clinical trials, to be safe and effective. Any product approvals that we receive in the future could also include significant
	restrictions on the use or marketing of our products. Product approvals, if granted, can be withdrawn for failure to comply with
	regulatory requirements or upon the occurrence of adverse events following commercial introduction of the products. Failure to
	comply with applicable FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall
	or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or injunction, as well as other regulatory action against our
	product candidates or us. If approval is withdrawn for a product, or if a product were seized or recalled, we would be unable to
	sell or license that product and our revenues would suffer. In addition, outside the United States, our ability to market any of
	our potential products is contingent upon receiving market application authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities.
	These foreign regulatory approval processes may include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above,

	Increasing expenditures
	for healthcare have been the subject of considerable public attention in the United States. Both private and government entities
	are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs. Numerous proposals that would effect changes in the U.S. healthcare system
	have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures, including reducing reimbursement for prescription
	products and reducing the levels at which consumers and healthcare providers are reimbursed for purchases of pharmaceutical products.

	In the United States,
	the Medicare Modernization Act changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare
	coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered
	drugs. In recent years, Congress has considered further reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs administered by physicians.
	CMS has issued and will continue to issue regulations to implement the law which will affect Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party
	payors. Medicare, which is the single largest third-party payment program and which is administered by CMS, covers prescription
	drugs in one of two ways. Medicare part B covers outpatient prescription drugs that are administered by physicians and Medicare
	part D covers other outpatient prescription drugs, but through private insurers. Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor,
	is funded jointly by CMS and the states, but is administered by the states; states are authorized to cover outpatient prescription
	drugs, but that coverage is subject to caps and to substantial rebates. CMS also has the authority to revise reimbursement rates
	and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation
	or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we
	can receive for those products. While the Medicare Modernization Act and implementing regulations apply primarily to drug benefits
	for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement
	rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction
	in payments from private payors.

	In March 2010, President
	Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain
	the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and
	health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional
	health policy reforms. As amended, the PPACA expanded manufacturers&rsquo; rebate liability to include covered drugs dispensed
	to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, increased the minimum rebate due for innovator drugs (both
	single source drugs and innovator multiple source drugs) from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP or the
	difference between the AMP and best price, whichever is greater. The total rebate amount for innovator drugs is capped at 100.0%
	of AMP. The PPACA and subsequent legislation also narrowed the definition of AMP. Furthermore, the PPACA imposes a significant
	annual, nondeductible fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions
	affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and a significant
	number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. Although it is too early to determine the effect of
	the PPACA, it appears likely to continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and
	may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.

	In
	addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. More recently, in August 2011,
	the President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee
	on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted
	deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&rsquo;s automatic
	reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up
	to 2.0% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of
	2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and
</FONT>
	increased the
	statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Bipartisan
	Budget Act of 2015, signed into law on November 2, 2015, increased the rebates that generic drug manufacturers are obligated to
	pay under the Medicaid program by applying a inflation-based rebate formula to generic that previously only applied to brand name
	drugs. If we ever obtain regulatory approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates, these new laws
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF">
	may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our
	customers and accordingly, our financial operations. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval
	requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative
	changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such
	changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates may be.

	Although we cannot
	predict the full effect on our business of the implementation of existing legislation, including the PPACA or the enactment of
	additional legislation pursuant to healthcare and other legislative reform, we believe that legislation or regulations that would
	reduce reimbursement for or restrict coverage of our products could adversely affect how much or under what circumstances healthcare
	providers will prescribe or administer our products. This could materially and adversely affect our business by reducing our ability
	to generate revenue, raise capital, obtain additional collaborators and market our products. In addition, we believe the increasing
	emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of pharmaceutical products,
	which may adversely impact product sales.

	As federal and state budget pressures continue, federal and state administrative agencies may also continue to escalate investigation
	and enforcement efforts to reduce or eliminate waste and to control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs. Private
	enforcement of healthcare fraud has also increased, due in large part to amendments to the False Claims Act that were designed

	Since February 2011,
	Egypt has experienced political turbulence and an increase in terrorist activity in the Sinai Peninsula following the resignation
	of Hosni Mubarak as president. This included protests throughout Egypt, and the appointment of a military regime in his stead,
	followed by the elections to parliament which brought groups affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood (which had been previously
	outlawed by Egypt), and the subsequent overthrow of this elected government by a military regime instead. Such political turbulence
	and violence may damage peaceful and diplomatic relations between Israel and Egypt, and could affect the region as a whole. Similar
	civil unrest and political turbulence has occurred in other countries in the region, including Syria which shares a common border
	with Israel, and is affecting the political stability of those countries. Since April 2011, internal conflict in Syria has escalated,
	and evidence indicates that chemical weapons have been used in the region. Intervention may be contemplated by outside parties

	and economic relationships that exist between the State of Israel and some of these countries, and may have the potential for additional
	conflicts in the region. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and may be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also
	believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and various
	rebel militia groups in Syria. These situations may potentially escalate in the future to more violent events which may affect

	of 40 (or older, for reservists who are military officers or who have certain occupations) and, in the event of a military conflict,
	may be called to active duty. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of
	military reservists. It is possible that there will be military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted
	by such call-ups, which may include the call-up of members of our management. Such disruption could materially adversely affect

	Under the Research
	Law, research and development programs which meet specified criteria and are approved by a committee of the OCS are eligible for
	grants. The grants awarded are typically up to 50% of the project&rsquo;s expenditures, as determined by the research committee.
	The grantee is required to pay royalties to the OCS on income generated from the sale of products (and related services associated
	with such products), whether received by the grantee or any affiliated entity, as defined in the Encouragement of Industrial Research
	and Development Regulations (Royalty Rates and Rules for Payment), 5756-1996, or the Royalty Regulations, developed, in whole or
	in part, within the framework of an OCS-funded project or deriving therefrom. In accordance with the provisions of the Royalty
	Regulations, royalties are paid beginning from the date of the sale of the first product developed according to an OCS-funded project
	at rates between 3% to 6% (though typically not greater than 4.5%) of sales of the product, depending on the situation and applicable
	criteria, and are payable until the repayment of the full amount of the total OCS funding linked to the U.S. Dollar and accrued
	interest (LIBOR), or in certain cases, payable up to the increased royalty cap. The terms of the OCS participation also require
	that products developed using government grants be manufactured in Israel and that the technology developed thereunder may not
	be transferred outside of Israel, unless approval is received from the OCS (such approval is not required for the transfer of a
	portion of the manufacturing capacity which does not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the portion declared to be manufactured abroad
	in the applications for funding, in which case only notification is required) and additional payments are made to the OCS. However,
	this does not restrict the export of products that incorporate the funded technology. Following the full payment of such royalties
	and interest, there is generally no further liability for payment. Nonetheless, the restrictions under the Research Law (as generally
	specified herein) will continue to apply even after we have repaid the full amount of royalty payable pursuant to the grants.

	volume that is performed outside Israel. A company also has the option of declaring in its OCS grant application its intention
	to exercise a portion of the manufacturing capacity abroad, thus avoiding the need to obtain additional approval after approval

	If we wish to transfer

	(i.e., asset sale of OCS-funded know-how or transfer as part of certain merger and acquisition transactions), the company continues
	to conduct its research activity in Israel (for at least three years following such transfer and keeps on staff at least 75% of
	the number of research employees it had for the six months before the know-how was transferred), then the company is eligible for

	Further, the stock
	market in general, the NASDAQ Capital Market and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
	price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of small companies
	like ours. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our ordinary shares regardless of our actual
	operating performance. In addition, a systemic decline in the financial markets and related factors beyond our control may cause
	our share price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly. Price volatility of our ordinary shares might be worse if the trading volume
	of our ordinary shares is low. In the past, following periods of market volatility, shareholders have often instituted securities
	class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and
	attention of management from our business, even if we are successful. Future sales of our ordinary shares could also reduce the
	market price of such shares.

	Moreover, the liquidity
	of our ordinary shares will be limited, not only in terms of the number of ordinary shares that can be bought and sold at a given
	price, but by potential delays in the timing of executing transactions in our ordinary shares and a reduction in security analyst
	and media&rsquo;s coverage of our Company, if any. These factors may result in lower prices for our ordinary shares than might
	otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and ask prices for our ordinary shares. In addition,
	without a large float, our ordinary shares will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as
	a result, the trading prices of our ordinary shares may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an
	investor may be unable to liquidate its investment in our ordinary shares. Trading of a relatively small volume of our ordinary
	shares may have a greater impact on the trading price of our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger. We
	cannot predict the prices at which our ordinary shares will trade in the future.

	Generally, if for
	any taxable year 75% or more of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of our assets are held for the production of,
	or produce, passive income, we would be characterized as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes. The characterization of our Company as a PFIC for 2016 has not yet been determined. Because PFIC status is determined
	annually and is based on our income, assets and activities for the entire taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will
	not be classified as a PFIC in any future year. If we were to be characterized as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
	any taxable year during which a U.S. Investor, as defined in &ldquo;Taxation &mdash; U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences&rdquo;,
	owns ordinary shares, such U.S. Investor could face adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including having gains realized
	on the sale of our ordinary shares classified as ordinary income, rather than as capital gain, the loss of the preferential rate
	applicable to dividends received on our ordinary shares by individuals who are U.S. Investors, and having interest charges apply
	to distributions by us and the proceeds of share sales. Certain elections exist that may alleviate some adverse consequences of
	PFIC status and would result in an alternative treatment (such as mark-to-market treatment) of our ordinary shares; however, we
	do not intend to provide the information necessary for U.S. Investors to make &ldquo;qualified electing fund elections&rdquo; if
	we are classified as a PFIC. See &ldquo;Taxation &mdash; U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.&rdquo;

	We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on
	developing drugs based on our proprietary Accordion Pill platform technology, which we refer to as the Accordion Pill. Our Accordion
	Pill is an oral drug delivery system that is designed to improve the efficacy and safety of existing drugs and drugs in development
	by utilizing an efficient gastric retention, or GR, and specific release mechanism. Our product pipeline currently includes three
	product candidates in clinical trial stages. Our leading product candidate, Accordion Pill Carbidopa/Levodopa, or AP-CDLD, is being
	developed for the indication of treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients.
	We have successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial for AP-CDLD for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease symptoms in
	advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients and have agreed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, on the remaining
	clinical development program for AP-CDLD for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s
	disease patients, including the main principles of the single required pivotal Phase III clinical trial in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s
	disease patients. See &ldquo;&mdash; Current Regulatory Status of AP-CDLD.&rdquo; In December 2015, we received a United States
	centralized institutional review board, or IRB, approval to initiate a Phase III clinical trial for AP-CDLD. See &ldquo;&mdash;
	Current Regulatory Status of AP-CDLD.&rdquo; Our second product candidate, Accordion Pill Zaleplon, or AP&ndash;ZP, is being developed
	for the indication of treatment of insomnia, including sleep induction and the improvement of sleep maintenance. We have successfully
	completed a Phase II clinical trial for AP&ndash;ZP for the treatment of insomnia under an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application
	that we submitted to the FDA on August 4, 2009 for AP&ndash;ZP as a treatment for the induction and maintenance of sleep in patients
	suffering from insomnia. In our correspondence with the FDA, the FDA previously agreed that an acceptable regulatory pathway for
	AP-CDLD and AP&ndash;ZP would be to file a new drug application, or NDA, pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug,
	and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, which is a streamlined approval pathway that may accelerate the time to commercialize and decrease the
	costs of AP&ndash;CDLD and AP&ndash;ZP, as compared to those typically associated with a NCE. See &ldquo;&mdash; Government Regulation
	&mdash; 505(b)(2) Applications.&rdquo; The FDA has indicated in written correspondence to us that we may be able to design the
	development program for AP-ZP in a manner that would allow us to obtain sufficient data for the NDA submission for AP-ZP in one
	pivotal Phase III clinical trial. However, at this point in the development process of AP-ZP, the details of such a trial have
	not been determined or confirmed with the FDA. In March 2016, we completed a Phase I clinical trial for our third pipeline product
	candidate which is being developed for the prevention and treatment of gastroduodenal and small bowel Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory
	Drug, or NSAID, induced ulcers. The pharmacokinetics, or PK, results demonstrated in the Phase I trial were within the well-defined
	safety levels of the drug, which enable us to proceed with further development of the Accordion Pill with the existing drug.

	Our Accordion Pill
	platform technology is designed to increase the time that drugs are retained in the stomach as compared to other oral dosage forms,
	such as tablets and capsules. This capability is particularly important to drugs with a NAW, which are absorbed mainly in the upper
	part of the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Regular controlled-release formulations of such drugs currently on the market sometimes
	fail to provide an efficient solution, as once the regular dosage form has passed the drug&rsquo;s NAW in the upper GI tract, the
	drug is not, or is very poorly, absorbed in the distal parts of the GI tract. The Accordion Pill platform technology is also designed
	for drugs with low solubility, which do not efficiently dissolve in the GI tract, and drugs with low permeability, which do not
	efficiently penetrate the intestinal wall and reach the blood stream, such as Biopharmaceutics Classification System, or BCS, Class
	II (low solubility, high permeability) and Class IV (low solubility, low permeability) drugs. According to The AAPS Journal published
	by the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, of the top 200 oral drugs in the United States, Great Britain, Spain
	and Japan in 2006, approximately 30% to 35% were BCS Class II drugs and approximately 5% to 10% were BCS Class IV drugs. Further,
	according to Drug Development &amp; Delivery, in 2006 approximately 90% of NCEs in development were either BCS Class II or Class
	IV drugs. Poorly soluble drugs are sometimes characterized by low bioavailability, which is strongly affected by the drug&rsquo;s
	solubility. In addition, the extent of absorption of poorly soluble drugs can be dose dependent, leading to non-linear PK behavior.
	The Accordion Pill&rsquo;s efficient GR and specific release mechanism prolongs the absorption phase of drugs with an NAW, which
	can result in significantly more stable plasma levels. In addition, the Accordion Pill has demonstrated an enhancement of the absorption
	of a poorly soluble, BCS Class II/IV drug in a crossover PK clinical study in 12 healthy volunteers. For poorly soluble drugs,
	we believe that our technology acts through the gradual delivery of an undissolved drug by the Accordion Pill in the stomach, which
	allows for the complete dissolution of the drug dose in the stomach over the delivery period. The gradual passage of the drug from
	the stomach to the upper part of the GI tract enables an increase in the amount of the drug that can be dissolved and thus absorbed,
	in the upper small bowel. In addition, we believe that bile secretion in the upper part of the GI tract also improves the intestinal
	environment for better absorption. Finally, the significant dilution of the drug solution in the small bowel caused by prolonged
	delivery increases the amount of the drug available for absorption.

	Our clinical trials

	predetermined release profile for each specific drug associated with our Accordion Pill technology demonstrated a significant improvement
	in PK, which is the drug plasma level over time and a corresponding improvement in efficacy and safety.

	Our current product
	development pipeline includes three products in clinical trial stages. Our leading pipeline product, AP-CDLD, is focused on leveraging
	our Accordion Pill technology to improve the efficacy and safety of an approved drug for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease
	symptoms in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients. We have agreed with the FDA on the remaining clinical development program
	for AP-CDLD for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients, including the
	main principles of the single required pivotal Phase III clinical trial in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients. In December
	2015, we received a United States centralized institutional review board, or IRB, approval to initiate a Phase III clinical trial
	for AP-CDLD. Our second product, AP&ndash;ZP, is for the treatment of insomnia. We are currently seeking a potential strategic
	partner for further clinical development and commercialization of AP&ndash;ZP and our future development plans for AP&ndash;ZP
	will depend on the results of this process. We have an exclusive license from Yissum, an affiliate of The Hebrew University of
	Jerusalem, for developing, manufacturing and global marketing of products based on the core technology used in the Accordion Pill.
	In March 2016, we completed a Phase I clinical trial for our third pipeline product candidate which is being developed for the
	prevention and treatment of gastroduodenal and small bowel NSAID induced ulcers. The PK results demonstrated in the Phase I trial
	were within the well-defined safety levels of the drug, which enable us to proceed with further development of the Accordion Pill
	with the existing drug.

	On April 15, 2015,
	we entered into an agreement with Biogen MA Inc., which we refer to as Biogen, for the development of a designated Accordion Pill

	of the option, Biogen will be responsible for, and bear all costs associated with, pre-clinical and clinical activities required
	for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approval for the product being developed, as well as for the manufacturing and commercialization
	thereof. Biogen has also agreed to consider in good faith engaging us as a manufacturer of commercial supply of the product being

	No high fat or high calorie diet requirements when using our Accordion Pill products
</I>
</B>
	.&emsp;In
	our clinical trials, our Accordion Pill products provided modified PK to achieve desired clinical efficacy and safety of the drugs
	with which it was combined through prolonged GR under a regular calorie diet and did not require administration with a high calorie
	and high fat meal, which is a prerequisite for the administration of approved GR products currently on the market. This is highly
	important in the treatment of various diseases. In a food effect study that we conducted of our Phase III formulation of AP-CDLD,
	our results demonstrated that plasma concentrations of Carbidopa and Levodopa were similar, with no statistically significant differences
	in all PK parameters measured, when AP-CDLD was taken with various food compositions. This suggests that the treatment with AP-CDLD,
	intended to be taken b.i.d (two times a day) or t.i.d (three times a day) with food, is independent of food content.

	periods of decreased motor and non-motor functions. We are pursuing the development and approval of AP-CDLD under the Section 505(b)(2)
	pathway, which allows an abbreviated path to approval relying on a single pivotal Phase III clinical trial. In December 2015 we
	received a U.S. centralized IRB approval to initiate a Phase III clinical trial of AP-CDLD. We intend to begin recruiting patients
	for the trial in the first half of 2016. If our pivotal Phase III clinical trial is successful, we intend to file for regulatory

	under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA may be permitted to reference safety and effectiveness data submitted by the original manufacturer
	of the underlying approved drug as part of its NDA, be based on the FDA&rsquo;s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness
	of that previously approved drug, or rely on in part on data in the public domain. Reliance on data collected by others may expedite
	the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to
	generate to submit an NDA. As the FDA has previously agreed that our two current pipeline products in clinical trial stages would
	likely be eligible to file under Section 505(b)(2), assuming the successful completion of the Phase III clinical trials, we believe
	that there is a strong likelihood that our future products would similarly qualify. The factors related to this qualification are
	expected to reduce the time and costs associated with clinical trials when compared to a traditional NDA for an NCE. We also believe
	the strategy of targeting drugs with proven safety and efficacy provides a better prospect of clinical success of our proprietary

	Parkinson&rsquo;s
	disease is a progressive, degenerative disease characterized by movement symptoms such as involuntary tremor or trembling in the
	hands, arms and legs; muscle rigidity of the limbs and trunk; slowness of and a decline in movement; and impaired balance and coordination.
	In its advanced stages, the disease causes comprehensive dysfunction of the patient&rsquo;s bodily systems, including difficulties
	in swallowing, speech disorders and significant mental decline. Parkinson&rsquo;s disease results from a continuing loss of dopamine-producing
	nerve cells. Dopamine is required for normal functioning of the central nervous system and smooth, coordinated function of the
	body&rsquo;s muscles and movement. According to the National Parkinson&rsquo;s Foundation, the symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease
	appear when approximately 60&ndash;80% of dopamine-producing cells are damaged.

	Although there is
	presently no cure for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, there are a number of medications that provide relief from the symptoms. Dopamine
	replacement therapy with Levodopa is generally considered to be the most effective treatment for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. After
	50 years of clinical use, Levodopa therapy still offers the best symptomatic control of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and is the most
	widely used therapy. Levodopa is converted into dopamine in the brain and is usually administered with Carbidopa, which helps prevent
	Levodopa from converting to dopamine outside the brain. Levodopa helps reduce tremor, stiffness and slowness and helps improve
	muscle control, balance and walking. Virtually all Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients will require Levodopa therapy during the
	course of their disease.

	Parkinson&rsquo;s

	disease, there is a decline in the capacity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, or the brain pathways that moderate control
	of voluntary movement, to synthesize, store, and release dopamine. Therefore, the dopaminergic system becomes more and more dependent
	on dopamine from external sources, such as Levodopa treatment.

	Recent studies have
	reported that up to 50% of patients show the onset of motor fluctuations within two years of starting conventional Levodopa therapy.
	For many patients with advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, the repeated emergence of off states can occupy up to one-third or more
	of a typical waking day. The loss of consistent symptomatic control from Levodopa is a major challenge for the long-term management
	of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. When Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients experience &ldquo;wearing off&rdquo; between Levodopa doses,
	this short-duration response occurs in parallel to the drug&rsquo;s peripheral PK profile. Therefore, with the evolution of these
	short-duration responses, improving the consistency in Levodopa&rsquo;s plasma levels becomes the major factor for improving symptom

	Oral Levodopa formulations
	currently on the market do not provide satisfactory consistent Levodopa plasma levels. There are two major challenges to maintaining
	consistency in Levodopa plasma levels: (i) the very short half-life of Levodopa (approximately 90 minutes) and (ii) the fact that
	Levodopa&rsquo;s absorption is confined to the upper part of the GI tract (i.e., it has an NAW). For drugs with an NAW, conventional
	controlled release formulations are limited in providing long-acting performance, as once the drug has passed through the upper
	GI tract, it will no longer be absorbed. These factors result in high peak-to-trough ratios of Levodopa in the plasma, namely high
	variability of the concentration of the drug in the blood, rather than a consistent level being maintained, reducing the clinical
	benefits of Levodopa therapy. Providing stable Levodopa plasma levels is therefore a major unmet need for the long-term management
	of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.

	AP-CDLD is designed
	to provide a combination of immediate release and a continuous release of Levodopa, in the stomach, in proximity to its absorption
	site through our Accordion Pill. AP-CDLD is designed to provide stable Levodopa plasma therapeutic levels, resulting in reduced
	total off time while reducing or avoiding inducement of troublesome dyskinesia, or involuntary movements. The stable therapeutic
	levels of Levodopa in a patient&rsquo;s plasma provided by AP-CDLD are intended to significantly reduce the motor complications
	because the motor complications which are associated with Levodopa treatment are strongly correlated with the drug&rsquo;s peripheral
	PK profile. More specifically, AP-CDLD is intended to reduce total off time while not increasing, or even reducing, troublesome
	dyskinesia.

	Our Phase II clinical
	trial with AP-CDLD was a multi-center, open-label, randomized, crossover, active control trial that included five groups. Overall,
	60 patients completed the trial per protocol, in several medical centers in Israel. The Phase II clinical trial assessed safety,
	PK and pharmacodynamics/efficacy in patients with various stages of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease compared with their current Levodopa
	treatment. Each group of the clinical trial was deemed to initiate upon the first patient enrolling in a group and to be completed
	upon the conclusion of data analysis. The initiation and completion dates for groups 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were August 2009 &ndash;
	December 2009, April 2010 &ndash; August 2010, December 2010 &ndash; July 2011, August 2011 &ndash; November 2011 and December

	Group 1 of our Phase
	II clinical trial with AP-CDLD was conducted with 12 male and female patients with non-fluctuating Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. The
	crossover design included the following treatment arms: (i) AP-CDLD 50/250 mg administered b.i.d and (ii) immediate release CDLD
	25/250 mg administered by half tablet q.i.d, resulting in a total daily dosage of 50/500mg. The treatments were administered for
	six days, with the seventh day consisting of PK testing. On the PK day of the control period, patients were given an additional
	50 mg of Carbidopa (12.5 mg q.i.d) to achieve the recommended daily 70 &ndash; 100 mg dose of Carbidopa. Immediately following
	the PK testing on day seven, the patients crossed over to the other treatment to repeat the seven day process. This study concluded
	that (i) the bioavailability of Levodopa when administered via AP-CDLD was similar to the immediate release reference; (ii) AP-CDLD
	provided more stable plasma levels of Levodopa, with reduced peak-to-trough ratio, when compared to the immediate release reference;
	and (iii) AP-CDLD provided higher morning Levodopa plasma levels than the immediate release reference.

	Group 3 of our Phase
	II clinical trial with AP-CDLD was conducted with ten male and female patients with advanced, fluctuating Parkinson&rsquo;s disease,
	of which eight completed the PK trial per protocol. The crossover design included the following treatment arms: in the AP-CDLD
	treatment arm, the AP-CDLD 50/375 mg was administered b.i.d for six at home days of treatment with up to an additional three add-on
	immediate release Carbidopa/Levodopa, as needed, and on day seven, b.i.d administration of AP-CDLD 50/375 mg. In the control arm,
	the patient&rsquo;s current treatments were administered for six at home days and, on the seventh day, they were given immediate
	release Carbidopa/Levodopa 18.75/187.5 mg q.i.d, resulting in a total dosage of 75/750 mg. On the seventh day of each treatment

	Groups 3, 4 and 6
	of our Phase II clinical trial examined the pharmacodynamic effects of AP-CDLD. Each group assessed the effects in patients with
	advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease; ten, 16 and 18 patients completed the trials per protocol in Groups 3, 4 and 6, respectively.
	Groups 3 and 4 tested AP-CDLD in the 50/375 mg strength, administered b.i.d. with additional CDLD immediate release tablets if
	needed; Group 6 tested the 50/500 mg strength administered b.i.d. with additional CDLD immediate release tablets if needed. In
	these three trials, AP-CDLD was compared to the patients&rsquo; current Levodopa treatment (including a dopamine decarboxylase
	inhibitor, such as Carbidopa). All three groups were cross-over, with Group 3 receiving the treatments as described above and Groups
	4 and 6 receiving each of their current treatment and AP-CDLD for 21 days, with the second tested treatment starting immediately
	after completion of the first. In Groups 4 and 6, off time, on time and dyskinesia were assessed by patient-completed home diaries
	during days 18 through 20 of each arm.

	Because Levodopa is
	usually prescribed for long-term treatment, three weeks of treatment with AP-CDLD was sufficient to demonstrate statistically significant
	improvements in the primary endpoint, as well as most of the secondary endpoints. The statistical significance of a result was
	captured by the associated &ldquo;p-value&rdquo;, or the estimated probability that the observed effect was by chance. A &ldquo;p-value&rdquo;
	of less than 0.05 implied that there was less than a 5% probability that the observed effect was by chance, and was generally accepted
	as a statistically significant event. These studies demonstrated that (i) total off time was decreased when taking AP-CDLD versus
	the control, by 44% and 45% in Groups 4 and 6, respectively (statistically significant p&lt;0.0001); (ii) improvements in off time
	and on time without troublesome dyskinesia did not come at the expense of an increase of on time with troublesome dyskinesia, and,
	moreover, with the AP-CDLD 50/500 mg troublesome dyskinesia was decreased by 0.5 hours (statistically significant p = 0.002); (iii)
	the effect of AP-CDLD on total off time and on time with troublesome dyskinesia resulted in a total increase of &ldquo;good&rdquo;
	on time (i.e., without troublesome dyskinesia) of 2.1 and 2.7 hours per day in Groups 4 and 6, respectively (statistically significant
	p&lt;0.0001); (iv) the improvements in treating symptoms with AP-CDLD were achieved with fewer daily doses; and (v) the improvements
	in treating symptoms with AP-CDLD correlate with stable Levodopa plasma levels throughout the day with appropriate therapeutic
	levels of the drug.

	Insomnia is a condition
	characterized by difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep during the night. Chronic insomnia, or insomnia lasting more than
	four weeks, is often associated with a wide range of adverse conditions, including mood disturbances, difficulties with concentration
	and memory, and certain cardiovascular, pulmonary and GI disorders. Chronic sleep deprivation has also been associated with an
	increased risk of depression, diabetes and obesity, among other disorders. Historically, insomnia therapies have addressed sleep
	onset rather than sleep maintenance. Newer therapies have been approved with indications for sleep maintenance, although the ability
	of currently-available drugs to maintain sleep throughout the night without unwanted next-day residual effects remains limited.

	Zaleplon, branded
	as Sonata, is a sedative (also called a hypnotic) approved for the treatment of insomnia. Zaleplon belongs to the nonbenzodiazepines
	hypnotic drug family, which is the most common type of class of drug used to treat insomnia. Zaleplon is known to induce the rapid
	and effective onset of sleep and generally does not have the next-day residual effects, that are characteristic of many other drugs
	that are currently being marketed to treat insomnia. The lack of next-day effects is largely due to Zaleplon&rsquo;s short half-life
	(approximately one hour), but, because of this short half-life, Zaleplon is cleared from the blood relatively rapidly and is generally
	not effective for maintaining sleep throughout the night. Thus, Zaleplon is currently not approved for a sleep maintenance indication
	and Zaleplon is not recommended for chronic use in the elderly. Sonata has been off patent since June 2008.

	The FDA&rsquo;s policy
	with regard to insomnia drugs has been changed due to concerns regarding next day alertness and functionality. To date, the two
	leading insomnia drugs that are indicated for both sleep induction and sleep maintenance are Zolpidem CR and Lunesta. In May 2013,
	the FDA announced that patients who take modified-release formulations of Zolpidem should refrain, for the day after using the
	drug, from driving or engaging in any activity that requires full alertness, even if the patient has slept for the required eight-hour
	period after taking the drug. Further, in January 2014, the FDA ordered a reduction of the recommended dosages of certain sleep
	drugs that contained Zolpidem by one half due to the decline in next day functionality and alertness of people using such drugs.
	According to the FDA, Zolpidem was the most widely used drug in prescription sleep medications in 2011. In May 2014, the FDA ordered
	a reduction of the recommended starting dose of Lunesta (eszopiclone) to the minimum approved dose because eszopiclone levels in
	some patients may be high enough the morning after use to impair activities that require alertness, including driving, even if
	the patients feel fully awake. Accordingly, we believe that, notwithstanding the expected minimal hangover effects of AP&ndash;ZP,
	the FDA will require the labeling for AP&ndash;ZP to carry a &ldquo;next day&rdquo; warning.

	a comprehensive solution for the treatment of insomnia. AP&ndash;ZP is designed, using our patented Accordion Pill technology,
	to induce and maintain sleep and minimize &ldquo;next-day&rdquo; residual side effects. Due to the short half-life of Zaleplon,
	minimal hangover effects are expected, improving on certain leading currently marketed treatments. However, as noted below, the

	A double-blind, three-way
	crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled proof of concept, or POC, study of AP&ndash;ZP was performed in two medical centers in
	Israel, following which a separate double-blind, two-way crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial of AP&ndash;ZP
	was conducted under an IND in five medical centers in the United States and in one medical center in Israel. The POC study was
	initiated in October 2010 and was completed in February 2011. The Phase II clinical trial of AP&ndash;ZP was initiated in April
	2011 and was completed in November 2011. Both studies assessed the efficacy, next day residual effects and safety in patients with
	primary insomnia, who experience difficulty both falling and staying asleep, comparing AP&ndash;ZP versus a placebo. Both studies
	assessed efficacy by using polysomnography, or PSG, a multi-parametric objective test for studying sleep conducted at night. The
	next day residual effect was assessed in both studies within one hour of waking using: Digital Symbol Substitution Test, or DSST,
	a neuropsychological test used to evaluate cognitive condition by having the patient match provided symbols to digits as quickly
	as possible, Visual Analog Scale, or VAS, a questionnaire aimed at measuring the patient&rsquo;s subjective impressions as to his
	or her cognitive condition, and memory testing.

	The POC study included
	ten patients with primary insomnia and tested two AP&ndash;ZP strengths. This study demonstrated a trend toward improved efficacy
	in reducing wake time after sleep onset, or WASO, with the high dose tested. Similar trends of improved efficacy were demonstrated
	in the latency to persistent sleep, or LPS, and total sleep time, or TST, with the same dose. No residual sedition was found by
	both DSST and VAS tests in both tested strengths.

	The Phase II clinical
	trial with AP&ndash;ZP assessed the efficacy and safety in 83 patients with primary insomnia, who experienced difficulty both falling
	and staying asleep, comparing AP&ndash;ZP versus a placebo. This trial used PSG. The patients each participated in six nights of
	PSG (two nights for each of screening, test formulation and placebo) with four to seven days between each treatment. The primary
	endpoint was TST, measured by both PSG and patient reports, with secondary endpoints of (i) effectiveness of sleep induction, measured
	as LPS and (ii) sleep maintenance, measured as WASO and number of awakenings. Residual effects were evaluated within one hour of
	waking using the DSST, VAS and memory testing. Safety was also evaluated.

	The primary endpoint
	of increased TST was achieved in the Phase II clinical trial. TST measured by PSG for patients after receiving the test article
	was 381 minutes, in comparison to 363.9 minutes for those same patients after receiving the placebo (statistically significant
	p =0.002). In addition, statistically significant improvement of LPS was achieved in the Phase II clinical trial as the mean LPS
	for patients after receiving the test article was 31 minutes, in comparison to 45 minutes for those same patients after receiving
	the placebo (statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). Thus, this trial revealed that when patients received AP&ndash;ZP they tended
	to fall asleep faster and sleep longer when compared to the placebo. This trial, through both DSST and VAS, demonstrated an important
	attribute of AP&ndash;ZP. AP&ndash;ZP did not show residual sedative effect when compared to a placebo. There were no clinically
	significant adverse events reported, and the drug was well-tolerated. The WASO for the entire night was similar between AP&ndash;ZP
	and the placebo; however, in a post hoc analysis, a statistically significant improvement of WASO in the first four hours of the
	night was demonstrated as WASO in the first four hours was 16.1 minutes for patients after receiving the test article, in comparison
	to 26.3 minutes for those same patients after receiving the placebo (statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001). In the post hoc analysis,
	gender differences were found in all efficacy tested parameters.

	After the FDA evaluates

	of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional
	clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements
	related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing, or any combination thereof. Even if such additional information
	is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve
	the NDA with restrictive indications, labeling that includes particular risk information, a risk evaluation and strategy to mitigate
	risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted
	distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other
	things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more
	post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further
	assess and monitor the product&rsquo;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.

	lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA
	until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement
	case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. This same procedure that applied to an ANDA applicant also applies to an NDA applicant

	A patent claiming
	a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration
	of up to five years for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted
	is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the
	submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of
	a patent past a total of 14 years from the product&rsquo;s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product
	is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in
	question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals.
	The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

	An additional patent
	family (i.e., Method and Apparatus for Forming Delivery Devices for Oral Intake of an Agent), which we refer to as IN-3, covers
	various methods for making and folding the gastroretentive drug delivery system, and for folding it in an accordion configuration
	allowing its integration into an ordinary oral capsule. The IN-3 family patents, which expire in 2027, except for the first United
	States patent of this family, which expires in 2028, allow the Accordion Pill to be manufactured in mass quantities and therefore
	to be more readily commercialized. We consider our licensed proprietary process for folding and cutting the films forming the drug
	delivery system for integration in an accordion-like configuration into an ordinary oral capsule to be material to our business.
	We have three granted patents in the U.S. and an additional pending patent application in connection with IN-3, as well as granted
	patents in Israel, Europe and Japan. Importantly, the second IN-3 patent granted in the U.S. covers a specific embodiment of the
	Accordion Pill, particularly suitable for insoluble or poorly soluble drugs. Similar divisional applications have been filed in
	other countries and patents for this have already been granted in Israel and Japan.

	Two additional patents
	families (i.e., Accordion Pill with Levodopa and Zaleplon as the active ingredient, respectively) that we consider material to
	our business, which we refer to as IN-7 and IN-8, respectively, relate to the integration of specific drugs into Accordion Pill
	products. The accordion technology covered by our other patents cannot be applied in an obvious manner to any given drug that might
	benefit from prolonged gastroretentive release. This is because the layer structure of an Accordion Pill must be varied and specially
	designed by reference to factors that are unique to any given drug and indication, such as the quantity of active ingredient desired
	to be released, the length of time for which the release is indicated, the relative solubility of the particular drug molecule,
	and other factors. IN-7 and IN-8 relate to applications to protect the specific integration of Levodopa and Zaleplon, respectively,
	into an Accordion Pill. The IN-7 patent family relates to the Accordion Pill dosage form, the main feature of which is the uniform
	inner drug-containing layer, which allows for, but does not require, high load of the drug, while maintaining the requisite structural
	or mechanical strength of the Accordion Pill. These two patent applications were each filed in the United States, the European
	Patent Office, Japan and several other countries in April 2009. We have three granted U.S. patents for an Accordion Pill with Carbidopa/Levodopa
	as the active ingredient(s) (IN-7), which are in force until April 17, 2029, and applications for this patent in Israel and in
	South Korea have been allowed.

	We intend to submit
	patent applications for each Accordion Pill and drug combination that we develop. The patent outlook for companies like ours is
	generally uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and consolidate our proprietary
	position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We
	do not know whether any of our patent applications or any patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any
	patents. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future, or patents that we exclusively license, may be challenged,
	narrowed, circumvented or found to be invalid or unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing
	related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. We cannot be certain that we were
	the first to invent the inventions claimed in our owned patents or patent applications, or that Yissum was the first to invent
	the invention claimed in the patent that we exclusively license from Yissum. In addition, our competitors may independently develop
	similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide
	us with any meaningful competitive advantages against these competitors. Furthermore, because of the extensive time required for
	development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized,
	any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage
	of the patent.

	expenditures, as determined by the research committee. The grantee is required to pay royalties to the State of Israel on income
	generated from the sale of products (and related services associated with such products), whether received by the grantee or any
	affiliated entity (as defined in the Royalty Regulations), developed, in whole or in part, within the framework of an OCS-funded

	sale of the first product developed according to an OCS-funded project at rates between 3% to 6% (though typically not greater
	than 4.5%) of sales of the product, depending on the situation and applicable criteria, and are payable until the repayment of
	the full amount of the total OCS funding, linked to the U.S. Dollar, and accrued interest (LIBOR), or in certain cases, payable
	up to the increased royalty cap. The terms of the Israeli government participation also require that products developed using government

	approval is received from the OCS (such approval is not required for the transfer of a portion of the manufacturing capacity which
	does not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the portion declared to be manufactured abroad in the applications for funding, in which

	We are a clinical
	stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing drugs based on our proprietary Accordion Pill platform technology, which
	we refer to as the Accordion Pill. Our Accordion Pill is an oral drug delivery system that is designed to improve the efficacy
	and safety of existing drugs and drugs in development by utilizing an efficient gastric retention, or GR, and specific release
	mechanism. Our product pipeline currently includes three product candidates in clinical trial stages. Our leading product candidate,
	Accordion Pill Carbidopa/Levodopa, or AP-CDLD, is being developed for the indication of treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease
	symptoms in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients. We have successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial for AP-CDLD
	for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients and have agreed with the
	U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, on the remaining clinical development program for AP-CDLD for the treatment of
	Parkinson&rsquo;s disease symptoms in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients, including the main principles of the single
	required pivotal Phase III clinical trial in advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients. See &ldquo;Business &mdash; Current
	Regulatory Status of AP-CDLD.&rdquo; In December 2015, we received a centralized U.S. IRB approval to initiate a Phase III clinical
	trial for AP-CDLD. See &ldquo;Business &mdash; Current Regulatory Status of AP-CDLD.&rdquo; Our second product candidate, Accordion
	Pill Zaleplon, or AP&ndash;ZP, is being developed for the indication of treatment of insomnia, including sleep induction and the
	improvement of sleep maintenance. We have successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial for AP&ndash;ZP for the treatment of
	insomnia under an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application that we submitted to the FDA on August 4, 2009 for AP&ndash;ZP
	as a treatment for the induction and maintenance of sleep in patients suffering from insomnia. In our correspondence with the
	FDA, the FDA previously agreed that an acceptable regulatory pathway for each of AP-CDLD and AP&ndash;ZP would be to file a new
	drug application, or NDA, pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. See &ldquo;Business
	&mdash; Government Regulation &mdash; 505(b)(2) Applications.&rdquo; The FDA has indicated in written correspondence to us that
	we may be able to design the development program for AP&ndash;ZP in a manner that would allow us to obtain sufficient data for
	the NDA submission for AP-ZP in one pivotal Phase III clinical trial. However, at this point in the development process of AP-ZP,
	the details of such a trial have not been determined or confirmed with the FDA. In March 2016, we completed a Phase I clinical
	trial for our third pipeline product candidate which is being developed for the prevention and treatment of gastroduodenal and
	small bowel NSAID induced ulcers. The PK results demonstrated in the Phase I trial were within the well-defined safety levels
	of the drug, which enable us to proceed with further development of the Accordion Pill with the existing drug.

	Our Accordion Pill
	platform technology is designed to increase the time that drugs are retained in the stomach as compared to other oral dosage forms,
	such as tablets and capsules. This capability is particularly important to drugs with a narrow absorption window, or NAW, which
	are absorbed mainly in the upper part of the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Regular controlled-release formulations of such drugs
	currently on the market sometimes fail to provide an efficient solution, as once the regular dosage form has passed the drug&rsquo;s
	NAW in the upper GI tract, the drug is not, or is very poorly, absorbed in the distal parts of the GI tract. The Accordion Pill
	platform technology is also designed for drugs with low solubility, which do not efficiently dissolve in the GI tract, and drugs
	with low permeability, which do not efficiently penetrate the intestinal wall and reach the blood stream, such as Biopharmaceutics
	Classification System, or BCS, Class II (low solubility, high permeability) and Class IV (low solubility, low permeability) drugs.
	According to The AAPS Journal published by the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, of the top 200 oral drugs in
	the United States, Great Britain, Spain and Japan in 2006, approximately 30% to 35% were BCS Class II drugs and approximately
	5% to 10% were BCS Class IV drugs. Further, according to Drug Development &amp; Delivery, in 2006 approximately 90% of new chemical
	entities, or NCEs, in development were either BCS Class II or Class IV drugs. The Accordion Pill&rsquo;s efficient GR and specific
	release mechanism prolongs the absorption phase of drugs with an NAW, which can result in significantly more stable plasma levels.
	In addition, the Accordion Pill has demonstrated an enhancement of the absorption of a poorly soluble, BCS Class II/IV drug in
	a crossover PK clinical study in 12 healthy volunteers. For poorly soluble drugs, we believe that our technology acts through
	the gradual delivery of an undissolved drug by the Accordion Pill in the stomach, which allows for the complete dissolution of
	the drug dose in the stomach over the delivery period. The gradual passage of the drug from the stomach to the upper part of the
	GI tract enables an increase in the amount of the drug that can be dissolved and thus absorbed, in the upper small bowel. In addition,
	we believe that bile secretion in the upper part of the GI tract also improves the intestinal environment for better absorption.
	Finally, the significant dilution of the drug solution in the small bowel caused by prolonged delivery increases the amount of
	the drug available for absorption.

	Our clinical trials
	to date have demonstrated that the Accordion Pill is retained in the stomach for eight to 12 hours, as compared to significantly
	shorter time periods, typically as little as two to three hours, when using other solid dosage forms. The efficient GR and the
	predetermined release profile for each specific drug associated with our Accordion Pill technology demonstrated a significant
	improvement in PK, which is the drug plasma level over time and a corresponding improvement in efficacy and safety.

	research organization expenses, clinical trials and pre-clinical trials, consulting expenses, APIs, and other similar expenses
	are recorded to the product candidate for which such expenses are incurred. However, salaries and related personnel expenses,
	indirect materials and costs for facilities and equipment are considered overhead and are shared among all of our product candidates
	and are not recorded on a product-by-product basis. Our direct costs related to product candidates other than AP&ndash;CDLD for
	2013, 2014 and 2015 were insignificant. We expect our research and development expense to remain our primary expense in the near

	This discussion and
	analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in
	accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates
	that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities and expenses. Significant accounting policies employed by us, including
	the use of estimates, are presented in the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. We periodically
	evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to
	be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our
	financial condition and results of operations and require management&rsquo;s subjective or complex judgments, resulting in the
	need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual performance should
	differ from historical experience or if the underlying assumptions were to change, our financial condition and results of operations
	may be materially impacted.

	The investors in
	our August 2013 financing round had the benefit of anti-dilution protection until the occurrence of the earliest of one of the
	following events: (1) the consummation of an initial public offering of our ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Stock Market in which
	we raise at least $12.0 million or a merger with a company traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market which immediately following the closure
	of such merger holds free and unencumbered cash and/or publically raised, prior to September 30, 2014, a cumulative amount of
	at least $12.0 million, (2) the consummation of a merger or acquisition event, or an M&amp;A Event, or (3) four years from the
	execution of the investment agreement. During this period, in the event of the occurrence of an M&amp;A Event or new investment
	in our company at a price per share that is lower than NIS 66.93, or the Protection Threshold Price, an investor who still held
	ordinary shares purchased in the August 2013 financing round was entitled to Downside Protection. As a result of anti-dilution
	shares issued to investors in our August 2013 financing round following our October 2014 rights offering, the Protection Threshold
	Price was effectively reduced to NIS 32.65. The sale of ordinary shares in our initial public offering in the United States at
	the initial public offering price of $6.00 per share required us to issue 174,566 ordinary shares to investors in our August 2013
	financing round as a result of the Downside Protection based on 192,398 ordinary shares held by investors in our August 2013 financing
	round as of August 3, 2015 and the exercise price of the related warrants still held by investors in our August 2013 financing
	round was reduced from NIS 35 to NIS 21.7. The Downside Protection mechanism that was terminated following the initial public
	offering in the U.S. was accounted for as financial liability that was a financial derivative instrument. Under the terms of the
	investment agreement, the investors have the right to exercise the warrants into shares through a net-settlement mechanism. This
	net-settlement mechanism is accounted for as financial liability that is a financial derivative instrument.

	Prior to the consummation
	of our initial public offering in the United States, these liabilities were measured at fair value using the Monte Carlo model,
	a standard valuation technique for this type of instrument, on the basis of observable inputs (such as the price of our shares,
	the risk-free interest and the exercise price) and unobservable inputs (such as expected volatility, expected life and the probability
	of potential scenarios as described in the investment agreement). Following the consummation of our initial public offering in
	the United States, the financial liability of the net-settlement mechanism is measured at fair value using a standard valuation
	technique for this type of instrument (Black-Scholes model) on the basis of various parameters (such as the price of the Company's
	shares, expected life, expected volatility, risk-free interest and exercise price).

	Prior to the consummation

	Capital Market rules and external director under the Companies Law overlap to a significant degree such that we would generally
	expect the two directors serving as external directors to satisfy the requirements to be independent under the NASDAQ Capital
	Market rules. The definition of external director includes a set of statutory criteria that must be satisfied, including criteria
	whose aim is to ensure that there is no factor which would impair the ability of the external director to exercise independent
	judgment. The definition of independent director specifies similar, if slightly less stringent, requirements in addition to the
	requirement that the board consider any factor which would impair the ability of the independent director to exercise independent
	judgment. In addition, our external directors each serve for a period of three years. However, external directors must be elected
	by a special majority of shareholders while independent directors may be elected by a simple majority. See &ldquo;&mdash; External

	cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, the holders of a majority of the voting power represented at a shareholders
	meeting have the power to elect all of our directors, subject to the special approval requirements for external directors (See

	Under the Companies
	Law, the board of directors of a public company must appoint a compensation committee and adopt a compensation policy. The compensation
	committee must be comprised of at least three directors, including all of the external directors, who must constitute a majority
	of the members of the compensation committee, and one of the external directors must serve as chairman of the committee. However,
	subject to certain exceptions, Israeli companies whose securities are traded on stock exchanges such as the NASDAQ Capital Market,
	and who do not have a controlling shareholder, do not have to meet this majority requirement; provided, however, that the compensation
	committee meets other Companies Law composition requirements, as well as the requirements of the jurisdiction where the company&rsquo;s
	securities are listed. Each compensation committee member that is not an external director must be a director whose compensation
	does not exceed an amount that may be paid to an external director (under the Companies Law and applicable regulations). The compensation
	committee is subject to the same Companies Law restrictions as the audit committee as to who may not be a member of the committee.

	shareholders by a simple majority, provided that (i) such majority includes a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders who
	are not controlling shareholders and who do not have a personal interest in the matter, present and voting (abstentions are disregarded)

	A personal interest furthermore includes the personal interest of a person for whom the office holder holds a voting proxy or
	the personal interest of the office holder with respect to his or her vote on behalf of a person for whom he or she holds a proxy
	even if such shareholder has no personal interest in the matter. An office holder is not however, obligated to disclose a personal

	If it is determined
	that an office holder has a personal interest in a transaction, approval by the board of directors is required for the transaction,
	unless the company&rsquo;s articles of association provide for a different method of approval. Our articles of association do
	not provide otherwise. Further, so long as an office holder has disclosed his or her personal interest in a transaction, the board
	of directors may approve an action by the office holder that would otherwise be deemed a breach of the duty of loyalty. However,
	a company may not approve a transaction or action that is adverse to the company&rsquo;s interest or that is not performed by
	the office holder in good faith. An extraordinary transaction in which an office holder has a personal interest requires approval
	of the company&rsquo;s audit committee followed by the approval of the board of directors. The compensation of, or an undertaking
	to indemnify or insure, an office holder who is not a director requires approval by the company&rsquo;s compensation committee,
	followed by the approval of the company&rsquo;s board of directors, and, if such compensation arrangement or an undertaking to
	indemnify or insure is inconsistent with the company&rsquo;s stated compensation policy, or if the said office holder is the Chief
	Executive Officer (apart from a number of specific exceptions), then such arrangement is subject to the approval of a majority
	vote of the shares present and voting at a shareholders meeting, provided that either: (a) such majority includes at least a majority
	of the shares held by all shareholders who are not controlling shareholders and do not have a personal interest in such compensation
	arrangement (excluding abstaining shareholders); or (b) the total number of shares of non-controlling shareholders and shareholders
	who do not have a personal interest in the compensation arrangement and who vote against the arrangement does not exceed 2% of
	the company&rsquo;s aggregate voting rights. We refer to this as the Special Approval for Compensation. Arrangements regarding
	the compensation, indemnification or insurance of a director require the approvals of the compensation committee, board of directors
	and shareholders by simple majority, and under certain circumstances, a Special Approval for Compensation.

	Israeli labor laws
	principally govern the length of the workday, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees, determination
	of severance pay, annual leave, sick days, advance notice of termination of employment, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination
	laws and other conditions of employment. Subject to certain exceptions, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the
	retirement, death or dismissal of an employee, and requires us and our employees to make payments to the National Insurance Institute,
	which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Our employees have defined benefit pension plans that comply with
	applicable Israeli legal requirements, which also include the mandatory pension payments required by applicable law and allocations

	The Companies Law
	provides that a shareholder, in exercising his or her rights and performing his or her obligations toward the company and its
	other shareholders, must act in good faith and in a customary manner, and avoid abusing his or her power. This is required when
	voting at general meetings on matters such as changes to the articles of association, increasing the company&rsquo;s registered
	capital, mergers and approval of certain interested or related party transactions. A shareholder also has a general duty to refrain
	from depriving any other shareholder of its rights as a shareholder. In addition, any controlling shareholder, any shareholder
	who knows that its vote can determine the outcome of a shareholder&rsquo;s vote and any shareholder who, under such company&rsquo;s
	articles of association, can appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder or other power towards the company, is required
	to act with fairness towards the company. The Companies Law does not describe the substance of this duty except that the remedies
	generally available upon a breach of contract will also apply to a breach of the duty to act with fairness, and, to the best of
	our knowledge, there is no binding case law that addresses this subject directly.

	all the aspects of Israeli tax law that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of his or her personal investment circumstances
	or to some types of investors subject to special treatment under Israeli law. Examples of this kind of investor include traders
	in securities or persons that own, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our outstanding voting capital, all of whom are subject
	to special tax regimes not covered in this discussion. Some parts of this discussion are based on a new tax legislation which

	As
	of January 1, 2014, any distribution of dividends from income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise is generally subject to a tax
	at a rate of 20%. However, if such dividends are distributed to an Israeli company, no tax is imposed. As of January 1, 2014,
	dividends distributed from income attributed to an Approved Enterprise and/or a Benefited Enterprise are subject to a tax rate
	of 20%. Notwithstanding the above, a reduced 15% tax rate will be applicable if the dividend was distributed out of income of:
	(i) Approved Enterprise activated prior to 2014; or (ii) Benefited Enterprise with a &ldquo;Year of Election&rdquo; prior to 2014.

	A distribution of
	dividends from income, which is not attributed to an Approved Enterprise/Benefited Enterprise/Preferred Enterprise to an Israeli
	resident individual, will generally be subject to income tax at a rate of 25%. However, a 30% tax rate will apply if the dividend
	recipient is a &ldquo;Controlling Shareholder&rdquo; (as defined above) at the time of distribution or at any time during the
	preceding 12 months period. If the recipient of the dividend is an Israeli resident corporation, such dividend will be exempt
	from income tax provided the income from which such dividend is distributed was derived or accrued within Israel. The Ordinance
	generally provides that a non-Israeli resident (either individual or corporation) is subject to an Israeli income tax on the receipt
	of dividends at the rate of 25% (30% if the dividends recipient is a &ldquo;Controlling Shareholder&rdquo; (as defined above),
	at the time of distribution or at any time during the preceding 12 months period); those rates are subject to a reduced tax rate

	Thus, under the U.S.-Israel
	Double Tax Treaty the following rates will apply in respect of dividends distributed by an Israeli resident company to a U.S.
	resident: (i) with regard to a dividend distributed from income which is not attributed to an Approved Enterprise/ Benefited Enterprise/
	Preferred Enterprise, if the U.S. resident is a corporation which holds during that portion of the taxable year which precedes
	the date of payment of the dividend and during the whole of its prior taxable year (if any), at least 10% of the outstanding shares
	of the voting stock of the Israeli resident paying corporation and not more than 25% of the gross income of the Israeli resident
	paying corporation for such prior taxable year (if any) consists of certain type of interest or dividends &ndash; the maximum
	tax rate of withholding is 12.5% if a certificate for a reduced withholding tax rate would be provided in advance from the Israeli
	Tax Authority, (ii) with regard to a dividend distributed from income derived from an Approved Enterprise/ Benefited Enterprise/
	Preferred Enterprise under the Investments Law, if the U.S. resident is a corporation which holds during that portion of the taxable
	year which precedes the date of payment of the dividend and during the whole of its prior taxable year (if any), at least 10%
	of the outstanding shares of the voting stock of the Israeli resident paying corporation and not more than 25% of the gross income
	of the Israeli resident paying corporation for such prior taxable year (if any) consists of certain type of interest or dividends,
	and given the fact that the text of the U.S.-Israel Double Tax Treaty has not been updated, the tax rate of withholding 15% will
	be applicable if a certificate for a reduced withholding tax rate would be provided in advance from the Israeli Tax Authority,
	and (iii) in all other cases, the tax rate is 25%, or the domestic rate (if such is lower). The aforementioned rates under the
	Israel U.S. Double Tax Treaty will not apply if the dividend income was derived through a permanent establishment of the U.S.
	resident in Israel.

	This summary is based on the Code, the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued pursuant to the Code, or the
	Treasury Regulations, the income tax treaty between the United States and Israel (the &ldquo;U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty&rdquo;), and
	administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change,
	possibly with retroactive effect, or to different interpretation. No ruling has been sought from the IRS with respect to any U.S.
	federal income tax consequences described below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary
	position. This summary is for general information purposes only, it does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all
	potential U.S. federal income tax considerations that may apply to a U.S. Investor as a result of the purchase, ownership, and
	disposition of our ordinary shares, and it does not constitute tax advice. This summary does not address all of the tax considerations
	that may be relevant to specific U.S. Investors in light of their particular circumstances or to U.S. Investors subject to special

	and, to the extent they exceed that tax basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of those ordinary shares. We

	on the date such dividend is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. If the dividend
	is converted to U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Investor generally will not recognize a foreign currency gain or loss.
	However, if the U.S. Investor converts the NIS into U.S. dollars on a later date, the U.S. Investor must include, in computing
	its income, any gain or loss resulting from any exchange rate fluctuations. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between
	(i) the U.S. dollar value of the amount included in income when the dividend was received and (ii) the amount received on the
	conversion of the NIS into U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss will generally be ordinary income or loss and United States source
	for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. U.S. Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them

	Subject to certain

	or withheld from a U.S. Investor that year. Dividends paid on the ordinary shares generally will constitute income from sources
	outside the United States, which may be relevant in calculating a U.S. Investor&rsquo;s foreign tax credit limitation. The limitation
	on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. For this purpose, dividends

	Certain distributions
	treated as dividends that are received by an individual U.S. Investor from &ldquo;qualified foreign corporations&rdquo; generally

	U.S. Investor will not be eligible for reduced U.S. federal income tax rate with respect to dividend distributions on ordinary
	shares if (a) such U.S. Investor has not held the ordinary shares for at least 61 days during the 121-day period starting on the
	date which is 60 days before, and ending 60 days after the ex-dividend date, (b) to the extent the U.S. Investor is under an obligation
	to make related payments on substantially similar or related property or (c) with respect to any portion of a dividend that is
	taken into account by the U.S. Investor as investment income under Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Code. Any days during which the
	U.S. Investor has diminished its risk of loss with respect to ordinary shares (for example, by holding an option to sell the ordinary
	shares) are not counted towards meeting the 61-day holding period. Non-corporate U.S. Investors should consult their own tax advisors
	concerning whether dividends received by them qualify for the reduced rate of tax.

	.&emsp;Subject to the discussion under &ldquo;&mdash; Passive Foreign Investment Company&rdquo;
	below, a U.S. Investor generally will recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our ordinary
	shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition and the U.S.
	Investor&rsquo;s adjusted tax basis in such ordinary shares. The adjusted tax basis in an ordinary share generally will be equal
	to the cost basis of such ordinary share. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Investor&rsquo;s
	holding period in our ordinary shares exceeds one year. Preferential tax rates for long-term capital gain (currently, with a maximum
	rate of 20%) will apply to individual U.S. Investors. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. The gain
	or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, possibly
	subject to certain exceptions under the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty. Additionally, certain losses may be treated as foreign source
	to the extent certain dividends were received by the U.S. Investor within the 24-month period preceding the date on which the
	U.S. Investor recognized the loss. The additional 3.8% net investment income tax (described below) may apply to gains recognized
	upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our ordinary shares by certain U.S. Investors who meet the modified adjusted

	In general, a corporation
	organized outside the United States will be treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which
	either (i) at least 75% of its gross income is &ldquo;passive income&rdquo; or (ii) on average at least 50% of its assets by value
	produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income for this purpose generally includes, among
	other things, certain dividends, interest, royalties, rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions and from the
	sale or exchange of property that gives rise to passive income. Passive income also includes amounts derived by reason of the
	temporary investment of funds, including those raised in a public offering. Assets that produce or are held for the production
	of passive income include, among other things, cash, even if held as working capital or raised in a public offering, marketable
	securities and other assets that may produce passive income. In determining whether a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC, a proportionate
	share of the income and assets of each corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, at least a 25% interest (by value)
	is taken into account.

	A foreign corporation&rsquo;s

	in part by reference to our market capitalization, a decline in the value of our ordinary shares may result in our becoming a

	QEF Election
</I>
	.&emsp;One
	way in which certain of the adverse consequences of PFIC status can be mitigated is for a U.S. Investor to make a QEF election.
	Generally, a shareholder making the QEF election is required for each taxable year to include in income a pro rata share of the
	ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, subject to a separate election to defer payment of taxes, which deferral is
	subject to an interest charge. An election to treat us as a QEF will not be available if we do not provide the information necessary

	.&emsp;Alternatively, if our ordinary shares are treated as &ldquo;marketable stock,&rdquo; a U.S. Investor would
	be allowed to make a &ldquo;mark-to-market&rdquo; election with respect to our ordinary shares, provided the U.S. Investor completes
	and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions and related Treasury Regulations. If that election is made,
	the U.S. Investor generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value
	of our ordinary shares at the end of the taxable year over such holder&rsquo;s adjusted tax basis in such ordinary shares. Thus,
	the U.S. Investor may recognize taxable income without receiving any cash to pay its tax liability with respect to such income.
	The U.S. Investor would also be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the U.S. Investor&rsquo;s adjusted
	tax basis in our ordinary shares over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net
	amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A U.S. Investor&rsquo;s tax basis in our ordinary
	shares would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount. Gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of
	our ordinary shares would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our
	ordinary shares would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously
	included in income by the U.S. Investor, and any loss in excess of such amount will be treated as capital loss. Amounts treated
	as ordinary income will not be eligible for the favorable tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income or long-term capital
	gains.

	On August 7, 2015,

	On September 18, 2015, the underwriters&rsquo; exercised their underwriters&rsquo; option in part to purchase an additional 638,750
	ordinary shares to cover over-allotments, for aggregate gross offering proceeds of approximately $34.0 million. Maxim Group LLC
	and Roth Capital Partners acted as joint book-running managers of the offering. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the
	offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-1, which was declared effective
	on August 3, 2015 (File No. 333-204836).

	We follow the provisions of the Companies Law with respect to matters

	to the Chief Executive Officer and all other executive officers of a company. However,
	the Companies Law requires that each of our audit and compensation committees be comprised
	of at least three members, including all of our external directors, and that the external
	or independent directors must constitute a majority of the members of each committee.
	See &ldquo;Management &mdash; Board Practices &mdash; External Directors.&rdquo; In addition,
	the Companies Law requires that additional members of the compensation committee and
	the external directors be compensated equally. Our compensation committee has been established
	and conducts itself in accordance with the provisions governing the composition of and
	the responsibilities of a compensation committee as set forth in the Companies Law. Furthermore,
	compensation of office holders is determined and approved by our compensation committee,
	and in general, by our board of directors as well, and in certain circumstances by our
	shareholders. Thus, we will seek shareholder approval for all corporate actions with
	respect to office holder compensation (including the compensation required to be approved
	for our chief executive officer) requiring such approval under the requirements of the
	Companies Law, including seeking prior approval of the shareholders for the compensation
	policy and for certain office holder compensation, rather than seeking approval for such
	corporate actions in accordance with Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market. For
	more information, see &ldquo;Compensation Committee and Compensation Policy.&rdquo;

	.&emsp;We
	will seek shareholder approval for all corporate actions requiring such approval under
	the requirements of the Companies Law, rather than seeking approval for corporate actions
	in accordance with NASDAQ Capital Market Listing Rule 5635. In particular, under this
	NASDAQ Capital Market rule, shareholder approval is generally required for: (i) an acquisition
	of shares or assets of another company that involves the issuance of 20% or more of the
	acquirer&rsquo;s shares or voting rights or if a director, officer or 5% shareholder
	has greater than a 5% interest in the target company or the consideration to be received;
	(ii) the issuance of shares leading to a change of control; (iii) adoption or amendment
	of equity compensation arrangements; and (iv) issuances of 20% or more of the shares
	or voting rights (including securities convertible into, or exercisable for, equity)
	of a listed company via a private placement (or via sales by directors, officers or 5%
	shareholders) if such equity is issued (or sold) at below the greater of the book or
	market value of shares. By contrast, under the Companies Law, shareholder approval is
	required for, among other things: (a) transactions with directors concerning the terms
	of their service or indemnification, exemption and insurance for their service (or for
	any other position that they may hold at a company), for which approvals of the compensation
	committee, board of directors and shareholders are all required, (b) extraordinary transactions
	with controlling shareholders of publicly held companies, which require the special approval
	further described under &ldquo;Disclosure of personal interests of controlling shareholders
	and approval of certain transactions,&rdquo; (c) terms of office and employment or other
	engagement of our controlling shareholder, if any, or such controlling shareholder&rsquo;s
	relative, which require the special approval further described under &ldquo;Disclosure
	of personal interests of controlling shareholders and approval of certain transactions,&rdquo;
	(d) approval of transactions with our Chief Executive Officer with respect to his or
	her compensation, whether in accordance with our approved compensation policy or not
	in accordance with our
<B>
</B>
	approved compensation policy, or transactions with our
	officers not in accordance with our approved compensation policy, and (e) approval of
	our compensation policy for office holders. In addition, under the Companies Law, a merger
	requires approval of the shareholders of each of the merging companies. See also &ldquo;Additional
	Information &mdash; Memorandum and Articles of Association &mdash; Merger.&rdquo;

	also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Company's Board of Directors and

	In our opinion, the financial statements

	We draw your attention to note 1a(2) to
	the financial statements, which notes that the Company has not yet generated any revenues from its operations and has cumulative
	losses (as of December 31, 2015 the cumulative losses were approximately NIS 193 million). The Company&rsquo;s current cash resources
	are not sufficient to complete the research and development of all of its products. Management expects that the Company will continue
	to incur losses in the foreseeable future from its activities, which will result in negative cash flows from operating activities.
	If the Company is unsuccessful in funding its plans, it may need to make the necessary changes to its operations to reduce the
	level of expenditures in line with available resources.

	instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for
	financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. The basis
	of classification depends on the entity&rsquo;s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial
	asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable
	option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. Further, the expected credit losses model
	replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities, there were no changes to classification
	and measurement except for the recognition of changes in the Company's own credit risk in other comprehensive income for liabilities
	designated at fair value through profit or loss.

	192,398 ordinary shares with no par value. These warrants are exercisable over a period
	of four years from the date of their issuance for an exercise price of NIS 64.14. Under

	On August 30, 2011, the Company
	entered into an agreement with an international manufacturer for ordering an automated production line for Accordion Pills. The
	order covers engineering design and planning, and amounted to approximately NIS 1.3 million. In May 2013, the Company entered
	into a follow on order to manufacture and assemble the automated production line in the amount of approximately NIS 9.3 million.
	On September 1, 2015, the installation of the automated production line was completed. As of December 31, 2015 the Company paid
	the full amount of this order. The Company's management estimates that the useful life of the automated production line is 7 years
	and should be depreciated by the straight-line method.

	On December 31, 2014, the Board
	of Directors approved, further to a recommendation of the Compensation Committee, effective
	January 1, 2015, the appointment of the Company's Chief Financial Officer (&quot;CFO&quot;).
	As part of his employment agreement, a grant of 20,000 options was approved. Each option
	will be exercisable into one ordinary share, each for an exercise price of NIS 27.93.
	The options will vest over a four-year period, with half of the options vesting at the
