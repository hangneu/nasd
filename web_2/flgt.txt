	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a
	rapidly growing technology company with an initial focus on offering comprehensive genetic testing to provide physicians with clinically actionable diagnostic information they can use to improve the overall quality of patient care. We have developed
	a proprietary technology platform that integrates sophisticated data comparison and suppression algorithms, adaptive learning software, advanced genetic diagnostics tools and integrated laboratory processes. This platform allows us to offer a broad
	and flexible test menu while maintaining accessible pricing, high accuracy and competitive turnaround times. We believe our current test menu offers more genes for testing than our competitors in today&#146;s market, which enables us to provide
	expansive options for test customization and clinically actionable results. Our current test menu includes more than 18,000 single-gene tests and more than 200 pre-established, multi-gene, disease-specific panels that collectively test for more than
	7,500 genetic conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Genetic testing has experienced
	significant growth in recent years. As this trend continues, we believe genetic testing will become a more accepted part of standard medical care and the knowledge of a person&#146;s unique genetic makeup will begin to play a more important role in
	the practice of medicine. The advent of next generation sequencing, or NGS, technology, a relatively new genetic testing technique that enables millions of DNA fragments to be sequenced in parallel, has dramatically lowered the cost and improved the
	quality of genetic testing, contributing to increased adoption. According to GrandView Research, the size of the global NGS genetic testing market, which includes presequencing, sequencing and data analysis, is estimated to be approximately $4.0
	billion in 2016, including approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion in the United States, and is expected to reach approximately $10.5 billion by 2022, including approximately $3.6&nbsp;billion in the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While adoption of genetic testing has increased in recent years, we believe widespread utilization has been limited in large part because of
	certain barriers to adoption that exist in today&#146;s market. Among these barriers are that genetic testing can be prohibitively expensive, only a limited number of genetic tests are currently reimbursable, certain genetic conditions cannot be
	diagnosed due to the limited scope of genetic analysis, genetic testing can be an inefficient process and the interpretation of genetic results can be cumbersome and time-consuming. We believe a significant market exists for a genetic testing option
	that provides broad genetic coverage and the flexibility to customize tests for individual patient needs, while maintaining accuracy and affordability.

	We have developed a proprietary technology platform that we believe enables us to overcome
	many of the challenges facing our industry today. Our technology platform includes proprietary gene probes, advanced database algorithms, adaptive learning software and proprietary laboratory management systems. Together, the elements of our
	technology platform enable us to provide tests at a low cost to us and accessible price points to our customers, offer a broad test menu and continually expand and improve our proprietary genetic reference library. In addition, our technology
	platform allows us to offer customers the ability to design customized tests tailored to their specifications using our expansive library of genes, and we believe this flexibility increases efficiency and the utility of the genetic data we produce.
	Further, our gene probes, when combined with our proprietary genetic reference library and publicly available genetic databases, support our ability to sequence DNA regions that we believe laboratories using commercial probes cannot and improve the
	detection rate of our test data. In turn, we believe this enables us to produce clinically actionable results physicians can use to improve care for their patients.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our existing customer base consists primarily of hospitals and medical institutions, which are frequent and high-volume users of genetic tests
	and which typically pay us directly for our tests. We believe our relationships with these customers provide an avenue for further growth as we seek to deepen these relationships and drive increased ordering. We believe the key to further
	penetrating our existing customer base and expanding into new customer markets is to continue to focus on delivering a superior test menu while maintaining affordable prices. In order to offer our customers affordable price points, we continue to
	enhance our technology platform to develop tests that we can perform at a low internal cost.

	Department of Public Health, or CA DPH. We have assembled a highly qualified team of 55 employees as of September&nbsp;1, 2016, including 26 individuals with a PhD or other advanced degree and personnel with expertise in a number of fields important
	to our business, such as bioinformatics, genetics, software engineering, laboratory management and sales and marketing. We have relied upon this team to develop our proprietary technology platform and differentiated business model, which we believe
	have driven our commercial success to date and provide us with significant opportunity for future growth.

	After
	launching our first commercial genetic tests focused on rare pediatric diseases in 2013, our tests covered more than 1,000 genes in 100 panels by the first quarter of 2014 and more than 10,000 genes in over 170 panels by the end of 2015. Today, we
	have further expanded our test menu to offer more than 18,000 single-gene tests and more than 200 panels that collectively test for more than 7,500 genetic conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. We
	offer tests at competitive prices, averaging approximately $1,400 per billable test delivered in the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016, and with competitive turnaround times. Our volume has grown rapidly since our commercial launch, with over
	13,000 billable tests delivered to over 600 total customers as of June&nbsp;30, 2016. We delivered 6,852 billable tests in 2015 compared to 966 billable tests delivered in 2014, and we delivered 5,209 billable tests in the six months ended
	June&nbsp;30, 2016 compared to 2,762 billable tests delivered in the six months ended June 30, 2015. We have experienced compound quarterly growth of 19.5% in the number of billable tests delivered from the first quarter of 2015 through the second
	quarter of 2016. Further, approximately 86% of our test billings that were generated and due in 2015 were paid during that period. We recorded revenue and net loss of $9.6 million and $8.3 million in 2015, respectively, and revenue and net loss of
	$7.4&nbsp;million and $5.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.

	In recent years, there have been numerous advances in the analysis of large amounts of genomic information and the role of genetics
	and gene variants in disease diagnosis and treatment. Our industry has been and will continue to be characterized by rapid technological change, increasing amounts of data, frequent introductions of new genetic tests and evolving industry standards,
	all of which could make our tests obsolete if we are not able to enhance our technologies and tests faster and better than our competitors to maintain our competitive advantage. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the
	evolving needs of our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner and to pursue new market opportunities that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances. If we are not able to keep pace with technological advances and increased

	have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Our revenue growth may not increase or even continue, we may not achieve profitability and, if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.
	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and inhibits our ability to forecast our future operating results, including revenue, cash flows and profitability. For example, our gross profit during the last three
	months of 2015 was less than our gross profit in the preceding and subsequent three months. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to determine if these fluctuations reflect seasonality in our performance or are the result of other events.
	We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in the life sciences and technology industries, such as risks related to an evolving and unpredictable business model, management
	of growth and other uncertainties described in this prospectus. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or these risks and uncertainties change due to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks

	To achieve our anticipated revenue growth, we must increase test volume by further penetrating our existing hospital and medical institution
	customers. In addition, we must grow our customer base beyond hospitals and medical institutions and into additional customer groups, such as individual physicians, other practitioners and research institutions. For example, in 2016, we have
	contracted with a regional physician services organization based in Southern California and a national health insurance company to become an in-network provider and we have enrolled as a supplier in the Medicare program and nine state Medicaid
	programs. We have also established a vendor code with, and started to receive orders from, a national clinical laboratory that orders our tests to fulfill some of the genetic testing orders it receives from certain U.S. government agencies.
	Establishing these relationships means that we have agreed with the applicable payor or laboratory to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates, but it does not obligate this laboratory or any physicians to order our tests at any agreed
	volume or frequency or at all. As a result, these relationships, or any similar relationships we may establish in the future, may not amount to meaningful increases in our customer base, the number of billable tests we sell or our total revenue, or
	improve our ability to achieve profitability. We may not succeed in facilitating the clinical acceptance and adoption of our tests needed to achieve the increased volumes and customer growth we expect. Because detailed genetic data from tests such
	as ours have only recently become available at relatively affordable prices, the pace and degree of market acceptance and adoption of these tests is uncertain.

	Our business depends upon our ability to provide reliable and accurate test results that incorporate rapidly evolving information about the
	role of genes and gene variants in disease and clinically relevant outcomes associated with those variants. Hundreds of genes can be implicated in some disorders and overlapping networks of genes and symptoms can be implicated in multiple
	conditions. As a result, a substantial amount of judgment is required in order to interpret the results of each test we perform and produce a report summarizing these results. Errors, such as failures to detect genomic variants with high accuracy,
	or mistakes, such as failures to completely and correctly identify the significance of gene variants, could subject us to product liability or professional liability claims. A product liability or professional liability claim against us could result
	in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming to defend. Although we maintain liability insurance, including for errors and omissions, our insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of
	claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of any such claims. Any liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.

	We are currently focused on providing our tests to hospitals and medical institutions. These
	customers are typically able to pay for the cost of our tests using funds reimbursed in connection with a patient&#146;s diagnosis related group, or DRG. However, our ability to collect payment for the tests we perform is subject to a number of
	risks, many of which are not within our control, including risks of default or bankruptcy by the party responsible for payment and other risks associated with payment collection generally. Further, healthcare policy changes that influence the way
	healthcare is financed or other changes in the market that impact payment rates by institutional or non-institutional customers could affect our collection rates. For example, because reimbursement under a DRG is typically provided at a fixed amount
	intended to cover all services provided to the patient, the cost of our tests may be viewed to limit the profitability of the billing institution. If we are unable to convince hospitals and medical institutions of the value and benefit provided by
	our tests, or if the amount reimbursed under these DRG codes was decreased, these customers may slow, or stop altogether, their purchasing of our tests.

	Coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including managed care organizations, private health insurers and

	our tests unless third-party payors cover and provide adequate reimbursement for a substantial portion of the price of our tests. If we are not able to obtain coverage and an acceptable level of reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors,
	there would typically be a greater co-insurance or co-payment requirement from the patient for whom the test is ordered or the patient may be forced to pay the entire cost of the test out-of-pocket, which could dissuade practitioners from ordering

	Coverage and reimbursement by a

	contract to cover our tests and the amount it will reimburse for a test, and seeking the determination by a payor to cover and the amount it will reimburse for our tests would likely be made on an indication-by-indication basis. In addition, the
	coding procedure used by all third-party payors with respect to establishing payment rates for various procedures, including our tests, is complex, does not currently adapt well to the genetic tests we perform and may not enable coverage and
	adequate reimbursement rates for our tests. As a result, obtaining approvals from third-party payors to cover our tests and establishing adequate reimbursement levels is an unpredictable, challenging, time-consuming and costly process and we may

	To date, we have contracted with a regional physician services organization and a national health insurance company
	to become an in-network provider. We also recently enrolled as a supplier in the Medicare program and we have enrolled in nine state Medicaid programs, but we have not obtained any coverage, pricing or reimbursement approvals from any countries
	outside of the United States. Although becoming an in-network provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates, it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests
	or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels. Thus, these payor relationships, or any similar relationships we may establish in the future, may not result in acceptable levels of
	reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base or the number of billable tests we sell to physicians. We expect to focus on increasing coverage and reimbursement for our current tests and any future tests we may
	develop. We believe it may take several years to achieve coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with a majority of third-party payors. However, we cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payors will cover

	or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. Pursuant to its authority under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices,
	which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic products, or IVDs, used for clinical purposes. The tests that we offer are IVDs. Among other things, pursuant to the FDC Act and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates
	the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion, and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed

	Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including IVDs, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the
	FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDC Act and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, which are a subset of IVDs that are intended for clinical use and
	designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. We believe our tests fall within the definition of an LDT. As a result, we believe our diagnostic tests are not currently subject to the FDA&#146;s enforcement of its medical device
	regulations and the applicable FDC Act provisions.

	Even though we commercialize our tests as LDTs, our tests may in the future become
	subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA. For example, the FDA may disagree with our assessment that our tests fall within the definition of an LDT and seek to regulate our tests as medical devices. Moreover, pursuant to the Food and Drug
	Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, the FDA notified Congress on July&nbsp;31, 2014 that the FDA intended to issue in 60 days a draft guidance entitled &#147;Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests
	(LDTs),&#148; or the Framework Guidance, and a separate draft guidance entitled &#147;FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs),&#148; or the Notification Guidance. On October&nbsp;3, 2014, the FDA issued
	the anticipated Framework Guidance and Notification Guidance. The Framework Guidance states that the FDA intends to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs in a risk-based manner consistent with the existing classification
	of medical devices. Thus, the FDA plans to begin to enforce its medical device requirements, including premarket submission requirements, for LDTs that have historically been marketed without FDA premarket review and oversight. The FDA states its
	intention in the Framework Guidance to require registration or listing and adverse event reporting six months after the Framework Guidance is finalized and to publish general LDT classification guidance within 24 months of the date on which the
	Framework Guidance is finalized. According to the Framework Guidance, the FDA intends to enforce premarket review requirements in a risk-based, phased-in manner, starting with the highest risk LDTs beginning 12 months after the Framework Guidance is
	finalized, followed by other high risk LDTs in the next four years, and then moderate risk LDTs in the four years after that. Generally, for each category of LDTs, the FDA intends to continue exercising enforcement discretion pending the FDA&#146;s
	review and consideration of the premarket submissions for devices that are already in use at the time&#151;so long as premarket submissions are timely made. However, for certain categories of the highest risk LDTs (specifically, (i) LDTs with the
	same intended use as a cleared or approved companion diagnostic; (ii) LDTs with the same intended use as an FDA-approved Class III medical device; and (iii) certain LDTs for determining the safety or efficacy of blood or blood products), the FDA
	intends to begin enforcing premarket review requirements immediately upon publication of the finalized Framework Guidance for all new LDTs in those categories.

	enforcement policies affecting LDTs may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our tests and to develop and introduce new tests in the future. Additionally, if and when the FDA begins to actively enforce its
	premarket submission regulations with respect to LDTs generally or our tests in particular, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance for our tests under Section&nbsp;510(k) of the FDC Act or approval of a premarket approval application, or

	The premarket review process may involve, among other things, successfully completing clinical trials. If we are required to conduct premarket
	clinical trials, whether using prospectively acquired samples or archival samples, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly increase our development costs, delay introduction of any future tests and interrupt
	sales of our current tests. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement of clinical
	trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for
	the clinical trial. The process for submitting a 510(k) premarket notification and receiving FDA clearance usually takes from three to 12&nbsp;months, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never guaranteed. The process for submitting
	and obtaining FDA approval of a PMA generally takes from one to three years or even longer and approval is not guaranteed. PMA approval typically requires extensive clinical data and can be significantly longer, more expensive and more uncertain
	than the 510(k) clearance process. Despite the time, effort and expense expended, there can be no assurance that a particular device ultimately will be cleared or approved by the FDA through either the 510(k) clearance process or the PMA process on
	a timely basis, or at all.

	Additionally, the FDA has recently solicited public input and published two draft guidance documents relating
	to FDA oversight of NGS-based tests. The two draft guidance documents on NGS-based tests describe the FDA&#146;s current thinking and proposed approach regarding the possible use of FDA-recognized standards to support analytical validity, and public
	human genetic variant databases to support clinical validity, of these tests. While it appears that the FDA is striving to provide a flexible pathway to device clearance or approval for manufacturers seeking to market NGS-based tests, it is unknown
	how the FDA may regulate such tests in the future and what testing and data may be required to support such clearance or approval. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests and the FDA requires more extensive testing, such as
	clinical trials, for example, we could experience significantly increased development costs and delay.

	Moreover, there can be no

	there is uncertainty about their legal status, if we are required by the FDA to label them as investigational, or if labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are limited, order levels may decline and reimbursement may be adversely affected. As a

	The Affordable Care Act made a number of substantial
	changes to the way healthcare is financed both by governmental and private insurers. For example, the Affordable Care Act requires each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its
	medical devices. The medical device tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled to return beginning in 2018. It is unclear at this time when, or if, the provision of our LDTs will trigger the medical device tax if the FDA ends its
	policy of general enforcement discretion and regulates certain LDTs as medical devices, and it is possible that this tax will apply to some or all of our existing tests or tests we may develop in the future. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act
	establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, to propose reductions to payments in order to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if expenditures exceed certain targets. The expenditure targets for IPAB proposals
	have not been exceeded at this time, and it is unclear when such targets may be exceeded in the future, when any IPAB-proposed reductions to payments could take effect and how any such reductions would affect reimbursement payments for our tests.
	The Affordable Care Act also contains a number of other provisions, including provisions governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement matters and fraud and abuse, which we expect will impact our industry and our
	operations in ways that we cannot currently predict.

	In April 2014, Congress passed PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way
	in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, certain clinical laboratories are required to report to CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for &#147;advanced diagnostic laboratory
	tests&#148;), private payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. We do not believe that our tests meet the current
	definition of advanced diagnostic laboratory tests, and therefore we believe we will be required to report private payor rates for our tests every three years. As required under PAMA, CMS will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to
	develop Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates for the tests. On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements under
	PAMA. The impact of the new payment system on rates for our tests, including any current or future clinical diagnostic laboratory tests or advanced diagnostic laboratory tests we may develop, is not clear at this time.

	We cannot predict whether these or other recently enacted or future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level
	or how any such legislation or regulation may affect us. For instance, the payment reductions imposed by the Affordable Care Act and the changes to reimbursement amounts paid by Medicare for tests such as ours based on the procedure set forth in
	PAMA, as well as the expansion of the federal and state governments&#146; role in the U.S. healthcare industry generally and the social, governmental and other pressures to reduce healthcare costs while expanding individual benefits, could limit the
	prices we will be able to charge or the amount of available reimbursement for our tests, which would reduce our revenue and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

	Our international operations are subject to various anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA. The FCPA prohibits companies and their
	intermediaries from offering, making, or authorizing improper payments to non-U.S. or foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. If we engage independent distributors to sell our
	tests internationally, we will need to exercise a high degree of vigilance in maintaining, implementing and enforcing our policy against participation in corrupt activity, as these distributors could be deemed to be our agents and we could be held
	responsible for their actions. We also may be subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the United Kingdom&#146;s Bribery Act of 2010, which prohibits commercial bribery and the acceptance of bribes, and
	makes it a crime for companies subject to its jurisdiction to fail to prevent bribery. These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature and, as a result, we may be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance
	with these laws or any changes to these laws or their interpretation. We currently engage in some business outside of the United States, and we plan to increase our international operations in the future. These operations could involve dealings with
	governments and state-owned entities, such as government hospitals, outside of the United States. In addition, we may engage third-party intermediaries, such as representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, to promote and sell our products and
	solutions abroad and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with foreign officials, which expose us to risks under the FCPA and other
	anti-corruption laws. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical fields have faced substantial fines and criminal penalties for violating the FCPA. We have instituted policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed
	to promote compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. We could be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees and intermediaries, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such
	activities, and our employees or third-party intermediaries may not comply with our policies, procedures, or applicable anti-corruption laws. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve
	significant management distraction, involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations. We could also incur severe
	penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures, as well as reputational harm.

	Three cases involving diagnostic
	method claims and &#147;gene patents&#148; have recently been decided by the Supreme Court. In March 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in
<I>
	Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories
</I>
	, or Prometheus, a case involving patent claims
	directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a specific patient, holding that the applicable patents&#146; claims failed to incorporate sufficient inventive content above and beyond mere underlying natural correlations to allow the
	claimed processes to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws. In June 2013, the Supreme Court decided
<I>
	Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics
</I>
	, or Myriad, a case challenging the validity of patent claims
	relating to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, holding that isolated genomic DNA that exists in nature, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is not patentable subject matter, but that cDNA, which is an
	artificial construct created from RNA transcripts of genes, may be patent eligible. In June 2014, the Supreme Court decided
<I>
	Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International
</I>
	, or Alice, which affirmed the Prometheus and Myriad decisions
	and provided additional interpretation. Our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and tests may not be negatively impacted by the Prometheus, Myriad and Alice decisions, rulings in other cases or guidance or procedures issued by the

	We cannot fully predict the impact of the Prometheus, Myriad and Alice decisions on the ability of genetic testing,
	biopharmaceutical or other companies to obtain or enforce patents relating to DNA, genes or genomic-related discoveries in the future, as the contours of when claims reciting laws of nature, natural phenomena or abstract ideas may meet patent
	eligibility requirements are not clear and may take years to develop via interpretation at the USPTO and in the courts. There are many previously issued patents claiming nucleic acids and diagnostic methods based on natural correlations that issued
	before these recent Supreme Court decisions and, although many of these patents may be invalid under the standards set forth in these decisions, these patents are presumed valid and enforceable until they are successfully challenged and third
	parties holding these patents could allege that we infringe, or request that we obtain a license under, these patents. Whether based on patents issued prior to or after these Supreme Court decisions, we could be forced to defend against claims of
	patent infringement or obtain license rights, if available, under these patents. In particular, although the Supreme Court has held in Myriad that isolated genomic DNA is not patent-eligible subject matter, third parties could allege that our
	activities infringe other classes of gene-related patent claims. There are numerous risks associated with any patent infringement claim against us, which are discussed above under &#147;&#151;Litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of
	intellectual property infringement or misappropriation could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our tests.&#148;

	In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of significant
	changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include a transition from a &#147;first-to-invent&#148; system to a &#147;first-to-file&#148; system, changes to the way issued patents are challenged and changes to the way patent applications are disputed
	during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed new regulations and procedures to govern the
	full implementation of the America Invents Act, but the impact of the America Invents Act on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend any patents

	liabilities and will incur immediate dilution of $6.94 per share, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. Further, assuming our issuance
	and sale of 4,200,000&nbsp;shares of common stock in this offering at the assumed initial public offering price, investors purchasing common stock in this offering will contribute approximately 59.0% of the total amount invested by stockholders
	since our inception, but will own only approximately&nbsp;24.6% of the shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to this offering. Any exercise of outstanding options would result in further dilution. As of June&nbsp;30, 2016, there
	were outstanding options to acquire up to 4,478,000 common units of Fulgent LLC, which will become options to acquire up to 589,138 shares of our common stock upon completion of the Reorganization. As a result of the dilution to investors purchasing

	Prior
	to April&nbsp;4, 2016, Fulgent LLC conducted the following two lines of business: the business described in this prospectus, which Fulgent LLC conducted directly and which is the only business we are presently pursuing; and the Pharma Business,
	which was conducted through Fulgent LLC&#146;s former subsidiary, Fulgent Pharma LLC, or Fulgent Pharma. Prior to the Pharma Split-Off, all of Fulgent LLC&#146;s authorized, issued and outstanding equity interests were separated into two series
	based on these two lines of business, such that holders of Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class D-1 preferred units and Class D voting and non-voting common units had economic rights based on the assets, income, earnings and profits and any liabilities,
	expenses, costs and charges of the business described in this prospectus, and holders of Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class P preferred units and Class P voting and non-voting common units had economic rights based on the assets, income, earnings and profits
	and any liabilities, expenses, costs and charges of the Pharma Business. On April&nbsp;4, 2016, Fulgent LLC completed the Pharma Split-Off to separate the Pharma Business from the business described in this prospectus. To effect the Pharma
	Split-Off, Fulgent LLC redeemed each member&#146;s Class P preferred and common units, distributed to each such member substantially identical units of Fulgent Pharma and caused Fulgent Pharma to assume all then-outstanding options to acquire Class
	P common units.

	Since completion of the Pharma Split-Off, (i)&nbsp;Fulgent LLC has not pursued any aspect of the Pharma Business and its
	entire operations have been focused on the business described in this prospectus, (ii)&nbsp;Fulgent Pharma is no longer Fulgent LLC&#146;s subsidiary, Fulgent LLC does not own any securities of Fulgent Pharma and, except as described below and
	elsewhere in this prospectus, neither Fulgent LLC nor Fulgent Inc. is associated with Fulgent Pharma, and (iii)&nbsp;Fulgent LLC has no Class P preferred or common units authorized, issued or outstanding and all of Fulgent LLC&#146;s authorized,
	issued and outstanding equity interests consist of Class D common units, two classes of preferred units convertible into Class D common units and options to acquire Class D common units. As used in this prospectus, unless the context otherwise
	requires, the term &#147;common units&#148; refers to Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class D voting and non-voting common units and the term &#147;units&#148; refers to Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class D common units and preferred units convertible into Class D voting
	common units.

	nominee of Fulgent Inc., is an equity holder of Fulgent&nbsp;Pharma. In Mr.&nbsp;Hsieh&#146;s capacity as the Manager of Fulgent Pharma, Mr.&nbsp;Hsieh retains full authority, power and discretion to manage and control the business and affairs of
	Fulgent Pharma. He has delegated certain day-to-day oversight responsibility to subordinates, but remains active in significant decisions and policy making.

	are a type of equity award containing a participation threshold (which we sometimes refer to as a profits interest threshold) that entitles the recipient of the award to participate in the value of Fulgent LLC only to the extent it appreciates from
	and after the grant date of the award. Pursuant to the determination of the Manager of Fulgent LLC, the participation thresholds applicable to all Class D common units that constitute profits interests (i)&nbsp;will be ignored and not applied in
	calculating the number of shares of our common stock to be issued in exchange for such units in the Reorganization and (ii)&nbsp;will not carry over to such shares. As a result, the holders of Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class D common units that constitute
	profits interests will receive shares of our common stock in the Reorganization at the same ratio as the holders of Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class D common units that are not subject to profits interest thresholds. Ignoring all profits interest thresholds
	upon the conversion of the Class&nbsp;D common units that constitute profits interests into shares of our common stock at the effective time of the Reorganization will result in an equity-based compensation expense that we will record during the

	Overview

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a rapidly growing technology company with an initial focus on offering comprehensive genetic testing to provide physicians with
	clinically actionable diagnostic information they can use to improve the overall quality of patient care. We have developed a proprietary technology platform that integrates sophisticated data comparison and suppression algorithms, adaptive learning
	software, advanced genetic diagnostics tools and integrated laboratory processes. This platform allows us to offer a broad and flexible test menu while maintaining accessible pricing, high accuracy and competitive turnaround times. We believe our
	current test menu offers more genes for testing than our competitors in today&#146;s market, which enables us to provide expansive options for test customization and clinically actionable results. We have generated growing demand for our tests with
	relatively little marketing efforts to date, which we believe demonstrates the advantages of our offering compared to other available testing alternatives.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After launching our first commercial genetic tests focused on rare pediatric diseases in 2013, our tests covered more than 1,000 genes in 100
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	pre-established,
</FONT>
	multi-gene, disease-specific panels by the first quarter of 2014 and more than 10,000 genes in over 170&nbsp;panels by the end of 2015. Today, we have further expanded our test menu to offer more
	than 18,000 single-gene tests and more than 200 panels that collectively test for more than 7,500 genetic conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. We offer tests at competitive prices, averaging
	approximately $1,400 per billable test delivered in the six months ended June 30, 2016, and with competitive turnaround times. Our volume has grown rapidly since our commercial launch, with over 13,000 billable tests delivered to over 600 total
	customers as of June&nbsp;30, 2016. We delivered 6,852 billable tests in 2015 compared to 966 billable tests delivered in 2014, and we delivered 5,209 billable tests in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2,762 billable tests delivered in
	the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015. We have experienced compound quarterly growth of 19.5% in the number of billable tests delivered from the first quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. Further, approximately 86% of our test
	billings which were generated and due in 2015 were paid during that period. We recorded revenue and net loss of $9.6 million and $8.3 million in 2015, respectively, and revenue and net loss of $7.4 million and $5.1&nbsp;million in the six months
	ended June 30, 2016, respectively.

	Our

	tests they order. In addition, we are seeking to grow our customer base by continuing to acquire new hospital and medical institution customers and expand into additional customer groups, such as individual physicians and other practitioners, as
	well as research institutions. For example, in 2016, we have contracted with a regional physician services organization based in Southern California and a national health insurance company to become an in-network provider and we have enrolled as a
	supplier in the Medicare program and nine state Medicaid programs. We have also established a vendor code with, and started to receive orders from, a national clinical laboratory that orders our tests to fulfill some of the genetic testing orders it
	receives from certain U.S. government agencies. Although establishing these relationships does not obligate this laboratory or any physicians to order our tests at any agreed volume or frequency or at all, we believe our ability to establish these
	types of relationships and relationships with other new customers and achieve increased sales to existing customers are significant indicators of the potential for growth of our business.

	our competitors, totaling approximately $521 per billable test delivered in the six months ended June 30, 2016. This low cost per billable test allows us to maintain affordable pricing for our customers, averaging approximately $1,400 per billable
	test delivered in the six months ended June 30, 2016, which we believe encourages repeat ordering from existing customers and attracts new customers. We believe this low internal cost is a key contributor to our ability to grow our business and

	oncology, cardiology, pediatrics and prenatal test panels, which represent large genetic testing markets in which we believe our comprehensive and flexible tests will be competitive. We also believe there is a large potential for growth of genetic
	testing in many international markets due to the presence of high unmet diagnostic and predictive testing needs, rapidly rising healthcare expenditures and patient awareness of next generation sequencing technologies. We plan to engage distributors
	or establish other types of arrangements, such as joint ventures, in an effort to expand our presence and test volume in new geographic markets. We believe expanding our test menu and our geographic presence will appeal to a broader base of

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In today&#146;s market, third-party payors generally restrict the reimbursement of genetic testing to a limited subset of genetic tests and
	only for those patients that meet specific criteria. This lack of widespread favorable reimbursement policies has presented a challenge for genetic testing companies in building sustainable business models. As part of our strategy for growth, we
	intend to pursue coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at a level adequate for us to achieve profitability with this payor group. To this end and as described above, in 2016, we have contracted with a regional physician services
	organization and a national health insurance company to become an in-network provider and enrolled as a supplier with Medicare and nine state Medicaid programs, which means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at
	negotiated rates. Although this does not guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels, we believe our low cost per billable test will enhance our ability to compete effectively in the
	third-party payor market and our flexibility in establishing additional relationships with third-party payors. Our level of success in obtaining and maintaining adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for our testing services
	will, we believe, be a key factor in the rate of growth of our business over the long term.

	In May 2016, Fulgent&nbsp;LLC completed a transaction with Xi Long USA, Inc., or Xi Long, an independent investor, and certain members of
	Fulgent&nbsp;LLC. In this transaction, (i)&nbsp;Xi Long acquired 4,618,421 Class D-1 preferred units and 5,644,737 Class D common units from certain existing members of Fulgent LLC for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $12.0&nbsp;million,
	which units were required to be redeemed by Fulgent&nbsp;LLC in exchange for its issuance to Xi Long of an equivalent number of Class D-2 preferred units, and (ii)&nbsp;Fulgent&nbsp;LLC sold an additional 5,131,579 Class D-2 preferred units to Xi
	Long for gross proceeds of approximately $15.2 million. Fulgent LLC incurred issuance costs of $185,000 for the transaction, resulting in net proceeds to Fulgent LLC of approximately $15.0 million. As a result of the transaction, Xi Long acquired an
	aggregate of 15,394,737 Class D-2 preferred units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $27.2&nbsp;million, even though, at issuance, the fair value of 15,394,737 Class D-2 preferred units as evidenced by Fulgent LLC&#146;s then most
	recent third-party valuation was approximately $32.6 million. The $5.5 million difference between the fair value of, and the aggregate consideration paid by Xi Long for, the Class D-2 preferred units issued in the transaction was not attributable to
	any stated rights or privileges. Rather Fulgent LLC, Xi Long and the members of Fulgent LLC that were party to the transaction determined to complete the transaction in line with their discussions, notwithstanding that the fair value of the Class

	Prior to April&nbsp;4, 2016, Fulgent LLC conducted the following two lines of business: the business described in this prospectus, which
	Fulgent LLC conducted directly and which is the only business we are presently pursuing; and our former pharmaceutical business, or the Pharma Business, which was conducted through Fulgent LLC&#146;s former subsidiary, Fulgent Pharma LLC, or Fulgent
	Pharma. Prior to April 4, 2016, all of Fulgent LLC&#146;s authorized, issued and outstanding equity interests were separated into two series based on these two lines of business, such that holders of Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class D-1 preferred units and
	Class D voting and non-voting common units had economic rights based on the assets, income, earnings and profits and any liabilities, expenses, costs and charges of the business described in this prospectus, and holders of Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class P
	preferred units and Class P voting and non-voting common units had economic rights based on the assets, income, earnings and profits and any liabilities, expenses, costs and charges of the Pharma Business. On April&nbsp;4, 2016, Fulgent LLC
	separated the Pharma Business from the business described in this prospectus in a transaction we refer to as the &#147;Pharma Split-Off.&#148; To effect the Pharma Split-Off, Fulgent LLC redeemed each member&#146;s Class P preferred and common

	authorized, issued and outstanding equity interests consist of Class D common units, two classes of preferred units convertible into Class D common units and options to acquire Class D common units. As used in this discussion and analysis, unless
	the context otherwise requires, the term &#147;common units&#148; refers to Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class D voting and non-voting common units and the term &#147;units&#148; refers to Fulgent LLC&#146;s Class D common units and preferred units

	benefit costs, bonuses and equity-based compensation expenses; costs of laboratory supplies; depreciation of laboratory equipment; amortization of leasehold improvements and allocated overhead, including rent and utilities. Costs associated with
	performing tests are recorded as tests are processed. We expect cost of revenue to generally increase as we increase the number of tests we deliver.

	Revenue increased $3.6 million, or 97%, from the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015 to the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016, primarily due
	to the increased number of billable tests delivered. The number of billable tests delivered increased from 2,762 in the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015 to 5,209 in the same period in 2016. The increase in number of billable tests delivered that
	positively impacted our revenue between periods was primarily attributable to the expansion of our test menu, including single-gene tests and multi-gene panels, and an increase in sales to our existing customers, combined with growth in the genetic
	testing market and increased physician awareness and acceptance of genetic tests. The average price of the billable tests we delivered remained relatively consistent between periods. Revenue from international customers accounted for 49% and 44% of
	total revenue in the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

	Cost of revenue increased $1.3 million, or 91%, from the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015 to the six&nbsp;months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016.
	The increase was primarily attributable to increases of $463,000 in personnel costs related to increased headcount and $372,000 in reagents and supplies expenses. Our gross profit increased $2.4 million between periods, primarily due to increased
	revenue, and our cost of revenue as a percent of revenue, or gross margin, increased from 62% to 63% between periods, primarily due to lower costs per billable test resulting from economies of scale.

	Revenue increased $8.3 million, or 649%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the increased number of billable tests delivered. The
	number of billable tests delivered increased from 966 in 2014 to 6,852 in 2015. The increase in number of billable tests delivered that positively impacted our revenue was primarily attributable to the expansion of our test menu, including
	single-gene tests and multi-gene panels, and an increase in sales to our existing customers, combined with growth in the genetic testing market and increased physician awareness and acceptance of genetic tests. The average price of the billable
	tests we delivered increased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014. Revenue from international customers accounted for 50% and 47% of total revenue in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

	Cost of revenue increased $4.1 million, or 442%, from 2014 to 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases of $1.7 million in equity-based
	compensation expense, which relates to grants of fully vested equity awards in 2015, $1.2 million in reagents and supplies expenses, $687,000 in personnel costs related to increased headcount and $233,000 in depreciation of laboratory equipment. Our
	gross profit increased $4.2 million between periods, primarily due to increased revenue, and our gross margin increased from 27% to 47% between periods primarily due to lower costs per billable test resulting from economies of scale.

	Our quarterly operating results were materially affected by the inclusion of $8.2&nbsp;million and
	$1.6&nbsp;million of equity-based compensation expense in the quarters ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and March&nbsp;31, 2016, respectively, and $5.5 million of other expense in the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2016 related to the difference between
	the fair value and the effective issuance price of the Class D-2 preferred units we issued in the Xi Long financing. Cost of revenue increases were directly related to the increase in the number of billable tests delivered during each of the
	quarters through June&nbsp;30, 2016, as well as the effect of equity-based compensation expenses in the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Operating expenses, other than equity-based compensation expenses, generally increased consistently with
	the growth of the business. Our expenditures in research and development, other than equity-based compensation expenses, were higher in the quarters ended March&nbsp;31, 2016 and June&nbsp;30, 2016

	Since
	inception, our operations have been financed primarily by our founder and Manager, Ming Hsieh, and, in recent periods, by cash from our operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and June&nbsp;30, 2016, we had $0.5 million and $16.1 million of cash,
	respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May 2016, we closed the Xi Long financing for net proceeds to us of approximately $15.0&nbsp;million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our primary uses of cash are to fund our operations as we continue to grow and invest in our business. Cash used to fund operating expenses is
	impacted by the timing of our payment of expenses, as reflected in the changes in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our cash as of June&nbsp;30, 2016 was $16.1 million, which includes $4.6 million that was distributed to Mr.&nbsp;Hsieh as a return of capital
	contribution on September 20, 2016. We believe that our existing cash, along with cash from our operations and estimated net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next
	12&nbsp;months. Much of the losses we incurred during the quarters ended December 31, 2015, March 31, 2016 and June&nbsp;30, 2016 are attributable to non-cash charges for equity-based compensation expense associated with grants of awards of fully
	vested equity during certain of these periods and for other expense associated with the difference between the fair value and the effective issuance price of the units we issued to Xi Long in May 2016. Thus, in spite of the losses we recorded, cash
	provided by operating activities has been positive since 2015 and has significantly contributed to our ability to meet our liquidity needs during these periods, including our ability to pay capital expenditures. Additionally, if our business
	continues to grow as we anticipate and we are able to achieve increased efficiencies and economies of scale in line with this growth, we expect that increased revenue will increase our ability to rely on cash from our operations to support our
	business in future periods, even if our expenses also increase as a result of the growth of our business. As a result, we anticipate that cash from our operations will play a meaningful role in our ability to meet our liquidity requirements and
	pursue our business plan and strategies, both in the 12-month period following this offering and in the longer term.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However, our
	expectations regarding the cash to be provided by our operations and our cash needs in future periods could be wrong, in which case we may require additional financing to support our operations, as we do not presently have any commitments for future
	capital. Further, even if our liquidity expectations are correct, we may seek to raise additional capital through securities offerings, credit facilities or other debt financings, asset sales or collaborations or licensing arrangements. Additional
	funding may not be available to us when needed, on acceptable terms or at all. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders, including investors purchasing common stock in this offering, could experience substantial dilution.
	Additionally, any preferred equity securities we issue could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock and our issuance of any additional equity securities, or the possibility of such an issuance, could cause
	the market price of our common stock to decline. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings, if available, could impose significant restrictions on our operations, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue
	additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, and would result in increased fixed payment
	obligations. In the event that we seek to sell assets or enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms or relinquish or license to a third party our rights to important or
	valuable technologies or tests we may otherwise seek to develop

	ourselves. Moreover, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs.
	If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed and on reasonable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs, sales and marketing initiatives or other growth plans or
	strategies. In addition, we may be forced to work with a partner on one or more aspects of our tests or market development programs, which could lower the economic value of these tests or programs to our company. Any such outcome could significantly

	Cash provided by operating activities in the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016 was $2.4 million. The difference between net loss and cash
	provided by operating activities for the period was primarily due to the effect of $5.5 million of non-cash charges related to the difference between the fair value and the effective issuance price of the units we issued to Xi Long, which was
	recorded as other expense, and $1.6&nbsp;million of non-cash equity-based compensation charges associated with a fully-vested equity award granted in January 2016. Cash provided by operating activities increased between periods primarily due to a
	$0.6 million increase in accounts payable, which resulted from increased revenue and purchases, offset by the negative effect of a $0.6&nbsp;million increase in accounts receivable from increased revenue. Cash provided by operating activities in the
	six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015 was $0.6 million. The difference between net loss and cash provided by operating activities for the period was primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in accounts payable, which resulted from increased revenue

	This management&#146;s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on Fulgent LLC&#146;s
	consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
	estimates. These estimates are based on historical data and experience, as well as various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
	value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances.

	We account for equity-based compensation arrangements with our employees, consultants and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-employee
</FONT>
	directors using a fair value method, which requires us to recognize compensation expense for costs related to all equity-based payments. To date, our equity-based awards have included fully vested equity awards, including common units subject to
	profits interest thresholds (which we sometimes refer to in this discussion and analysis as &#147;profits interests&#148;) and grants of options subject to time-based vesting and exercisability restrictions until a liquidity event or incorporation
	of Fulgent LLC, each as defined in the equity incentive plan under which the awards were granted. An incorporation will be deemed to have occurred upon completion of the Reorganization, at which time the options will become immediately exercisable,
	to the extent vested. The fair value method requires us to estimate the fair value of equity-based awards to employees and non-employees on the date of grant, and we have utilized the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to make this estimation. The
	fair value is then recognized as equity-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period, of the award. For fully vested equity awards, the entire fair value is recognized as equity-based
	compensation expense in the period the award is granted. Equity-based awards granted to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting term.

	As provided in the Practice Aid, there are several
	approaches for allocating enterprise value of a privately held company among the securities held in a complex capital structure. The possible methodologies include the probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM, the option-pricing method,
	or OPM, the current-value method or a hybrid of the PWERM and the OPM, which is referred to as the hybrid method. Under the PWERM, equity is valued based upon the probability-weighted present value of expected future returns, considering various
	future outcomes available to us, as well as the rights of each class of equity. The OPM treats common equity and preferred equity as call options on the enterprise&#146;s value. The exercise prices associated with these call options vary according
	to the liquidation preference of the preferred equity, the preferred equity conversion price, the exercise prices of common equity options and other features of a company&#146;s equity capital structure. The current-value method, which is generally
	only used for early stage companies, is based on first determining enterprise value using a market, income or asset-based approach, and then allocating that value to the preferred equity based on its liquidation preference or conversion value,
	whichever would be greater.

	We are a rapidly
	growing technology company with an initial focus on offering comprehensive genetic testing to provide physicians with clinically actionable diagnostic information they can use to improve the overall quality of patient care. We have developed a
	proprietary technology platform that integrates sophisticated data comparison and suppression algorithms, adaptive learning software, advanced genetic diagnostics tools and integrated laboratory processes. This platform allows us to offer a broad
	and flexible test menu while maintaining accessible pricing, high accuracy and competitive turnaround times. Combining next generation sequencing with our technology platform, we can perform full-gene sequencing with deletion/duplication analysis in
	single-gene tests, pre-established, multi-gene, disease-specific panels and customized panels that can be tailored to meet specific customer needs. We believe our current test menu offers more genes for testing than our competitors in today&#146;s
	market, which enables us to provide expansive options for test customization and clinically actionable results. After launching our first commercial genetic tests focused on rare pediatric diseases in 2013, our tests covered more than 1,000 genes in
	100 panels by the first quarter of 2014 and more than 10,000 genes in over 170 panels by the end of 2015. Today, we have further expanded our test menu to offer more than 18,000 single-gene tests and more than 200 panels that collectively test for
	more than 7,500 genetic conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders.

	Genetic testing has
	experienced significant growth in recent years. As this trend continues, we believe genetic testing will become a more accepted part of standard medical care and the knowledge of a person&#146;s unique genetic makeup will begin to play a more
	important role in the practice of medicine. Genetic testing offers the possibility of early identification of a disease or a genetic predisposition to a disease. As a result, we believe widespread genetic testing could enable significant health
	improvements and healthcare cost reductions. Furthermore, we believe genetic testing and existing and future diagnostics tools will facilitate production of more comprehensive information that physicians can use to enhance disease prognosis and
	prediction, as well as for pharmacogenomic purposes. According to GrandView Research, the size of the global NGS genetic testing market, which includes presequencing, sequencing and data analysis, is estimated to be approximately $4.0&nbsp;billion
	in 2016, including approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion in the United States, and is expected to reach approximately $10.5&nbsp;billion by 2022, including approximately $3.6&nbsp;billion in the United States.

	While adoption of genetic testing has increased in recent years, we believe widespread utilization has been limited because many tests are
	prohibitively expensive, are produced through inefficient processes and often do not result in clinically actionable data. Through our technology, we have developed genetic tests designed to address these limitations and provide a robust platform
	for future growth. The key features of our technology platform include: proprietary gene probes we develop and manufacture that are engineered to interact with our software; data comparison algorithms that allow for the efficient comparison of DNA
	sequences to publicly available databases and our proprietary reference library of genetic information; data suppression algorithms that reduce irrelevant noise in the genetic data we collect; internally developed adaptive learning software
	supporting our reporting systems; and integrated laboratory information management systems that allow us to efficiently manage workflow, monitor quality and ensure the fidelity of information generation and analytics for reporting. This technology
	platform allows us to deliver comprehensive, adaptable, clinically actionable and affordable genetic analysis while maintaining a low cost per billable test, enabling us to efficiently meet customer needs with the latest genes, panels and custom
	offerings. We believe our technology platform provides a sustainable competitive advantage in genetic testing today and as we implement new diagnostic tools in the future.

	Genetic testing identifies mutations in genes or chromosomal abnormalities to confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or to
	evaluate a person&#146;s likelihood of developing a genetic condition. For example, a person displaying symptoms of one or more conditions could use genetic testing to determine or confirm a diagnosis, which can be especially useful for conditions
	that are difficult to diagnose. Further, a person with a family history of a particular condition, such as breast cancer, could use genetic testing to predict the likelihood of developing the condition. For instance, a mutation in the BRCA1 gene
	indicates an estimated 84% cumulative risk of developing breast cancer by age 70. The results of genetic testing can also be used to improve the selection and implementation of drug treatment programs targeting specific diseases.

	The process
	for conducting a genetic test begins with the extraction of genomic DNA from a tissue specimen collected and provided by an ordering physician. The extracted DNA is then sequenced using various equipment and other tools depending on the nature of
	the test. For instance, tests relying upon next generation sequencing technology use NGS sequencers and associated reagents to sequence DNA. Additionally, gene probes are an important tool used in the sequencing process. A gene probe is a single
	strand of DNA that has a base sequence complementary to the base sequence of a targeted gene. During the sequencing process, gene probes are introduced and will bind to the complementary base sequence, identifying the presence and location of the
	gene. After the DNA is sequenced using all appropriate equipment and tools, the fully sequenced genes are analyzed in a process known as curation, in which every DNA sequence is aligned with a known reference sequence and differences between the DNA
	sequence and the reference sequence are identified. These differences, which represent potential genomic alterations, are then compared to publicly available sources and proprietary genetic libraries to identify pathogenic alterations associated
	with disease or disease risk. The data produced by this sequencing and analysis is then synthesized into a report that is delivered to the ordering physician.

	The genetic testing market is characterized by several testing methods based on different techniques, including microarray-based tests and NGS
	tests. Microarray-based tests are used to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously. Although microarray technologies are older than NGS technologies, the market for these tests continues to be significant, totaling
	approximately $960&nbsp;million, or 15.4% of the overall market, in 2014, according to GrandView Research. NGS technology, a relatively new genetic testing technique, has dramatically improved genetic testing by enabling millions of DNA fragments to
	be sequenced in parallel. As the cost of NGS testing continues to decline and the performance of NGS testing continues to improve, the availability and demand for genetic tests is expected to continue to accelerate. Furthermore, with the innovations
	in genomic medicine in recent years and the expected further advances in this area in the near term, pharmacogenomics, the practice of selecting and implementing drug treatment programs based on genetic information, is expected to continue to grow.

	The scientific curation of individual genetic disorders, genes and variants is relatively new and rapidly evolving. Although
	genetic tests are available to assist in the diagnosis or treatment planning of thousands of disorders, the implications of gene mutations are subject to substantial uncertainty due to a number of factors. Genetic curation has historically been done

	literature that does not have standard nomenclature or expression, is subject to individual interpretation of data from genetic analyses and literature and often includes outdated, incomplete or otherwise flawed information. As a result, functional

	All genetic testing providers use gene probes in the sequencing process to

	Broad and flexible test menu.

	We offer single-gene tests on over 18,000 genes, which, to our knowledge, is thousands more than any of our competitors&#146; portfolios. We believe the breadth of genes in our
	portfolio allows us to provide more comprehensive genetic information and improves our variant detection rate, which can increase the clinical actionability of the data we produce. The breadth of genes in our portfolio also allows us to provide a
	flexible and customizable test menu for our customers that can reduce sequential retesting. We offer single-gene tests on all of the genes in our portfolio, as well as deletion/duplication analysis and site-specific tests. If customers desire a
	broader test, we offer more than 200 pre-established, multi-gene panels that focus on various genetic conditions. These panels can be adjusted up or down to include more or fewer genes, or customers can design their own panels to their exact
	specifications. We also offer clinical and full gene exome testing options. We offer our tests at different price points and turnaround times depending on the size and complexity of the test, which increases optionality for our customers. We believe
	the flexibility of our offering improves the efficiency and utility of the data output by our tests and decreases overall customer costs. We also offer our customers access to our highly qualified genetic counselors and laboratory experts to assist
	in interpreting the data we provide, which further increases the utility of our test results for ordering physicians.

	Expansive and growing genetic library.

	Using our proprietary gene probes and testing processes, we are able to capture large amounts of genetic information on each test we perform&#151;oftentimes more than is
	ordered for the test&#151;without an incremental increase in our costs. Through this data collection process, we have developed a proprietary reference library of expansive genetic information. This reference library is automatically curated by our
	adaptive learning software and supplemented with manual curation by our team of highly trained professionals, which adds to and improves upon the information available in public genetic databases. This software allows us to leverage publicly

	The benefit of including multiple genes on a single panel was recently discussed in a study published by the
	USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center in
<I>
	Cancer Genetics
</I>
	. The study retrospectively evaluated 475 individuals with a personal or family history of cancer who had undergone a clinically indicated multi-gene panel test of six to 110 genes from
	one of the following six commercial laboratories: Myriad Genetics (n&#061;354), Ambry Genetics (n&#061;100), Fulgent (n&#061;17), University of Washington Genetics Laboratory (n&#061;2), City of Hope Molecular Diagnostics (n&#061;1) and Baylor
	Genetics Laboratory (n&#061;1). The study concluded that multi-gene panel testing increases the yield of mutations detected and adds to the capability of providing individualized cancer risk assessment. More specifically, the study reported that
	deleterious mutations were identified in 15.6% of patients tested on a variety of multi-gene panels, which included 8.6% of patients who would not have a mutation detected if a targeted gene-by-gene-approach had been used. The study also presented
	evidence that, as the number of genes on a panel increased, a higher proportion of panels identified a mutation. The Fulgent panels evaluated in the study contained over 100 genes compared to less than 30 genes in the next largest panel.
	Additionally, approximately 35% of our panels identified a genetic mutation, and in comparison, the test with the next highest percentage of detected mutations identified mutations in approximately 17% of its tests.

	Grow our customer base.

	Our existing customer base consists primarily of hospitals and medical institutions, which are frequent and high-volume users of genetic tests. We believe we must expand our customer base
	laterally and vertically to achieve our desired growth. We are seeking to grow our customer base laterally by continuing to acquire new hospital and medical institution customers and expand into additional customer groups, such as individual
	physicians and other practitioners, as well as research institutions. To achieve this lateral customer growth, we plan to continue to increase our direct sales force and to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, including continued efforts to
	obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our tests. For example, in 2016, we have contracted with a regional physician services organization based in Southern California and a national health insurance company to become an in-network provider
	and we have enrolled as a supplier in the Medicare program and nine state Medicaid programs. We have also established a vendor code with, and started to receive orders from, a national clinical laboratory that orders our tests to fulfill some of the
	genetic testing orders it receives from certain U.S. government agencies, and we expect to pursue other similar relationships in the future, where clinical, reference or other CLIA-certified laboratories order our tests and use the results to
	complete some of the genetic testing orders they receive. Our vertical customer growth strategy focuses on more deeply penetrating our relationships with existing customers to increase the volume of tests they order. We plan to achieve this vertical
	customer growth by continuing to broaden our test menu and by educating the medical community about the benefits of our genetic tests and genetic testing in general.

	individual customer, even though the unit may represent multiple physicians and healthcare providers ordering tests. We have primarily sold our tests to hospitals, including children&#146;s hospitals, and medical institutions. We have approached the
	genetic testing market with a focus on these customers in part because they are frequent and high-volume users of genetic tests. We believe this customer base provides a meaningful opportunity for further growth by vertically deepening these
	relationships to drive increased ordering. Additionally, collection of billings from these institutional customers is more attainable than other types of customers in today&#146;s reimbursement environment. Approximately 86% of our test billings
	that were generated and due in 2015 were paid during that period. In addition, we believe hospitals and medical institutions are early adopters of NGS technology and could influence broader clinical acceptance of genetic testing as a predictive,
	diagnostic and pharmacogenetics tool due to their influential position in the medical community. As a result, we have pursued and attained as customers many hospitals and medical institutions that we believe are recognized leaders in the medical
	field, including the following representative list of some of our top 50 hospital and medical institution and children&#146;s hospital customers by number of billable tests delivered in the six&nbsp;months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016:

	We intend to continue to expand our reach laterally to include new customer groups, such as individual
	physicians and other practitioners, as well as research institutions, as we increase our focus on our sales and marketing activities, including our efforts to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our tests. For example, in 2016, we have
	contracted with a regional physician services organization based in Southern California and a national health insurance company to become an in-network provider and we have enrolled as a supplier in the Medicare program and nine state Medicaid
	programs. We have also established a vendor code with, and started to receive orders from, a national clinical laboratory that orders our tests to fulfill some of the genetic testing orders it receives from certain U.S. government agencies, and we
	expect to pursue other similar relationships in the future, where clinical, reference or other CLIA-certified laboratories order our tests and use the results to complete some of the genetic testing orders they receive.

	Additionally, the majority of our business to date has been from U.S. customers, with approximately 50%, 53% and 56% of our total revenue
	generated from sales to U.S. customers in 2014, 2015 and the six&nbsp;months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016, respectively. We intend to grow our non-U.S. customer base and the volume of tests ordered from non-U.S. customers in the near-term. We intend to

	Generally, our customers can be divided into three categories based on the party from which we receive payment for our tests: hospitals and
	medical institutions; patients and third-party payors. Hospitals and medical institutions are responsible for paying for the vast majority of the tests we have delivered since our inception. We bill these organizations for our tests and they are
	responsible for paying us directly and either billing their patients separately or obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors in connection with a patient&#146;s diagnosis

	related group. A small percentage of our customers are patients, whose physicians order our tests and the patients elect to pay for the tests themselves with out-of-pocket payments. Third-party
	payors, which consist of private health insurers and CMS, have been responsible for paying for a small number of the tests we have delivered to date; however, as we seek to expand our customer base to include more individual practitioners, we expect
	this category of payors will be responsible for many of the tests we deliver to these customers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Third-party payors require us to
	identify the test for which we are seeking reimbursement using a Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code set maintained by the American Medical Association, or AMA. Where we offer a multi-gene panel and there is no CPT code for the full panel
	but the panel includes a gene for which the AMA has an established CPT code, we identify the test provided under that CPT code when billing a third-party payor for that test. In cases where there is not a specific CPT code, our test may be billed
	under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure. Because this miscellaneous code does not describe a specific service, the insurance claim must be examined to determine what service was provided, whether the service was
	appropriate and medically necessary, and whether payment should be rendered, which may require a letter of medical necessity from the ordering physician. Given the changing CPT coding environment and our development of relationships with third-party
	payors, we expect that our practices regarding billing these payors will evolve in the future.

	We currently operate with a lean sales team consisting of sales and marketing experts who are highly trained and educated about the
	complexities of our tests. Because our sales and marketing personnel serve as a primary interface between our company and many of our customers, we believe the power of this team is directly correlated to its breadth and depth of understanding of
	our technologies, our offering and the advantages of each. As a result, we expect to invest time and capital in aggressively growing our sales force and delivering rigorous training to these personnel. Our sales and marketing team consisted of eight
	individuals as of September&nbsp;1, 2016 and we plan to continue to increase this number. We have experienced our sales to date largely through organic growth of our customer base and in spite of our small marketing presence, which we believe

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our sales and marketing strategy is designed to expand our brand awareness, laterally grow our customer base and vertically penetrate our
	relationships with existing customers by educating the medical community, including existing and potential future customers, about the benefits and the full scale of our offering. Our marketing activities include targeted marketing initiatives, such
	as working with medical professional societies to promote awareness of the benefits of our tests and genetic testing in general, presenting at medical conferences and scientific meetings and pursuing publication in medical and scientific journals.
	In addition, we conduct email advertising campaigns to existing and potential future customers when we want to send a specific message about our company and our brand, including, for instance, when we launch new tests or new test options, such as

	Our sales and marketing strategy is also focused on offering differentiated and highly available customer service resources, which we believe
	is an important factor in maintaining and deepening our customer relationships. Genetic tests are highly complex by nature and we recognize that our customers may want to discuss with us available testing options, specimen collection requirements,
	expected turnaround times, the cost of the test and the clinical reports we produce. As a result, we offer comprehensive customer service designed to enable efficient ordering and increase the accessibility of our clinical reports. We strive to
	answer phone calls directed to our customer service team with a person, not an auto-attendant, and to provide physicians with the answers they need on their first contact with us, including, as needed, access to our licensed and qualified laboratory
	directors who review and approve each report we produce. Additionally, all of the reports we produce are accessible by our customers online via an encrypted web portal, allowing our customers flexibility in viewing their reports and seamless access
	to our customer service resources.

	type of genetic testing we would otherwise perform for them. In this regard, continued development of, and associated decreases in the cost of, equipment, reagents and other materials and databases and genetic data interpretation services may enable
	broader direct participation in genetic testing and analysis and drive down the use of third-party testing companies such as ours. Moreover, the biotechnology and genetic testing fields continue to undergo significant consolidation, permitting

	Pursuant to its authority under the FDC Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things,
	IVDs used for clinical purposes. The tests that we offer are IVDs. The laws and regulations governing the marketing of IVDs are evolving, extremely complex, and in many instances there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of
	these laws and regulations. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices
	in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the import and export of medical devices.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control
	necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a
	previously 510(k) cleared device are categorized as Class III. These devices typically require submission and approval of a PMA. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to
	the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification submission requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit
	to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is &#147;substantially equivalent&#148; to: (i)&nbsp;a device that was legally marketed prior to May&nbsp;28, 1976, for which PMA approval is not required, (ii)&nbsp;a
	legally marketed device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or (iii)&nbsp;another legally marketed, similar device that has been cleared through the 510(k) process.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the Quality System
	Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; the FDA&#146;s general prohibition against promoting
	products for unapproved or &#147;off-label&#148; uses; and the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a
	way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could
	result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA&#146;s refusal to grant future
	premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications, and criminal prosecution.

	Although the FDA
	has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including IVDs, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDC Act and
	regulations with respect to LDTs, which are a subset of IVDs that are intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. We believe our tests fall within the definition of an LDT. As a result, we believe our

	states that the FDA intends to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs in a risk-based manner consistent with the existing classification of medical devices. Thus, the
	FDA plans to begin to enforce its medical device requirements, including premarket submission requirements, for LDTs that have historically been marketed without FDA premarket review and oversight. The FDA states its intention in the Framework
	Guidance to require registration or listing and adverse event reporting six months after the Framework Guidance is finalized and to publish general LDT classification guidance within 24 months of the date on which the Framework Guidance is
	finalized. According to the Framework Guidance, the FDA intends to enforce premarket review requirements in a risk-based, phased-in manner, starting with the highest risk LDTs beginning 12 months after the Framework Guidance is finalized, followed
	by other high risk LDTs in the next four years, and then moderate risk LDTs in the four years after that. Generally, for each category of LDTs, the FDA intends to continue exercising enforcement discretion pending the FDA&#146;s review and
	consideration of the premarket submissions for devices that are already in use at the time&#151;so long as premarket submissions are timely made. However, for certain categories of the highest risk LDTs (specifically, (i)&nbsp;LDTs with the same
	intended use as a cleared or approved companion diagnostic; (ii) LDTs with the same intended use as an FDA-approved Class III medical device; and (iii) certain LDTs for determining the safety or efficacy of blood or blood products), the FDA intends
	to begin enforcing premarket review requirements immediately upon publication of the finalized Framework Guidance for all new LDTs in those categories.

	If and when the Framework Guidance and Notification Guidance are finalized, or if the FDA disagrees with our assessment that our tests fall
	within the definition of an LDT, we could for the first time be subject to enforcement of regulatory requirements such as registration and listing requirements, medical device reporting requirements and quality control requirements. Any new FDA
	enforcement policies affecting LDTs may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our tests and to develop and introduce new tests in the future. Additionally, if and when the FDA begins to actively enforce its
	premarket submission regulations with respect to LDTs generally or our tests in particular, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance for our tests under Section&nbsp;510(k) of the FDC Act or approval of a PMA. The process for submitting a
	510(k) premarket notification and receiving FDA clearance usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never guaranteed. The process for submitting and obtaining FDA approval of a PMA generally takes
	from one to three years or even longer and approval is not guaranteed. PMA approval typically requires extensive clinical data and can be significantly longer, more expensive and more uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. If premarket review
	is required for some or all of our tests, the FDA could require that we stop selling our products pending clearance or approval and conduct clinical testing prior to making submissions to FDA to obtain premarket clearance or approval. The FDA could
	also require that we label our tests as investigational or limit the labeling claims we are permitted to make.

	While there is also the
	risk that the FDA does not consider our tests to be LDTs, the Framework Guidance states that, in the interest of ensuring continuity in the testing market and avoiding disruption of access to tests marketed as LDTs that do not meet the FDA&#146;s
	definition of LDTs, the FDA intends to apply the same risk-based framework described in the Framework Guidance to any IVD that is offered as an LDT by a CLIA-certified laboratory.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, the FDA has recently solicited public input and published two draft guidance documents relating to FDA oversight of NGS-based
	tests. The two draft guidance documents on NGS-based tests describe the FDA&#146;s current thinking and proposed approach regarding the possible use of FDA-recognized standards to support analytical validity, and public human genetic variant
	databases to support clinical validity, of these tests. While it appears that the FDA is striving to provide a flexible pathway to device clearance or approval for manufacturers seeking to market NGS-based tests, it is unknown how the FDA may
	regulate such tests in the future and what testing and data may be required to support such clearance or approval. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests and the FDA requires more extensive testing such as clinical trials, for
	example, we could experience significantly increased development costs and delay.

	to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to certain LDTs is difficult to predict at this time. If the FDA ultimately lifts its policy of enforcement discretion over LDTs and begins to enforce its medical device requirements with
	respect to LDTs, our tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA, the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the FDA or instruction by Congress. Failure to comply
	with any applicable FDA requirements could trigger a range of enforcement actions by the FDA, including warning letters, civil monetary penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure, operating restrictions, partial suspension or

	Third-party payors, including private insurers and CMS, require genetic testing companies to identify each test for which

	appropriate CPT code for any genes in a panel, in which case our test would be billed under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure. Because these miscellaneous codes do not describe a specific service, the insurance claim
	would need to be examined to determine the service that was provided, whether the service was appropriate and medically necessary and whether payment should be rendered. This process can require a letter of medical necessity from the ordering

	In September 2014,
	the AMA published new CPT codes for genomic sequencing procedures that are effective for dates of service on or after January&nbsp;1, 2015. These include genomic sequencing procedure codes for certain multi-gene panel tests. In a final determination
	under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, published in November 2014, CMS set the 2015 payment rate for these codes using the gap-fill process. Under the gap-fill process, local Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs,
	establish rates for the codes that each MAC believes meet the criteria for Medicare coverage and considering laboratory charges and discounts to charges, resources, amounts paid by other payors for the tests and amounts paid by the MAC for similar
	tests. In 2015, gap-filled payment rates were established for some, but not all, of the published codes for genomic sequencing procedures. For the codes for which local gap-filled rates were established in 2015, a national limitation amount for
	Medicare was established for 2016. For the codes for which local gap-filled rates were not established in 2015, associated procedures are priced by the local MACs in 2016 if an individual MAC determines that such codes should be covered. Where
	available, the national limitation amount serves as a cap on the Medicare and Medicaid payment rates for a test procedure, which may not be adequate for all of the procedures covered by the applicable codes, including our tests to the extent we are

	of agency. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly depending on the failure and include civil monetary penalties of up to $1.5 million per violation of the same requirement per calendar year. A
	single breach incident can result in violations of multiple requirements, resulting in potential penalties in excess of $1.5 million. Additionally, a person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation
	of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one year of imprisonment. These criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for

	uncertain, contradictory and in flux. For example, a new GDPR and Cybersecurity Directive have been enacted in the European Union and will come into full effect in May 2018. These texts will introduce many changes to privacy and security in the
	European Union, including stricter rules on consent and security duties for critical industries, including for the health sector. The interpretation of some rules is still unclear, and some requirements may be completed by national legislation. This
	makes it difficult to assess the impact of these new data protection laws on our business at this time. More generally, foreign laws and interpretations governing data privacy and security are constantly evolving and it is possible that laws may be
	interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current practices, in which case we could be subject to government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices. These fines can be very high. For instance, the GDPR

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or
	receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in order to induce or in return for the referral of an individual for the furnishing of or arranging for the furnishing of, purchasing, leasing, ordering or
	arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the
	Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of
	&#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than
	its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, although it does contain several exceptions. HHS has issued a series of regulatory
	&#147;safe harbors,&#148; which set forth certain provisions that, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with the statutory exceptions or
	regulatory safe harbors ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the
	transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Furthermore, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have
	committed a violation. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are severe and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a violation of
	the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can serve as a basis of liability under the federal False Claims Act (described below). Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor,
	including commercial insurers.

	There are also U.S. federal laws related to healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare
	matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines,
	imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false,
	fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or
	specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. A violation of this statute is also a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs.

	The U.S. federal law directed at &#147;self-referrals,&#148; commonly known as the &#147;Stark Law,&#148; prohibits a physician from making
	referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare program, to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a direct or indirect financial relationship, unless an
	exception applies. The prohibition also extends to payment for any services referred in violation of the Stark Law. A physician or entity that engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law&#146;s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000
	for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare program in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per service, an assessment of
	up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that a physician&#146;s financial relationship with a laboratory must meet an
	exception under the Stark Law or the referrals are prohibited. Thus, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute&#146;s safe harbors, if a laboratory&#146;s financial relationship with a referring physician does not meet the requirements of a Stark Law
	exception, then the physician is prohibited from making Medicare and Medicaid referrals to the laboratory and any such referrals will result in overpayments to the laboratory and subject the laboratory to the Stark Law&#146;s penalties.

	Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare referrals. The Stark Law also prohibits state receipt of federal Medicaid
	matching funds for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral, but this provision of the Stark Law has not been implemented by regulations. In addition, some courts have held that the submission of claims to Medicaid that would be
	prohibited as self-referrals under the Stark Law for Medicare could implicate the False Claims Act.

	In March 2010,
	the Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States. The Affordable Care Act made a number of substantial changes to the way healthcare is financed both by governmental and private insurers. For example, the Affordable Care Act requires each

	at this time when, or if, the provision of our LDTs will trigger the medical device tax if the FDA ends its policy of general enforcement discretion and regulates certain LDTs as medical devices, and it is possible that this tax will apply to some
	or all of our existing tests or tests we may develop in the future. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act establishes an IPAB to propose reductions to payments in order to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if expenditures
	exceed certain targets. The expenditure targets for IPAB proposals have not been exceeded at this time, and it is unclear when such targets may be exceeded in the future, when any IPAB-proposed reductions to payments could take effect and how any
	such reductions would affect reimbursement payments for our tests. The Affordable Care Act also contains a number of other provisions, including provisions governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement matters and
	fraud and abuse, which we expect will impact our industry and our operations in ways that we cannot currently predict.

	Our common stock has been approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol &#147;FLGT.&#148; Under the rules of&nbsp;NASDAQ,
	independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company&#146;s board of directors within a specified period of time after the closing of the company&#146;s initial public offering. In addition, the rules of NASDAQ require that, subject to
	specified exceptions, each member of a listed company&#146;s audit, compensation and nominating committees be independent. Audit committee and compensation committee members must also satisfy enhanced independence criteria set forth in Rule
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	regulations of the SEC and the listing requirements and rules of NASDAQ. In making this determination, the current and prior relationships of each non-employee director with our company and all other facts and circumstances deemed relevant were
	considered, including their beneficial ownership of our capital stock before and after completion of this offering. Mr.&nbsp;Hsieh is not independent because he is an employee of our company.

	Chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer is the most effective leadership structure for our company at this time. We believe Mr.&nbsp;Hsieh is the director best situated to identify strategic opportunities and focus the
	activities of the board of directors on the matters most critical to our company&#146;s business and strategy, due to his commitment to our business. The board of directors also believes that the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

	in our company. Upon completion of the Reorganization, any outstanding options, restricted share units and profits interest awards granted under the 2015 Plan will be equitably adjusted and convert into equivalent options to acquire shares of our
	common stock, restricted stock units relating to shares of our common stock and shares of our common stock, respectively. Following completion of the Reorganization, no further awards will be granted under the 2015 Plan and the plan will be
	terminated. The following is a description of the material terms of the 2015 Plan:

	acquire 45,000 common units have been granted and options to acquire 30,000 common units have been forfeited or cancelled, and (ii) restricted share units relating to 500,000 common units have been granted. In connection with this offering, these

	Options represent a right to purchase common units of Fulgent LLC. The term of each option is 10 years from the grant date of the option.
	Restricted share units are notional units that represent an unfunded and unsecured right to receive common units of Fulgent LLC. Profits interest awards are a type of equity award containing a participation threshold that entitles the recipient of
	the award to participate in the value of Fulgent LLC only to the extent it appreciates from and after the grant date of the award. Vesting schedules vary from award to award, but, generally, one-quarter of the common units subject to an option or
	restricted share units vest

	On April&nbsp;4, 2016, we effected the Pharma Split-Off, pursuant to which Fulgent LLC separated the Pharma Business from the business
	described in this prospectus by redeeming each of its member&#146;s Class P preferred and common units, distributing to each such member substantially identical units of Fulgent Pharma and causing Fulgent Pharma to assume all then-outstanding
	options to acquire Class P common units. See &#147;Pharma Split-Off and Reorganization&#148; for additional information. Following the Pharma Split-Off, Mr. Hsieh, the Manager and largest equity holder of Fulgent LLC and President and Chief

	the Pharma Business. On May&nbsp;19, 2016, Fulgent LLC, Fulgent Pharma and Mr.&nbsp;Hsieh entered into a contribution and allocation agreement pursuant to which the parties specified and agreed to the allocation of such capital contributions between
	Fulgent LLC and Fulgent Pharma in the following amounts: $4.6 million was allocated to Fulgent LLC and $10.9 million was allocated to Fulgent Pharma. The agreement also clarified that Mr.&nbsp;Hsieh&#146;s contributions were properly characterized
	as capital contributions, rather than loans to Fulgent LLC and Fulgent Pharma, notwithstanding a series of promissory notes previously entered into by Mr.&nbsp;Hsieh and Fulgent LLC.

	The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements may
	discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if
	successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder&#146;s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these
	indemnification provisions.

	We believe the provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification
	agreements discussed above are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as directors and officers of our company. We also intend to maintain insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act that might be incurred by any director or officer in his or her capacity as such. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors,
	executive officers or persons controlling us, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore, in the opinion of the SEC, unenforceable.

	At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, director nominees or officers as to which
	indemnification is required or permitted and we are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification.

	Prior to completion of this offering, our board of directors plans to adopt a written related person transaction policy to establish policies
	and procedures for the review and approval or ratification of all related person transactions. Effective upon completion of this offering, this policy is expected to provide that our related persons, which consist of our executive officers,
	directors, director nominees, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock and any immediate family member of and any entity affiliated with any of the foregoing persons, are not permitted to enter into a material transaction in which we
	are a participant without the prior review and approval of our audit committee, or a special committee composed solely of disinterested directors in the event it is inappropriate for our audit committee to review the transaction due to a conflict of
	interest, where a &#147;material transaction&#148; constitutes a transaction in which the amount involved exceeds or is expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year. In reviewing, considering and approving or rejecting any such material
	transaction, we expect that our related person transaction policy will require consideration of the facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to our audit committee or special committee, including, among others, whether the transaction
	is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person&#146;s interest in the transaction.

	We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of shares of common stock
	beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock subject to options or other derivative securities held by that person that are currently exercisable or convertible or
	that will become exercisable or convertible within 60&nbsp;days after&nbsp;September 1, 2016, but we did not deem these shares outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. The information in the table below
	is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose and the inclusion of any shares in the table does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership of those shares. Except as otherwise indicated by the footnotes below,
	we believe, based on information furnished to us, that the persons named in the table below have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all shares of our common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community

	Applicable percentage ownership is based on 12,846,256&nbsp;shares of common stock outstanding as of
	September&nbsp;1, 2016, after giving effect to the Reorganization, which will occur immediately prior to completion of this offering. For purposes of the table below, we have assumed that we will issue and sell 4,200,000&nbsp;shares of our common
	stock in this offering. The table below excludes any shares of common stock that may be purchased by our directors, executive officers or existing equity holders in this offering, pursuant to the directed share program or otherwise. Mr.&nbsp;Hsieh,
	our founder and Chief Executive Officer, has indicated an interest in purchasing up to 1,050,000 of the shares of our common stock to be sold in this offering at the initial public offering price and on the same terms as the other purchasers in this

	These provisions are also designed to reduce our vulnerability to hostile takeovers and to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. We believe the benefits of these provisions, including increased protection of our potential

	actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a United States person and the holder either certifies its non-U.S. status, such as by furnishing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, or otherwise establishes an exemption. However,
	information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in connection with any dividends on our common stock paid to the Non-U.S. Holder, regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld. In addition, proceeds of the sale or other taxable
	disposition of our common stock within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting, if the applicable withholding agent receives the certification
	described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States person, or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds of a disposition of our common stock conducted through a non-U.S. office of a

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax
	Compliance Act, or FATCA) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on, or gross proceeds from the sale or other
	disposition of, our common stock paid to a &#147;foreign financial institution&#148; or a &#147;non-financial foreign entity&#148; (each as defined in the Code), unless (i)&nbsp;the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and
	reporting obligations, (ii)&nbsp;the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any &#147;substantial United States owners&#148; (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United
	States owner, or (iii)&nbsp;the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting
	requirements in (i)&nbsp;above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain &#147;specified United States persons&#148; or
	&#147;United States owned foreign entities&#148; (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account
	holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of dividends on
	our common stock, and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common stock on or after January&nbsp;1, 2019.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to
	close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. If the
	underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the

	We conducted

	material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
	designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
	audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the balance sheet, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall balance
	sheet presentation. We believe that our audit of the balance sheet provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the
	standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
	Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
	are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
	on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	The Company is a rapidly growing technology company with an initial focus on offering comprehensive genetic testing to provide physicians with
	clinically actionable diagnostic information they can use to improve the overall quality of patient care (the &#147;Diagnostics business&#148;). The Company has developed a proprietary technology platform that allows it to offer a broad and flexible
	test menu while maintaining accessible pricing, high accuracy and competitive turnaround times. The Company&#146;s current test menu offers single-gene tests and various pre-established, multi-gene, disease-specific panels that collectively test for
	many genetic conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. The Company&#146;s existing customer base consists primarily of hospitals and medical institutions, which are frequent and high-volume users of
	genetic tests.

	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, primarily those related to: (i)&nbsp;revenue recognition criteria,
	(ii)&nbsp;accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts, (iii)&nbsp;the useful lives of fixed assets, (iv)&nbsp;the valuation of common and preferred units and (v)&nbsp;assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
	determine the fair value of options and profits interest awards. These estimates are based on historical data and experience, as well as various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
	form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances. Significant
	estimates relied upon in preparing these consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, the determination of the fair value of equity-based awards, equity-based compensation expense and liabilities.

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The effects of this standard on the

	In February 2016, the FASB
	issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-02,
<I>
	Leases (Topic 842)

	. The new standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases except those with a term of 12 months or less. The liability will be equal to the
	present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability. The standard is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning March&nbsp;30, 2019. Lessees and lessors are required to use a modified retrospective transition
	method for existing leases. Accordingly, they would apply the new accounting model for the earliest year presented in the financial statements. Adoption of the standard will result in a gross up of the Company&#146;s balance sheet for the
	right-of-use asset and the lease liability for operating leases. The effects of this standard on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows are not yet known.

	. The new guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, policy election to account for
	forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that annual period. Early
	adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt and has elected to account for forfeitures as they actually occur. The Company had not issued any options prior to 2015 and thus adoption had no impact prior to that period.

	In the Recapitalization, the holders of Class&nbsp;A units received both Class D
	and Class P preferred units and the holders of Class B units received both Class D and Class P common units. All of the Class D common units issued in the Recapitalization were subject to a profits interest threshold. In evaluating this transaction,
	the Company considered that the number of units and ownership interests held by each equity holder changed and the nature of the units changed from units that track the performance of the Company as a whole to units that track the separate
	businesses. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that the Recapitalization should be accounted for as the extinguishment of Class&nbsp;A and Class B units and the issuance of Class D and Class P preferred and common units, based on the
	Company&#146;s application of the qualitative approach. The Class D and Class P preferred and common units were recorded at their fair value with the difference between the fair value and carrying value of $34,530 being recorded as a deemed
	distribution to Class A and Class B units attributable to the period prior to the issuance of the Class D and Class P units.

	All Class D and Class P units are non-redeemable. Class D units track the relative performance of the
	Diagnostics business and Class P units track the relative performance of the Pharma business, and the distributable amounts, if any, would come from the respective businesses related to those units. After the Recapitalization and until the split-off
	of the Pharma business on April&nbsp;4, 2016, there was no single security that tracked or represented the performance of the Company as a whole. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, 34,000 Class&nbsp;D common units and 6,000 Class P common units were
	subject to profits interest thresholds, which must be met prior to distribution to the holder of such units. These profits interest thresholds are $0.0476 and $0.0287 per unit for the Class D and Class P units, respectively. Pursuant to the
	Operating Agreement in effect subsequent to the Recapitalization, distributions from the Diagnostics business and Pharma business are to be made first pro rata to the members holding Class D and Class P preferred units, respectively, until such
	members have received aggregate distributions equal to the sum of the capital contributions made by such members to the applicable business. The $15,500 capital contributions made by the former Class&nbsp;A member were allocated as follows: $4,600
	and $10,900 to his Class D and Class P preferred units, respectively. Any remaining distributions are then to be made pro rata to all members holding Class D and Class P units in accordance with such members&#146; percentage ownership of all
	outstanding Class D and Class P units, respectively, including those units subject to profits interest thresholds after earnings are in excess of the applicable profits interest threshold amount.

	Determining the fair value of equity-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. The Company&#146;s use of the Black-Scholes
	option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option or other award, risk-free interest rates, assumed dividend yield of the underlying units, expected volatility of the price of the underlying
	units and the fair value of the underlying units. The assumptions used in the Company&#146;s application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model represent management&#146;s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the
	application of management&#146;s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, the Company&#146;s equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.

	All awards of units subject to profits interest thresholds were fully vested as of the grant date and may be
	repurchased in whole or in part by the Company at any time during the nine-month period following the termination of the holder&#146;s continuous service. The Company&#146;s repurchase right terminates if not timely exercised by the Company and upon
	the effective date of a registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The participation threshold for each of the awards granted during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 is $0.0476 per unit and $0.0287
	per unit for the Class D and Class P units, respectively. Of the awards granted during the period, all were granted under the Plan except for an award of 16,000&nbsp;Class D units subject to a profits interest threshold granted to an employee. These
	units are legally outstanding units of the Company that allow the holder to participate in distributions upon exceeding the designated thresholds. These units are accounted for at fair value and are considered equity instruments.

</I>
	. The Company does not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of the price of its common units or the expected term of its options. The Company calculates expected volatility based
	on historical volatility data of a representative group of companies that are publicly traded. The Company selected representative companies with comparable characteristics to it, including risk profiles and position within the industry, and with
	historical equity price information sufficient to meet the expected term of the equity-based awards. The Company computes the historical volatility of this selected group using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; equity during
	the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of its equity-based awards. The Company will continue to use the representative group volatility information until the historical volatility of its equity is relevant to measure expected
	volatility for future option grants.

	As provided in the Practice Aid,
	there are several approaches for allocating enterprise value of a privately held company among the securities held in a complex capital structure. The possible methodologies include the probability-weighted expected return method
	(&#147;PWERM&#148;), the option-pricing method (&#147;OPM&#148;), the current-value method or a hybrid of the PWERM and the OPM, which is referred to as the hybrid method. Under the PWERM, equity is valued based upon the probability-weighted present
	value of expected future returns, considering various future outcomes available to the Company, as well as the rights of each class of equity. The OPM treats common equity and preferred equity as call options on the enterprise&#146;s value. The
	exercise prices associated with these call options vary according to the liquidation preference of the preferred equity, the preferred equity conversion price, the exercise prices of common equity options and other features of a company&#146;s
	equity capital structure. The current-value method, which is generally only used for early stage companies, is based on first determining enterprise value using a market, income or asset-based approach, and then allocating that value to the
	preferred equity based on its liquidation preference or conversion value, whichever would be greater.

	Fulgent Therapeutics LLC was initially formed in June 2011 as a California corporation and converted to a California
	limited liability company in September 2012. The term the &#147;Company&#148; refers to Fulgent Therapeutics LLC and its former subsidiary unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires. The Company&#146;s authorized, issued and
	outstanding equity interests are referred to as &#147;shares&#148; in the Company&#146;s operating agreement, as amended from time to time (the &#147;Operating Agreement&#148;), but are referred to as &#147;units&#148; herein. The Company is managed
	by its Manager, Ming Hsieh, who is also the Company&#146;s controlling equity holder. Dollar and unit amounts, except per unit dollar amounts, are reported in thousands unless otherwise noted.

	The Company is a rapidly growing technology company with an initial focus on offering comprehensive genetic testing to provide physicians with
	clinically actionable diagnostic information they can use to improve the overall quality of patient care (the &#147;Diagnostics business&#148;). The Company has developed a proprietary technology platform that allows it to offer a broad and flexible
	test menu while maintaining accessible pricing, high accuracy and competitive turnaround times. The Company&#146;s current test menu offers single-gene tests and pre-established, multi-gene, disease-specific panels that collectively test for many
	genetic conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. The Company&#146;s existing customer base consists primarily of hospitals and medical institutions, which are frequent and high-volume users of
	genetic tests.

	The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company&#146;s audited consolidated financial statements and notes
	thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015. All intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated balance sheet and statement of members&#146; equity as of June&nbsp;30, 2016,
	and the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual
	financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the Company&#146;s financial position as of June&nbsp;30, 2016 and the results of
	operations and cash flows for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December&nbsp;31,

	In April 2016, the Operating Agreement was amended and restated to provide for the
	distribution of the Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, Fulgent Pharma LLC (&#147;Fulgent Pharma&#148;), in full redemption and cancellation of the Class P preferred and common units. On April&nbsp;4, 2016, the Company completed the split-off of
	Fulgent Pharma and the pharmaceutical business operated by Fulgent Pharma (the &#147;Pharma business&#148;) by redeeming all of the then-outstanding Class P preferred and common units and distributing to each holder of such units substantially
	identical shares of Fulgent Pharma and causing Fulgent Pharma to assume all then-outstanding options to acquire Class P common units that had been issued by the Company. All Class P preferred and common units were immediately cancelled upon
	redemption. The split-off of the Pharma business was a pro-rata distribution to all of the holders of Class P preferred and common units, but did not involve the holders of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;D units. The Manager and controlling
	unitholder of the Company is also the Manager and controlling unitholder of Fulgent Pharma. Therefore, the Company concluded that the transaction should be accounted for as a common control transaction and the recorded amount of Fulgent
	Pharma&#146;s net assets was transferred to the holders of Class P preferred and common units and no gain or loss was recorded.

	Unaudited pro forma basic and diluted loss per share was computed as the income (loss) from continuing operations available to common
	unitholders, described in Note&nbsp;3 to these financial statements, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding, giving effect to the conversion of all Class&nbsp;D units, at a ratio of 7.6-to-one, into shares of the common stock of Fulgent

	date of issuance, if later. The number of shares used in determining unaudited pro forma basic and diluted loss per share also gives effect to the issuance of 459&nbsp;shares in the Offering as if such shares had been issued as of January 1, 2016,
	since the Company did not record earnings during the previous twelve months and, as a result, the proceeds from the issuance of such shares are assumed for purposes of this calculation to be used to pay a distribution of $4,592 to Mr. Hsieh as a
	return of capital contribution, which distribution is expected to be paid from existing cash prior to completion of the Offering.

	On April 4, 2016, the Company completed the split-off of the Pharma business. The financial results of the

	The Company&#146;s common and preferred units have the right to participate in earnings and distributions of the Company but are not obligated
	to fund losses. As a result, in periods of net loss, the Company allocated losses to the holders of its common units subject to profits interest thresholds, as they were determined to be the most subordinate unit. No income has been allocated to
	common units subject to profits interest thresholds, as the distribution thresholds on such units have not been met as of June&nbsp;30, 2016.

	Recapitalization, distributions from the Diagnostics business and Pharma business are to be made first pro rata to the members holding Class D and Class P preferred units, respectively, until such members have received aggregate distributions equal
	to the sum of the capital contributions made by such members to the applicable business. The $15,500 capital contributions made by the former Class&nbsp;A member were allocated as follows: $4,600 and $10,900 to his Class D and Class P preferred
	units, respectively. Any remaining distributions are then to be made pro rata to all members holding Class D and Class P units in accordance with such members&#146; percentage ownership of all outstanding Class D and Class P units, respectively,
	including those units subject to profits interest thresholds after earnings are in excess of the applicable profits interest threshold amount. No cash distributions had been made as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	In April 2014 the Operating Agreement was amended and restated to provide for the distribution of the Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary,
	Fulgent Pharma, in full redemption and cancellation of the Class P preferred and common units. In addition, the Class D preferred units were renamed Class D-1 preferred units and were modified to add conversion rights. In evaluating the change in
	Class D preferred units, the Company considered that the number of units and ownership interests held by each unitholder was unchanged, the nature of the units was unchanged and the addition of the conversion feature did not add any substantive
	value to the units, as upon conversion any preferences in distribution would be relinquished. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that the change in Class D preferred units to Class D-1 preferred units should be accounted for as a
	modification, based on the Company&#146;s application of the qualitative approach. No change in fair value occurred as a result of the modification.

	In May 2016, the Company completed a transaction with Xi Long USA, Inc. (&#147;Xi Long&#148;), an independent investor, and certain members of
	the Company. In this transaction, (i)&nbsp;Xi Long acquired 4,618
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	Class&nbsp;D-1
</FONT>
	preferred units and 5,645 Class D common units from certain existing members of the Company for an aggregate purchase price of
	$11,977, which units were required to be redeemed by the Company in exchange for its issuance to Xi Long of an equivalent number of Class D-2 preferred units, and (ii)&nbsp;the Company sold an additional 5,132 Class D-2 preferred units to Xi Long
	for gross proceeds of $15,188. The Company incurred issuance costs of $185 for the transaction, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $15,003. The Company immediately cancelled the redeemed Class D common and Class D-1 preferred units upon
	completion of the transaction. The Company accounted for this transaction as: (i)&nbsp;the retirement of the redeemed Class D common units, (ii)&nbsp;the extinguishment of the redeemed Class D-1 preferred units, with the excess of the consideration
	transferred over the related carrying amount recorded as a deemed dividend in the amount of $3,727, and (iii)&nbsp;the issuance of 15,395 Class D-2 preferred units for $32,637. As a result of the transaction, Xi Long acquired an aggregate of 15,395
	Class D-2 preferred units for an aggregate purchase price of $27,165, even though, at issuance, the fair value of 15,395 Class D-2 preferred units as evidenced by the Company&#146;s then most recent third-party valuation was $32,637. The $5,472
	difference between the fair value of, and the aggregate consideration paid by Xi Long for, the Class D-2 preferred units issued in the transaction was not attributable to any stated rights or privileges. Rather, the Company, Xi Long and the members
	of the Company that were party to the transaction determined to complete the transaction in line with their discussions, notwithstanding that the fair value of the Class D-2 preferred units as evidenced by the Company&#146;s third-party valuation
	had increased from the time these discussions were initiated to the time the transaction was completed. The $5,472 difference was determined to be a cost of completing the transaction with Xi Long and was recorded as an expense in the accompanying
	condensed consolidated statement of operations.

	Compensation expense related to employee equity-based awards is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of

	Equity-based awards issued to non-employees are accounted for at fair value

	Determining the fair value of equity-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. The Company&#146;s use of the Black-Scholes
	option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option or other award, risk-free interest rates, assumed dividend yield of the underlying units, expected volatility of the price of the underlying
	units and the fair value of the underlying units. The assumptions used in the Company&#146;s application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model represent management&#146;s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the
	application of management&#146;s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, the Company&#146;s equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.

	. The Company does not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of the price of its common units or the expected term of its options. The Company calculates expected volatility based

	historical equity price information sufficient to meet the expected term of the equity-based awards. The Company computes the historical volatility of this selected group using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; equity during
	the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of its equity-based awards. The Company will continue to use the representative group volatility information until the historical volatility of its equity is relevant to measure expected
	volatility for future option grants.

	The Company is a privately held company with no active public market for its common units. Therefore, in determining the fair
	value of equity-based awards, the Manager considered valuations prepared by an independent third party. For the valuation of Class D units related to awards of Class D units and options to acquire Class D units granted in the six months ended June
	30, 2016, the Company incorporated the probability-weighted expected return method (&#147;PWERM&#148;) and utilized the market approach (Precedent Transactions Method) incorporating the Xi Long financing (see Note&nbsp;6), applying a 20% discount
	for lack of marketability. Under the PWERM, the value of common equity is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the enterprise assuming various scenarios. A company&#146;s enterprise value is estimated at the date of various assumed
	potential future outcomes. Each enterprise value is allocated among the different classes of equity based on the rights and characteristics of each class. The resultant equity value is based upon the probability-weighted present value of expected
	future investment returns.

	We have entered or will enter into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors, director nominees named in this

	action or proceeding arising out of his or her service to us or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which the individual provides services at our request. Subject to certain limitations, these indemnification agreements

	The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements may
	discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if

	discussed above are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as directors and officers of our company. We also intend to maintain insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities arising
	under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that might be incurred by any director or officer in his or her capacity as such. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, executive officers or persons controlling us, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and
