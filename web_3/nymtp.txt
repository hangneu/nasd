</P>
<P>
The Issuing Entity is filing this Form 10-K/A to replace Exhibits 31, 33(b) and
34(b) to the original Form 10-K filed on March 28, 2007 and the amended Form
10-K filed on April 20, 2007. American Security Insurance Company, Standard
Guaranty Insurance Company and TrackSure Insurance Agency, Inc. (formerly,
&quot;Safeco Financial Institution Solutions, Inc.&quot;) (&quot;Assurant Inc.&quot;) recently
provided the Issuing Entity with a revised report on assessment of compliance
with servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and a related attestation.
In the original assessment previously provided to the Issuing Entity, Assurant
Inc. excluded Item 1122(d)(4)(xii) from the scope of its assessment. Assurant
Inc. recently provided the Issuing Entity with a revised assessment of
compliance that assesses Assurant Inc.'s compliance with Item 1122(d)(4)(xii)
and identifies material instance of non compliance with this criterion. This
material instance of non compliance is noted in this Form 10-K/A under
&quot;Additional Disclosure Items for Regulation AB.&quot; The Issuing Entity has included
this revised assessment of compliance under Exhibit 33(b), the related
attestation under Exhibit 34(b) and a revised Rule 13a-14(d)/15d-14(d)
Certification under Exhibit 31. This Form 10-K/A does not otherwise amend the
original Form 10-K filed on March 28, 2007 and the amended Form 10-K filed on
April 20, 2007.

Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The servicing criteria have been completed within the manner stated
in the governing documents and are attached hereto under Item 15.
</P>
<P>
Assurant, Inc. previously excluded the applicable servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122 (d)(4)(xii) from the scope of its assessment
of compliance. Assurant, Inc. has now assessed its compliance with
the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period of
January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 and has identified a
material instance of noncompliance with that servicing criterion.
Specifically, Assurant, Inc. did not have, during the Reporting
Period, sufficient policies and procedures to capture the
information with respect to the Platform Transactions necessary to
determine compliance with Item 1122(d)(4)(xii). Accordingly,
Assurant, Inc. has restated its previous assessment for the
Reporting Period, which excluded evaluation of the criterion, to
include the criterion and reflect the material noncompliance as a
result of its assessment.
</P>
<P>
The 1122 statements for Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(Corporate Trust Services) has disclosed material noncompliance with
criterion 1122(d)(3)(i), as applicable to the Company during the
twelve months ended December 31, 2006.  Certain monthly investor or
remittance reports included errors in the calculation and/or the
reporting of delinquencies for the pool assets.
</P>
<P>
The 1122 statements for First American Real Estate Solutions of
Texas, L.P. (as Sub-Contractor for Cenlar, FSB) has disclosed the
following material instance of noncompliance with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(vii)(B) of Regulation AB
applicable to the Company during year ended December 31, 2006.
Account reconciliations for all asset-backed securities related bank
accounts were not prepared within 30 calendar days after the bank
statement cutoff date, or such other number of days specified in the
transaction agreements as required by Item 1122(d)(2)(vii)(B) of
Regulation AB.
</P>
<P>
Although each servicing criterion required by Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB is addressed in one or more of the Assessments of
Compliance with Servicing Criteria and related Attestation Reports
included with this report, the Servicers', ABN AMRO Mortgage Group
Inc ,and Cenlar FSB, Assessments of Compliance and related
Attestation Reports did not address each of the servicing criteria
that the Servicers were required to address under the terms of the
related Servicing Agreements. The Servicers have not identified such
failure to provide an Assessment and Attestation for these items as
a material failure to fulfill its obligations under the related
servicing agreements in the Servicer's Compliance Statements
provided under Item 1123 of Regulation AB, because the Servicers
assert that those items are not applicable to the Servicers.

Mortgage Company, LLC.
</P>
<P>
I, Georganna C. Pate, First Vice President, Loan Administration, of ABN AMRO
Mortgage Group, Inc., certify as follows:
</P>
<P>
1.   ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc. (the &quot;Servicer&quot;) is responsible for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph (d)
of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, as set forth in Exhibit A hereto, in
connection with the servicing of individual residential mortgage-backed
transactions subsequent to January 1, 2006, where the Servicer has been
appointed servicer and where the pool assets for such transactions are
serviced by the Servicer on its Fidelity loan servicing system (the
&quot;Platform&quot;) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006;
</P>
<P>
2.   The Servicer has engaged certain vendors (the &quot;Vendors&quot;) to perform
specific, limited or scripted activities as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2006. As set forth in Exhibit A hereto, the Servicer's
management has determined that these Vendors are not considered a
&quot;servicer&quot; as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Servicer's
management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with
the servicing criteria applicable to each Vendor as permitted by
Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of
Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations (Interpretation 17.06). As
permitted by Interpretation 17.06, management has asserted that it has
policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance
that the Vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to each Vendor. The Servicer's management is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to
apply Interpretation 17.06 for the Vendors and related criteria;
</P>
<P>
3.   Except as set forth in paragraph 4 below, the Servicer used the criteria
set forth in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB to assess the
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2006;
</P>
<P>
4.   The criteria listed as Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Exhibit A hereto
are inapplicable to the Servicer based on the activities it performs with
respect to individual residential mortgage-backed transactions involving
the Platform;
</P>
<P>
5.   For purposes of this certification, the following terms used in Exhibit A
hereto shall have the following meanings:
</P>
<P>
(i)  Regarding 1122(d)(2)(iii), &quot;related accounts&quot; means one or more
custodial accounts maintained pursuant to the agreement or agreements
to which Servicer is a party; and &quot;transaction agreements&quot; means the
agreement or agreements to which Servicer is a party.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
(ii) Regarding 1122(d)(3)(i) through (iv), &quot;Reports to investors&quot;;
&quot;investor reports&quot; and &quot;reports&quot; each mean, where used, reports
Servicer delivers to Purchaser or its agent, such as a master
servicer; &quot;investor&quot; and &quot;investors&quot; each mean, where used, Purchaser
or Purchaser's agent, such as a master servicer; and &quot;transaction
agreements&quot; means, where used, agreements to which Servicer is a
party.
</P>
<P>
(iii) Regarding 1122(d)(3)(i) (C) and (D), Servicer has no knowledge of,
and is not responsible for, Commission filings, or books and records
of others, such as trustees, investors or master servicers.
</P>
<P>
6.   The Servicer has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable
servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006;
</P>
<P>
7.   The Servicer has not identified and is not aware of any material instance
of noncompliance by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2006;
</P>
<P>
8.   The Servicer has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and
procedures to monitor the compliance by the Vendors with the applicable
servicing criteria for the year ended December 31, 2006; and
</P>
<P>
9.   Ernst &amp; Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm has issued an
attestation report on the Servicer's assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,

American Security Insurance Company, Standard Guaranty Insurance Company and
TrackSure Insurance Agency, Inc. (formerly, &quot;Safeco Financial Institution
Solutions, Inc.&quot;) (collectively, the &quot;Asserting Party&quot;) is responsible for
assessing compliance as of December 31, 2006 and for the period of January 1,
2006 through December 31, 2006 (the &quot;Reporting Period&quot;) with the servicing
criteria set forth in Section 1122(d)(2)(vi), Section 1122(d)(4)(xi) and
<BR>
Section 1122(d)(4)(xii) of Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal
Regulations, (the &quot;Applicable Servicing Criteria&quot;) which the Asserting Party
has concluded are applicable to the insurance escrow servicing activities it
performs with respect to all mortgage loan-tracking transactions for such
asset-backed securities transactions that were registered after January 1,
2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities
Act of 1933 (the &quot;Platform Transactions&quot;).
</P>
<P>
The Asserting Party previously excluded the applicable servicing criteria set
forth in Section 1122 (d)(4)(xii) from the scope of its assessment of
compliance. The Asserting Party has now assessed its compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period and has identified a
material instance of noncompliance with that servicing criterion. Specifically,
the Asserting Party did not have, during the Reporting Period, sufficient
policies and procedures to capture the information with respect to the Platform
Transactions necessary to determine compliance with Section 1122(d)(4)(xii).
Accordingly, the Asserting Party has restated its previous assessment for the
Reporting Period, which excluded evaluation of the criterion, to include the
criterion and reflect the material noncompliance as a result of its assessment.
</P>
<P>
The Asserting Party has concluded that, with the exception of the
aforementioned material noncompliance, the Asserting Party has complied, in
all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the
Reporting Period with respect to the Platform Transactions taken as a whole.
The Asserting Party used the criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of Item 1122
of Regulation AB to assess the compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria.

Management Assessment
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Management of Cenlar FSB (the Company) is responsible for assessing compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission for residential mortgage loans (the
Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii) Backup Servicer;
1122(d)(4)(xv) External Enhancement and 1122(d)(4)(i&amp;ii) Maintenance of Mortgage
Documents, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006. These criteria are
not applicable to the Company because the Company does not perform activities
with respect to the Platform relating to these criteria. With respect to
servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), management has engaged
various vendors to perform some of the activities required by this servicing
criteria. The Company's management has determined that these vendors are not
considered a &quot;servicer&quot; as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company's management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by
Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of
Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations (&quot;Interpretation 17.06&quot;). As
permitted by Interpretation 17.06, management has asserted that it has policies
and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company's management is solely responsible for
determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for
the vendors and related criteria. Appendix A identifies the individual
asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting
the Platform.
</P>
<P>
The Company's management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB.
</P>
<P>
Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2006, Cenlar FSB has complied in all material respects with the
servicing criteria, except for the servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii) Backup
Servicer; 1122(d)(4)(xv) External Enhancement and 1122(d)(4)(i&amp;ii) Maintenance
of Mortgage Documents, set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the
Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform.

annexed hereto entitled &quot;1122 Servicing Criteria to be Addressed in Assessment

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the
&quot;Company&quot;) provides this assessment of compliance with the following applicable
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the
servicing criteria are applicable in regards to the servicing platform for the
period as follows:
</P>
<P>
Platform: Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other
asset-backed securities, for which the Company provides master servicing,
trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, excluding
transactions issued by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or
any government sponsored entity (the &quot;Platform&quot;).
</P>
<P>
Applicable Servicing Criteria: All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d),
to the extent required in the related transaction agreements or required by the
Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the
Company, except for the following criteria: 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x),
1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which management has
determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with
respect to the Platform (the &quot;Applicable Servicing Criteria&quot;).
</P>
<P>
Period: Twelve months ended December 31, 2006 (the &quot;Period&quot;).
</P>
<P>
Third parties classified as vendors: With respect to servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged various vendors to handle certain Uniform
Commercial Code filing functions required by the servicing criteria (&quot;vendors&quot;).
The Company has determined that none of the vendors is a &quot;servicer&quot; as defined
in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company elects to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations
(&quot;Interpretation 17.06&quot;). The Company has policies and procedures in place to
provide reasonable assurance that each vendor's activities comply in all
material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The
Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements
to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the Platform and the Period, the Company provides the following
assessment of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:
</P>
<P>
1. The Company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria.
</P>
<P>
2. The Company has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria,
including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on
Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for the Period. In performing
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.
</P>
<P>
3. Other than as identified on Schedule A hereto, as of and for the Period, the
Company was in material compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Any
material instances of noncompliance by a vendor of which the Company is aware
and any material deficiency in the Company's policies and procedures to monitor
vendors' compliance that the Company has identified is specified on Schedule A
hereto.
</P>
<P>
KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
report with respect to the Company's foregoing assessment of compliance as of
and for the Period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Management
Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that ABN AMRO
Mortgage Group, Inc. (&quot;AAMG&quot; or &quot;the Company&quot;), a wholly owned subsidiary of
LaSalle Bank Midwest National Association, complied with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Regulation AB for individual residential mortgage-backed transactions subsequent
to January 1, 2006 where AAMG has been appointed servicer and where the pool
assets for such transactions, serviced by AAMG, reside on its Fidelity loan
servicing system (&quot;the Platform&quot;) as of and for the year ended December 31,
2006, except for those criteria which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the Platform
covered by this report. See Appendix A of management's assertion for a list of
servicing criteria determined by the Company to be applicable to the activities
performed by them with respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for
the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance with
the servicing criteria based on our examination.
</P>
<P>
Our examination was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining,
on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than
all of the individual mortgage transactions that comprise the platform, testing
of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and
determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria.
Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this
report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have
occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions.
We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006
for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

We have examined American Security Insurance Company, Standard Guaranty
Insurance Company and TrackSure Insurance Agency, Inc. (formerly, &quot;Safeco
Financial Institution Solutions, Inc.&quot;)'s (affiliates of Assurant Inc.,
collectively, the &quot;Asserting Party&quot;) compliance with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Regulation AB for all the mortgage loan-tracking transactions for such
asset-backed securities transactions that were registered after January 1,
2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities
Act of 1933 (the &quot;Platform&quot;) described in the accompanying &quot;Restated Report on
Assessment of Compliance with 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(xi) and
1122(d)(4)(xii) of Regulation AB Servicing Criteria&quot;, as of December 31, 2006
and for the year then ended (the &quot;Reporting Period&quot;), excluding criteria
1122(d)(1)(i)-(iv), 1122(d)(2)(i)-(v), 1122(d)(2)(vii), 1122(d)(3)(i)-(iv),
1122(d)(4)(i)-(x) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii)-(xv), which the Asserting Party has
determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by it with
respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for compliance with the
servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Management's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.
</P>
<P>
Our examination was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Asserting Party's compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the
Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform,
and determining whether the Asserting Party processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Asserting Party during
the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect
noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or
subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts
calculated or reported by the Asserting Party during the period covered by
this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Asserting Party's compliance with the servicing criteria.
</P>
<P>
The Asserting Party previously excluded the applicable servicing criteria set
forth in 1122(d)(4)(xii) from the scope of its assessment of compliance. The
Asserting Party has now assessed its compliance with the servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(xii) for the Reporting Period and has identified material
noncompliance with that servicing criterion. Our examination also disclosed
material noncompliance
</P>
<P>
1
</P>
<P>
with the servicing criterion. Specifically, the Asserting Party did not have,
during the reporting period, sufficient policies and procedures to capture the
information with respect to the Platform necessary to determine whether any
late payment penalties in connection with any payment to be made on behalf of
an obligor are paid from the servicer's funds and are not charged to the
obligor, unless the late payment was due to the obligor's error or omission.
The Asserting Party has restated its previous assessment for the Reporting
Period, which excluded evaluation of the criterion, to include the criterion
and reflect the material noncompliance as a result of its assessment.
Accordingly, our present opinion on the Asserting Party's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria, as presented herein, is different from that
expressed in our previous report.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the
preceding paragraph, the Asserting Party complied with the aforementioned
applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006
for the Platform, in all material respects.

<P>
The Board of Directors
<BR>
Cenlar FSB:
</P>
<P>
We have examined management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Assessment, that Cenlar FSB (the Company) complied with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Regulation AB for residential mortgage loans (the Platform), except for
servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii) Backup Servicer; 1122(d)(4)(xv) External
Enhancement and 1122(d)(4)(i&amp;ii) Maintenance of Mortgage Documents, as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2006. These criteria are not applicable to the
Company because the Company does not perform activities with respect to the
Platform relating to these criteria. Appendix A to Management's Assessment
identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by
management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the
Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assessment about the Company's compliance
based on our examination.
</P>
<P>
Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those
selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with
the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether
errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may
have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any
other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.
</P>
<P>
As described in the accompanying Management Assessment, for servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged various vendors to
perform some of the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company
has determined that these vendors are not considered a &quot;servicer&quot; as defined in
Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable
to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations
(&quot;Interpretation 17.06&quot;). As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, the Company has
asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is
solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply
Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi)
and 1122(d)(2)(vi) for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation
17.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 is
fairly stated, in all material respects.

To the Board of Directors of The First American Corporation:
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
We have examined First American Real Estate Solutions of Texas, L.P.'s (the
&quot;Company&quot; and an indirect subsidiary of The First American Corporation),
compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for all loans for residential
mortgage loan outsourcing customers for which the Company served as the
residential tax service provider (the &quot;Platform&quot;) described in the accompanying
Report on Assessment of Compliance, as of December 31, 2006 and for the year
then ended, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(i)-(iii), 1122(d)(2)(i)-(iv),
1122(d)(3)(i)-(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(x) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv)-(xv), which the
Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed
by it with respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company's
compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our
examination.
</P>
<P>
Our examination was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining,
on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected
securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities
related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those
selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected

covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance
arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests
that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does
not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing
criteria.
</P>
<P>
Our examination disclosed the following material instance of noncompliance with
the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(vii)(B) of Regulation AB
applicable to the Company during year ended December 31, 2006. Account
reconciliations for all asset-backed securities related bank accounts were not
prepared within 30 calendar days after the bank statement cutoff date, or such
other number of days specified in the transaction agreements as required by Item
1122(d)(2)(vii)(B) of Regulation AB.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, except for the material instance of noncompliance described in
the preceding paragraph, First American Real Estate Solutions of Texas, L.P.
complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2006 for all loans for residential mortgage loan
outsourcing customers for which the Company served as the residential tax
service provider, in all material respects.

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying
Management's Assertion on Compliance with Item 1122 Criteria, that LaSalle Bank
National Association (&quot;LBNA&quot; or &quot;the Company&quot;), a wholly owned subsidiary of
LaSalle Bank Corporation, complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for all new
Asset Backed Securities, Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities and Residential
Mortgage Backed Securities securitization trust transactions subsequent to
January 1, 2006, to the extent subject to Regulation AB for which LBNA is
trustee (&quot;the Platform&quot;), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006, except
for those criteria which the Company has determined are not applicable to the
activities performed by them with respect to the Platform covered by this
report. See Exhibit A of management's assertion for a list of servicing criteria
determined by the Company to be applicable to the activities performed by them
with respect to the Platform. As indicated in the Management's Assertion on
Compliance with Item 1122 Criteria, management's assertion for servicing
criteria 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) and (B) covers only the information in reports to
investors that is specifically required by the respective transaction
agreements, and not to any additional information included in reports to
investors that is not required by the respective transaction agreements.
Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing
criteria listed in Exhibit A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion about the Company's compliance with the servicing
criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining,
on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006
for the Platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:
</P>
<P>
We have examined the compliance of the Corporate Trust Services division of
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company) with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation
AB for publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other
asset-backed securities, for which the Company provides master servicing,
trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, excluding
transactions issued by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or
any government sponsored entity (the Platform), except for servicing criteria
1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Management is responsible for the
Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance
based on our examination.
</P>
<P>
Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those
selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with
the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether
errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may
have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any
other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.
</P>
<P>
As described in the accompanying management's Assessment of Compliance With
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered a &quot;servicer&quot; as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations (&quot;Interpretation 17.06&quot;). As permitted by
Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and

of KPMG International, a Swiss cooperation.

</P>
<P>
procedures in place designed to provide assurance that the vendors' activities
comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each
vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria
as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to
the Company's eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06.
</P>
<P>
Our examination disclosed material noncompliance with criterion 1122(d)(3)(i),
as applicable to the Company during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.
Certain monthly investor or remittance reports included errors in the
calculation and/or the reporting of delinquencies for the pool assets.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, except for the material non-compliance described above, the
Company complied, in all material respects, with the aforementioned servicing
criteria, including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based
on Interpretation 17.06 as discussed above, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2006.

1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Management is responsible for the
Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance
based on our examination.
</P>
<P>
Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that
comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those
selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with
the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected
transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether
errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may
have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any
other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.
</P>
<P>
As described in the accompanying management's Assessment of Compliance With
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company
has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered a &quot;servicer&quot; as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations (&quot;Interpretation 17.06&quot;). As permitted by
Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and

of KPMG International, a Swiss cooperation.

</P>
<P>
procedures in place designed to provide assurance that the vendors' activities
comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each
vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria
as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to
the Company's eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06.
</P>
<P>
Our examination disclosed material noncompliance with criterion 1122(d)(3)(i),
as applicable to the Company during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.
Certain monthly investor or remittance reports included errors in the
calculation and/or the reporting of delinquencies for the pool assets.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, except for the material non-compliance described above, the
Company complied, in all material respects, with the aforementioned servicing
criteria, including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based
on Interpretation 17.06 as discussed above, as of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2006.
