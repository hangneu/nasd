</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Registrant, Webster City Federal Bancorp (the &quot;Company&quot;), and its
subsidiaries, Webster City Federal Savings Bank and Security Title and Abstract,
Inc., conduct operations in Webster City, Iowa. Webster City Federal Bancorp is
the successor to Webster City Federal Savings Bank, a federal stock savings bank
(the &quot;Bank&quot;), which reorganized into the holding company structure effective
July 1, 1999 (the &quot;Holding Company Reorganization&quot;). In the Holding Company
Reorganization, each outstanding share of the Bank's common stock was converted
by operation of law into one share of the Registrant's common stock, and each
stockholder of the Bank received the same ownership interest in the Registrant
immediately following the Holding Company Reorganization as he or she had in the
Bank immediately prior to that transaction. Webster City Federal Savings Bank
conducts its operations from a single office in Webster City, Iowa, and is the
successor to Webster City Federal Savings and Loan Association, which was
chartered originally in 1934, and became a federally chartered savings and loan
association that same year. The Bank's deposits are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (&quot;FDIC&quot;) under the Savings Association Insurance
Fund (&quot;SAIF&quot;). The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&quot;FHLB&quot;)
System since 1934. Security Title and Abstract, Inc., an Iowa corporation, is
engaged in the business of providing abstracting and title services for
properties located in Hamilton County, Iowa. The Company purchased the
abstracting company in September of 2000. At December 31, 2003, the Company had
total assets of $104.7 million, total deposits of $70.9 million, and
stockholders' equity of $22.7 million.
</P>
<P>
The Company is primarily engaged in the business of attracting deposits
from the general public in the Company's market area and investing such
deposits, together with other sources of funds, in mortgage loans secured by
one- to four-family residential real estate for retention in the Company's
portfolio. At December 31, 2003, $57.5 million, or 83.3% of the Company's net
loan portfolio, consisted of one-to four-family residential mortgage loans and
$5.7 million, or 8.3%, of the Company's net loan portfolio consisted of
multi-family residential, commercial real estate and other loans. The Company
also originates home equity loans, which totaled $4.0 million, or 5.8% of the
Company's net loan portfolio at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003,
consumer and other loans totaled $2.8 million, or 4.1%, of the Company's net
loan portfolio. The Company also invests in mortgage-backed securities issued or
guaranteed by the United States Government or agencies thereof, which totaled
$1.6 million, or 1.5%, of total assets at December 31, 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Company's principal executive office is located at 820 Des Moines
Street, Webster City, Iowa, and its telephone number at that address is (515)
832-3071.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Market Area and Competition
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company is headquartered in Webster City, Iowa, a community of
approximately 8,000 people. The Company is the largest independent financial
institution and the leading originator of home mortgage loans headquartered in
Hamilton County. Although the Company conducts its operations from a single
office, its market area for lending and other financial services consists of
Hamilton and surrounding contiguous counties. Although the economy of the
Company's market area is heavily influenced by agriculture, it has a fairly
diverse industrial base. The major employers in the Company's market are
Frigidaire, a home appliance manufacturer, Van Diest Supply Co., a chemical and
fertilizer concern, Webster City Custom Meats, a meat processor, Tasler Inc., a
pallet/Styrofoam packaging manufacturer, Arrow Acme Corporation, a die-castings
manufacturer, Beam Industries, a central vacuum systems manufacturer, and Daily
Freeman Journal, a newspaper and printing firm.
</P>
<P>
The Company encounters strong competition both in attracting deposits and
in originating real estate and other loans. Its most direct competition for
deposits has historically come from commercial banks, other savings
associations, and credit unions. Competition for loans comes from such financial
institutions as well as mortgage banking companies. The Company expects
continued strong competition in the foreseeable future, including increased
competition from &quot;super-regional&quot; banks entering the market by purchasing large
banks and savings banks. Many such institutions have greater financial and
marketing resources available to them than does the Company. The Company
competes for savings

<P>
deposits by offering depositors a high level of personal service and a wide
range of competitively priced financial services. In recent years, additional
strong competition has come from stock and bond dealers and brokers. The Company
competes for real estate loans primarily through the interest rates and loan
fees it charges and advertising.
</P>
<P>
Finally, competition is likely to increase as a result of the enactment of
the Gramm-Leach-Biley Act of 1999, which eases restrictions on entry into the
financial services market by insurance companies and securities firms. Moreover,
to the extent that these changes permit banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to affiliate, the financial services industry could experience further
consolidation. This could result in a growing number of larger financial
institutions competing in the Company's primary market area that offer a wide
variety of financial services than the Company currently offers. Competition for
deposits, for the origination of loans and the provision of other financial
services may limit the Company's growth and adversely impact its profitability
in the future. The Company competes for savings deposits by offering depositors
a high level of personal service and a wide range of competitively priced
deposit products. The Company competes for loans primarily through the interest
rate and fees it charges and through advertising.

<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Lending Activities
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Loan and Mortgage-Backed Securities Portfolio Composition. The principal
components of the Company's loan portfolio are fixed- and adjustable-rate first
mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, home
equity loans, multi-family residential mortgage loans, and, to a much lesser
extent, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans. At December 31, 2003,
the Company's net loans receivable totaled $69.0 million, of which $57.5
million, or 83.3%, were one- to four-family residential real estate mortgage
loans, $5.7million, or 8.3%, were multi-family residential, commercial real
estate and other loans, $4.0 million, or 5.8%, were home equity loans and $2.8
million, or 4.1%, were consumer and other loans.
</P>
<P>
The Company also invests in mortgage-backed securities consisting of
pass-through certificates insured or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (&quot;FHLMC&quot;), the Government National Mortgage Association
(&quot;GNMA&quot;), or the Federal National Mortgage Association (&quot;FNMA&quot;). At December 31,
2003, mortgage-backed securities totaled $1.6 million, or 1.5% of total assets.
At December 31, 2003, 59.5% of the Company's mortgage-backed securities were
secured by ARM loans, and 40.5% were secured by fixed-rate loans. The Company's
policy is to hold mortgage-backed securities to maturity.

Loan and Mortgage-Backed Securities Maturity Schedule. The following table
sets forth the maturity or period of repricing of the Company's loan and
mortgage-backed securities portfolio at December 31, 2003. Demand loans, loans
having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts
are reported as due in one year or less. Adjustable and floating rate loans are
included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust
rather than in which they contractually mature, and fixed rate loans and
mortgage-backed securities are included in the period in which the final
contractual repayment is due.

One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Loans. The Company's primary
lending activity currently consists of the origination of fixed rate and
adjustable-rate, one-to-four family owner-occupied residential mortgage loans
collateralized by properties located in the Company's market area. The Company
also originates one- to four-family construction loans that convert to permanent
loans after the initial construction period which generally does not exceed nine
months. The Company is a portfolio lender. In recent years, it has not sold
loans in the secondary mortgage market and does not intend to conduct secondary
market sales in the foreseeable future. One- to four-family loans are
underwritten and originated according to policies approved by the Board of
Directors. The Company has purchased one- to four-family mortgage loans
collateralized by properties in Texas and Colorado. At December 31, 2003, the
Company had an aggregate principal balance of $2.3 million in purchased loans.
</P>
<P>
The Company currently offers fixed rate one- to four-family residential
mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years. One- to four-family residential
real estate loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods
than their contractual terms because borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at
their option. The average length of time that the Company's one- to four-family
residential mortgage loans remain outstanding varies significantly depending
upon trends in market interest rates and other factors. In recent years, the
average maturity of the Company's mortgage loans has decreased significantly due
to unprecedented volume of refinancing activity. Accordingly, estimates of the
average

<A NAME="eolPage6"></A>
<P>
length of one- to four-family loans that remain outstanding cannot be made with
any degree of certainty. Originations of fixed rate mortgage loans are monitored
on an ongoing basis and are affected significantly by the level of market
interest rates, the Company's interest rate gap position, and loan products
offered by the Company's competitors. The Company's fixed rate mortgage loans
amortize on a monthly basis, with principal and interest due each month.
</P>
<P>
The Company also originates adjustable-rate mortgage (&quot;ARM&quot;) loans with a
maximum term of up to 30 years. The Company's ARM loans have interest rates that
adjust every year or every three years based on an interest rate index. The
Company's one-year ARM loans have terms of up to 30 years, with interest rates
that adjust annually based on changes in the Quarterly National Average Cost of
Funds for All SAIF Insured Institutions (the &quot;SII Index&quot;). The maximum annual
increase in the interest rate charged on the Company's one-year ARM loans is 100
basis points, and the maximum life of the loan increase in interest rates is 600
basis points. The interest rate on the Company's three-year ARM loans adjusts
every three years by up to 200 basis points per adjustment based on the SII
Index at the time of adjustment. The maximum life of the loan increase in
interest rate on the Company's three-year ARM loans is 600 basis points. In
2003, ARM loan originations decreased as a percentage of total mortgage loan
originations, due to a higher demand for longer term fixed rate loans in the
generally lower market interest rate environment. For the years ended December
31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company originated $1.4 million and $2.8
million of ARM loans, respectively, which represented 10.6% and 16.4% of total
mortgage loan originations, respectively, during such years.
</P>
<P>
The Company's one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans
customarily include due-on-sale clauses, which are provisions giving the Company
the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among
other things, that the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the underlying
real property serving as security for the loan. Due-on-sale clauses are an
important means of adjusting the rates on the Company's fixed rate mortgage loan
portfolio, and the Company has generally exercised its rights under these
clauses.
</P>
<P>
Regulations limit the amount that a savings association may lend relative
to the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan, as determined by an
appraisal at the time of loan origination. Such regulations permit a maximum
loan-to-value ratio of 100% for residential property and 90% for all other real
estate loans. The Company's lending policies limit the maximum loan-to-value
ratio on fixed rate loans without private mortgage insurance to 90% of the
lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property to serve as
collateral for the loan.
</P>
<P>
The Company makes one- to four-family real estate loans with loan-to-value
ratios of up to 95%; however, for one- to four-family real estate loans with
loan-to-value ratios of between 90% and 95%, the Company requires the first 25%
of the loan amount to be covered by private mortgage insurance. The Company
requires fire and casualty insurance, as well as a certificate of title, on all
properties securing real estate loans made by the Company.
</P>
<P>
Low and Moderate Income Loans. The Company participates in low- to
moderate-income home loan programs to qualifying borrowers. One loan program,
which is offered through the Company, enables borrowers to purchase a home with
a minimum 5% downpayment and a 95% loan-to-value ratio. Loans are offered on a
fixed-rate basis with terms of up to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Multi-Family Residential, Commercial Real Estate and Other Real Estate
Loans. At December 31, 2003, the Company had a total of 31 loans secured by
multi-family and commercial real estate properties. The Company's multi-family
real estate loans are secured by multi-family residences, such as rental
properties, and commercial real estate loans are secured by other income
producing properties such as nursing homes and office buildings. The Company
also originates multi-family construction loans that convert to permanent loans
after the initial construction period which generally does not exceed nine
months. At December 31, 2003, the Company's multi-family and commercial real
estate loans had an average principal balance of $131,300, and the largest
multi-family or commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of $776,000.
Multi-family and commercial real estate loans currently are offered with
adjustable interest rates, although in the past the Company has originated
fixed-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans. The terms of each loan
are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, although such loans typically have
adjustable interest rates tied to a market index with a 600 basis point lifetime
interest rate cap, and amortize over 15 years. An origination fee of 1% is
usually charged on multi-family loans. The Company generally makes multi-family
and commercial real estate loans up to 75% of the appraised value of the
property securing the loan.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage7"></A>
<P>
The Company's originations of multi-family and commercial real estate
loans have been limited in recent years because of limited local demand.
However, as noted previously, the Company has in the past purchased
out-of-market loans, and the aggregate principal balance of such multi-family
and commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2003 was $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate generally involve
a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage
loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of
several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of
loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income
producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring
these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by
multi-family and commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the
successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from
the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be
impaired.
</P>
<P>
Home Equity and Home Improvement Loans. The Company also originates home
equity and home improvement loans. As of December 31, 2003, home equity and home
improvement loans totaled $4.5 million, or 6.4%, of the Company's total loan
portfolio. The Company's home equity and home improvement loans have fixed
interest rates and are generally for terms of 5 to 10 years, with a maximum of
15 years. The Company's home equity and home improvement loans are closed-end
loans for specific dollar amounts. They are secured by the borrower's principal
residence with a maximum loan-to-value ratio, including the principal balances
of both the first and second mortgage loans, of 90% or less.
</P>
<P>
Other Consumer Loans. To a much lesser extent, the Company also originates
loans secured by savings deposits, generally with fixed rates, as well as
automobile loans and student loans. Automobile loans are made on both new and
used cars, and are offered for terms of up to 72 months. The Company's
automobile loans have fixed interest rates and have loan-to-value ratios of up
to 85%. Consumer loans entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage
loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by assets
that depreciate rapidly, such as automobiles, mobile homes, boats, and
recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Loan Originations, Solicitation, Processing, and Commitments. Loan
originations are derived from a number of sources such as real estate agent
referrals, existing customers, borrowers, builders, attorneys, and walk-in
customers. Upon receiving a loan application, the Company obtains a credit
report and employment verification to verify specific information relating to
the applicant's employment, income, and credit standing. In the case of a real
estate loan, an appraiser approved by the Company appraises the real estate
intended to collateralize the proposed loan. An underwriter in the Company's
loan department checks the loan application file for accuracy and completeness,
and verifies the information provided. Pursuant to the Company's written loan
policies, all loans are approved by the Loan Committee, which meets as
necessary. After the loan is approved, a loan commitment letter is promptly
issued to the borrower.
</P>
<P>
If the loan is approved, the commitment letter specifies the terms and
conditions of the proposed loan including the amount of the loan, interest rate,
amortization term, a brief description of the required collateral, and required
insurance coverage. Commitments are typically issued for 60-day periods. The
borrower must provide proof of fire and casualty insurance on the property
serving as collateral, which insurance must be maintained during the full term
of the loan. A certificate of title, based on a title search of the property, is
generally required on all loans secured by real property. At December 31, 2003,
the Company had outstanding loan commitments of $239,100. This amount does not
include $1.2 million of the unfunded portion of loans in process.

Loan Origination Fees. In addition to interest earned on loans, the
Company generally receives fees in connection with loan originations. Mortgage
loan origination fees and certain loan origination costs, if material, are
deferred and the net fee or cost is recognized in operations using the interest
method over the contractual life of the loan. Direct loan origination costs on
other loans are expensed; as such costs are not material in amount. Fees
deferred are recognized into income immediately upon prepayment of the related
loan. Such fees vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments made and
purchased principal repayments, and competitive conditions in the mortgage
markets, which in turn respond to the demand and availability of money.

Mortgage-Backed Securities
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
A part of the Company's business involves investments in mortgage-backed
securities. At December 31, 2003, all of the Company's mortgage-backed
securities were insured or guaranteed by a United States Government agency or
sponsored corporation. The Company's entire mortgage-backed securities portfolio
consists of pass-through certificates. The Company invests in mortgage-backed
securities to supplement local loan originations as well as to reduce interest
rate risk exposure.
</P>
<P>
The Company's pass-through certificates represent a participation interest
in a pool of single-family mortgages, the principal and interest payments on
which are passed from the mortgage originators, through intermediaries
(generally quasi-governmental agencies) that pool and repackage the
participation interest in the form of securities, to investors such as the
Company. Such quasi-governmental agencies that guarantee the payment of
principal and interest to investors include the FHLMC, GNMA, or the FNMA.
Pass-through certificates typically are issued with stated principal amounts,
and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with
interest rates and maturities that are within a specified range. The underlying
pool of mortgages can be composed of either fixed rate mortgage loans or ARM
loans. The interest rate risk characteristics of the underlying pool of
mortgages, i.e., fixed rate or adjustable rate, are passed on to the certificate
holder.

At December 31, 2003 mortgage-backed securities totaled $1.6 million, or
1.6%, of total assets. ARM loans collateralized 59.9% of the Company's
mortgage-backed securities portfolio, and fixed-rate loans collateralized 40.7%
of the Company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio. All of the Company's
mortgage-backed securities are insured or guaranteed by the FHLMC, the GNMA, or
the FNMA. At December 31, 2003, all the Company's mortgage-backed securities
were classified as &quot;held to maturity.&quot; At December 31, 2003, the Company's
mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a fair value of $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Effective February 1992, the OTS adopted Thrift Bulletin 52 (&quot;TB 52&quot;).
Among other things, TB 52 sets forth certain guidelines with respect to
depository institutions' investment in certain &quot;high risk mortgage securities.&quot;
&quot;High-risk mortgage securities&quot; are defined as any mortgage derivative product
that at the time of purchase, or at any subsequent date, meets any of three
tests that are set forth in TB 52. High-risk mortgage securities may be
purchased only in limited circumstances, and if held in a portfolio, must be
reported as trading assets at market value, or as available-for-sale assets at
the lower of cost or market value. In certain circumstances, OTS examiners may
seek the orderly divestiture of high-risk mortgage securities. As of December
31, 2003, the Company did not hold any &quot;high-risk mortgage securities&quot; in its
portfolio.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Delinquencies and Classified Assets
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Delinquencies. The Company's collection procedures provide that when a
loan is 15 days past due, a computer-generated late charge notice is sent to the
borrower requesting payment, plus a late charge. If delinquency continues, early
in the second month, a delinquent notice is mailed along with a letter or
telephone call advising that the mortgagors are in violation of the terms of
their mortgage contract. If a loan becomes 60 days past due, the loan becomes
subject to possible legal action. Management has been authorized by the Board of
Directors to send a letter during the third month advising of pending legal
action. This letter generally grants mortgagors an additional 15 days to bring
the account to date prior to start of any legal action. If not paid, foreclosure
proceedings are initiated. To the extent required by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (&quot;HUD&quot;) regulations, generally within 45 days of
delinquency, a Section 160 HUD notice is given to the borrower, which provides
access to consumer counseling services.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage10"></A>
<P>
It is sometimes necessary and desirable to arrange special repayment
schedules with mortgagors to prevent foreclosure or filing for bankruptcy. The
mortgagors are required to submit a written repayment schedule, which is closely
monitored for compliance. Under these terms, the account is brought to date,
usually within a few months.
</P>
<P>
Nonperforming Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed
on a nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of
additional interest is doubtful. Mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status
generally when either principal or interest is more than 90 days past due.
Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is
charged against interest income.
</P>
<P>
Real estate acquired by the Company as a result of foreclosure or by deed
in lieu of foreclosure is deemed real estate owned (&quot;REO&quot;) until such time as it
is sold. In general, the Company considers collateral for a loan to be
in-substance foreclosed if: (i) the borrower has little or no equity in the
collateral; (ii) proceeds for repayment of the loan can be expected to come only
from the operation or sale of the collateral; and (iii) the borrower has either
formally or effectively abandoned control of the collateral to the Company, or
retained control of the collateral but is unlikely to be able to rebuild equity
in the collateral or otherwise repay the loan in the foreseeable future. Cash
flow attributable to in-substance foreclosures is used to reduce the carrying
value of the collateral.
</P>
<P>
When REO is acquired or otherwise deemed REO, it is recorded at the lower
of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its estimated fair value,
less estimated selling expenses. Valuations are periodically performed by
management, and any subsequent decline in fair value is charged to operations.
At December 31, 2003, the Company had no REO.
</P>
<P>
Delinquent Loans and Nonperforming Assets. The following table sets forth
information regarding non-accrual loans delinquent 90 days or more and real
estate owned by the Company at the dates indicated. When a loan is delinquent 90
days or more, the Company fully reserves all accrued interest thereon and ceases
to accrue interest thereafter. See notes 1 and 3 to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. As of the dates indicated, the Company did not have any
restructured loans within the meaning of SFAS 15.

Classification of Assets. Federal regulations provide for the
classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities
considered by the OTS to be of lesser quality as &quot;substandard,&quot; &quot;doubtful,&quot; or
&quot;loss&quot; assets. An asset is considered &quot;substandard&quot; if it is inadequately
protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the
collateral pledged, if any. &quot;Substandard&quot; assets include those characterized by
the &quot;distinct possibility&quot; that the savings institution will sustain &quot;some loss&quot;
if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as &quot;doubtful&quot; have all
of the weaknesses inherent in those classified &quot;substandard,&quot; with the added
characteristic that the weaknesses present make &quot;collection or liquidation in
full,&quot; on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, &quot;highly
questionable and improbable.&quot; Assets classified as &quot;loss&quot; are those considered
&quot;uncollectible&quot; and of such little value that their continuance as assets
without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets
that do not expose the savings institution to risk sufficient to warrant
classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess some
weaknesses, are required to be designated &quot;special mention&quot; by management. Loans
designated as special mention are generally loans that, while current in
required payments, have exhibited some potential weaknesses that, if not
corrected, could increase the level of risk in the future. At December 31, 2003,
the Company had no special mention loans, $940,000 in substandard assets and
$79,000 in doubtful assets.

Allowance for Loan Losses. Management's policy is to provide for estimated
losses on the Company's loan portfolio based on management's evaluation of the
estimated losses that may be incurred. The Company regularly reviews its loan
portfolio, including problem loans, to determine whether any loans require
classification or the establishment of appropriate reserves or allowances for
losses. Such evaluation, which includes a review of all loans of which full
collectibility of interest and principal may not be reasonably assured,
considers, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying
collateral. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
recorder $ 0, $80,000, and $0, respectively, in provision for loan losses. The
Company's allowance for loan losses totaled $383,000, $404,000, and $378,000 at
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Management believes that the allowances for losses on loans are adequate.
While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans future
additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in economic
conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of
their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowances for
losses on loans and investments in real estate. Such agencies may require the
Company to recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about
information available to them at the time of their examination.

the analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the years indicated.

The Company's investment portfolio comprises investment securities, FHLB
stock, and interest-earning deposits in other institutions. The Company has $2.0
million in corporate debt securities, all of which were rated A2 or better. At
December 31, 2003, $4.3 million, or 16.3% of the Company's investment securities
were scheduled to mature in one year or less, $15.6 million, or 58.9%, were
scheduled to mature in from one to five years, and $6.6 million, or 24.9%, were
scheduled to mature in over five years.
</P>
<P>
The Company is required under federal regulations to maintain a minimum
amount of liquid assets that may be invested in specified short-term securities
and certain other investments. The Company generally has maintained a portfolio
of liquid assets that exceeds regulatory requirements. Liquidity levels may be
increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives and
upon management's judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields then available
in relation to other opportunities and its expectation of the level of yield
that will be available in the future, as well as management's projections as to
the short term demand for funds to be used in the Company's loan origination and
other activities. Currently, due to lower demand for loans, the Company's
liquidity levels are higher than they have been in recent periods. Management
believes that the higher levels are prudent because of the possibility that
interest rates may increase. By maintaining high levels of liquidity, the
Company is able to reinvest its assets more quickly in response to changes in
market interest rates, thereby potentially reducing its exposure to interest
rate volatility.

Sources of Funds
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
General. The Company's deposit-gathering activities are currently
conducted from the Company's facility in Webster City, Iowa. Deposits are the
major source of the Company's funds for lending and other investment purposes.
In addition to deposits, the Company derives funds from the amortization and
prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, the maturity of investment
securities, and operations. Scheduled loan principal repayments are a relatively
stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments
are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions.
Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the
availability of funds from other sources or on a longer term basis for general
business purposes. Historically, the Company has maintained a high level of
liquidity, and only rarely uses borrowed funds.
</P>
<P>
Deposits. Consumer and commercial deposits are attracted principally from
within the Company's market area through the offering of a broad selection of
deposit instruments including NOW accounts, passbook savings, money market
deposit, term certificate accounts and individual retirement accounts. Deposit
account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the period of time
during which the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among
other factors. The maximum rate of interest, which the Company must pay, is not
established by regulatory authority. The Company regularly evaluates its
internal cost of funds, surveys rates offered by competing institutions, reviews
the Company's cash flow requirements for lending and liquidity, and executes
rate changes when deemed appropriate. The Company has sought to decrease the
risk associated with changes in interest rates by offering competitive rates on
deposit accounts and by pricing certificates of deposit to provide customers
with incentives to choose certificates of deposit with longer terms. Due to the
current low market interest rate environment, however, terms of over 36 months
are not attractive to customers. The Company does not obtain funds through
brokers through a solicitation of funds outside its market area. The Company
also obtains funds from local governmental sources and held approximately $2.6
million in such funds at December 31, 2003.
</P>
<P>
Deposit Portfolio. Savings in the Company as of December 31, 2003, were
represented by the various types of deposit programs described below.

Borrowings
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Deposits are the Company's primary source of funds. The Company may also
obtain funds from the FHLB. FHLB advances are collateralized by selected assets
of the Company. Advances from the FHLB are secured by the Company's stock in the
FHLB and a portion of the Company's first mortgage loans and investment
securities. Historically, the Company has rarely used borrowed funds, but at
December 31, 2003, the Company had $9.7 million in borrowed funds.
</P>
<P>
The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for the
Company and other member savings associations and financial institutions. As a
member, the Company is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is
authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of
its home mortgages and other assets (principally, securities that are
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States) provided certain standards
related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several
different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of
maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are
based either on a fixed percentage of a member institution's net worth or on the
FHLB's assessment of the institution's creditworthiness.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
As a federally chartered SAIF-insured savings association, the Bank is
subject to examination, supervision and extensive regulation by the OTS and the
FDIC. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&quot;FHLB&quot;) system. This
regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities
in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection
of the insurance fund and depositors. The Bank also is subject to regulation by
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &quot;Federal Reserve
Board&quot;) governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and certain other
matters. The OTS examines the Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of
the Bank's Board of Directors on any deficiencies that they may find in the
Bank's operations. The FDIC

<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage19"></A>
<P>
also examines the Bank in its role as the administrator of the SAIF. The Bank's
relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great
extent by both federal and state laws especially in such matters as the
ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of the Bank's mortgage
documents. Any changes in such regulation, whether by the FDIC, OTS or Congress,
could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their
operations.
</P>
<P>
The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to
savings associations set forth herein does not purport to be a complete
description of such statutes and regulations and their effect on the Bank and
the Company.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Business Activities. The activities of savings institutions are governed
by federal law. The federal banking statutes (1) restrict the solicitation of
brokered deposits by savings institutions that are troubled or not
well-capitalized, (2) prohibit the acquisition of any corporate debt security
that is not rated in one of the four highest rating categories, (3) restrict the
aggregate amount of loans secured by non-residential real estate property to
400% of capital, (4) permit savings and loan holding companies to acquire up to
5% of the voting shares of non-subsidiary savings institutions or savings and
loan holding companies without prior approval, and (5) permit bank holding
companies to acquire healthy savings institutions.
</P>
<P>
Loans to One Borrower. Under federal law, savings institutions are
generally subject to the national bank limits on loans to one borrower or a
related group of borrowers. Generally, this limit is 15% of the Bank's
unimpaired capital and surplus on an unsecured basis. An additional amount may
be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loan is secured
by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain securities
and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. The Bank's maximum
loans-to-one-borrower limit was $1.5 million at December 31, 2003. As of
December 31, 2003, the Bank was in compliance with its loans-to-one-borrower
limitations.
</P>
<P>
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Federal law requires savings institutions to
meet a qualified thrift lender (&quot;QTL&quot;) test. Under the QTL test, a savings
association is required to maintain at least 65% of its &quot;portfolio assets&quot;
<BR>
(total assets less (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (ii)

business) in certain &quot;qualified thrift investments,&quot; primarily residential
mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related
securities on a monthly average basis in 9 out of every 12 months. A savings
association that fails the QTL test must either convert to a bank charter or
operate under certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2003, the Bank maintained
86.7% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore,
met the QTL test.
</P>
<P>
Capital Distributions. OTS regulations govern capital distributions by
federal savings banks, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other
transactions charged to the capital account of a savings bank. A savings bank
must file an application for OTS approval of a capital distribution if either
<BR>
(1) the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the
sum of the savings bank's net income for that year to date plus the bank's
retained net income for the preceding two years, (2) the savings bank would not
be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution, (3) the
distribution would violate any applicable statue, regulation, agreement or
OTS-imposed condition, or (4) the savings bank is not eligible for expedited
treatment of its filings. If an application is not required to be filed, a
savings bank which is a subsidiary of a holding company, as well as certain
other savings banks, must still file a notice with the OTS at least 30 days
before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital
distribution. Any additional capital distributions would require prior OTS
approval. If the Bank's capital falls below its required levels or the OTS
notifies it that it is in need of more than normal supervision, the Bank's
ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the OTS
may prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution, which would
otherwise be permitted by regulation, if the OTS determines that the
distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity. The Bank is required to maintain an average daily balance of
specified liquid assets equal to a monthly average of not less than a specified
percentage of its net withdrawable deposit accounts plus borrowings payable in
one year or less. This liquidity requirement is currently 4%. The Bank's average
liquidity ratio for December 2003 exceeded the then applicable requirements. The
Bank has never been subject to monetary penalties for failure to meet its
liquidity requirements.

Assessments. Savings institutions are required by OTS regulation to pay
assessments to the OTS to fund the operations of the OTS. The general
assessment, paid on a semi-annual basis, is computed upon the savings
institution's consolidated total assets, as reported in the institution's latest
quarterly thrift financial report. Based on the assets size of the Bank it was
required to pay a semi-annual assessment of approximately $16,900.
</P>
<P>
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. Federal savings banks
have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related
regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision to help meet the credit needs of
their communities, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition,
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from
discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics
specified in those statutes. An institution's failure to comply with the
provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in
regulatory restrictions on its activities, and failure to comply with the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement
actions by the Office of Thrift Supervision, as well as other federal regulatory
agencies and the Department of Justice. The Bank received a &quot;satisfactory&quot;
Community Reinvestment Act rating under the current Community Reinvestment Act
regulations in its most recent federal examination by the Office of Thrift
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Transactions with Related Parties. The Bank's authority to engage in
transactions with related parties or &quot;affiliates&quot; or to make loans to certain
insiders, is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (&quot;FRA&quot;).
<BR>
Section 23A limits the aggregate amount of transactions with any individual
affiliate to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution and also
limits the aggregate amount of transactions with all affiliates to 20% of the
savings institution's capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates
are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in
<BR>
Section 23A and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally
prohibited. Section 23B provides that certain transactions with affiliates,
including loans and asset purchases, must be on terms and under circumstances,
including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as
favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions
are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that
are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may
purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and
10% stockholders, as well as entities controlled by such persons, is currently
governed by Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA, and Regulation O thereunder.
Among other things, these regulations require such loans to be made on terms
substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and do not
involve more than the normal risk of repayment. Regulation O also places
individual and aggregate limits on the amount of loans the Bank may make to such
persons based, in part, on the Bank's capital position, and requires certain
approval procedures to be followed. At December 31, 2003, the Bank was in
compliance with the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Enforcement. OTS has primary enforcement responsibility over savings
institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all
&quot;institution-related parties,&quot; including stockholders, and any attorneys,
appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful
action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal
enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease
and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institutions,
receivership, conservator ship or the termination of deposit insurance. Civil
penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000
per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties
may be as high as $1 million per day. Criminal penalties for most financial
institution crimes include fines of up to $1 million and imprisonment for up to
30 years. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the Director of OTS that
enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If
action is not taken by the Director, the FDIC has authority to take such action
under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking agencies have
adopted regulations that set forth the safety and soundness standards that the
federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured
depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The standards address
internal controls and information systems; internal audit system; credit
underwriting; loan documentation; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; and
compensation, fees and benefits. If the appropriate federal banking agency
determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the
Guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an
acceptable plan
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">

<A NAME="eolPage21"></A>
<P>
to achieve compliance with the standard. The regulations establish deadlines for
the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.
</P>
<P>
Capital Requirements. The Office of Thrift Supervision capital regulations
require federal savings banks to meet three minimum capital standards: a 1.5%
tangible capital ratio; a 4% leverage ratio (3% for institutions receiving the
highest rating on the CAMELS rating system); and an 8% risk-based capital ratio.
In addition, the prompt corrective action standards discussed below also
establish, in effect, a minimum 2% tangible capital standard, a 4% leverage
ratio (3% for institutions receiving the highest CAMELS rating), and together
with the risk-based capital standard itself, a 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital
standard. Institutions must generally deduct from capital investments in and
loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities as principal that are not
permissible for a national bank.
</P>
<P>
The risk-based capital standards for federal savings banks require the
maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital
and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4% and 8%
respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets,
including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weighted
factor of 0% to 100%, assigned by the Office of Thrift Supervision capital
regulation based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Core (tier
<BR>
1) capital is defined as common stockholders' equity (including retained
earnings), certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus
and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less
intangible assets other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card
relationships. The components of supplementary capital currently include
cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory
convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the
allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of
risk-weighted assets, and up to 45% of unrealized gains on available-for-sale
equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Overall, the
amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital may not exceed
100% of core capital.
</P>
<P>
The capital regulations also incorporate an interest rate risk component.
Savings institutions with &quot;above normal&quot; interest rate risk exposure are subject
to a deduction from capital for purposes of calculating their risk-based capital
requirements. For the present time, the Office of Thrift Supervision has
deferred implementation of the interest rate risk capital charge. At December
31, 2003 the Bank met each of its capital requirements.
</P>

The following table sets forth the Bank's actual and required capital
amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2003.

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&quot;FHLB&quot;) of Des Moines,
which is one of the 12 regional FHLBs. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is
required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines in an amount
equal to the greater of 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans,
home purchase contracts or similar obligations at the beginning of each year, or
1/20th (or such greater fraction as established by the FHLB) of outstanding FHLB
advances. At December 31, 2003 the Bank had $555,400 in FHLB stock, which was in
compliance with this requirement. In past years the Bank has received dividends
on its FHLB stock. Dividends for the year ended December 31, 2003, averaged
3.00%. Certain provisions of FIRREA require all 12 Federal Home Loan Banks to
provide financial assistance for the resolution of troubled savings associations
and to contribute to affordable housing programs through direct loans or
interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and
moderate-income housing projects. These contributions could cause rates on the
FHLB advances to increase and could affect adversely the level of FHLB dividends
paid and the value of FHLB stock in the future.

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Under the OTS Prompt Corrective Action regulations, the OTS is required to
take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the
severity of which depends upon the institution's degree of capitalization.
Generally, a savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than
8.0% or a leverage ratio or a Tier 1 core capital ratio that is less than 4.0%
is considered to be undercapitalized. A savings institution that has total
risk-based capital less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 core risk-based capital ratio of
less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be
&quot;significantly undercapitalized&quot; and a savings institution that has a tangible
capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be &quot;critically
undercapitalized.&quot; The banking regulator is required to appoint a receiver or
conservator for an institution that is &quot;critically undercapitalized.&quot; The
regulation also provides that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the
OTS within 45 days of the date an institution receives notice that it is
&quot;undercapitalized,&quot; &quot;significantly undercapitalized&quot; or &quot;critically
undercapitalized.&quot; In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become
immediately applicable to the institution, including, but not limited to,
restrictions on growth, investment activities, capital distributions, and
affiliate transactions. The OTS could also take any one of a number of
discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive
and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.

Holding Company Regulation
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
General. WCF Financial, M.H.C. which owns the majority of the Company's
common stock outstanding (the &quot;Holding Company&quot;) and the Company are
non-diversified mutual savings and loan holding companies. As such, the Holding
Company and the Company are registered with the OTS and are subject to OTS
regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition,
the OTS has enforcement authority over the Holding Company and the Company and
their non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority
permits the OTS to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a
serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. As federal corporations, the
Company and the Holding Company are generally not subject to state business
organizations law.
</P>
<P>
The OTS is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in
a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in
more than one state, subject to two exceptions: (i) the approval of interstate
supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies, and (ii) the
acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state
of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company including the
Holding Company and the Company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more
subsidiaries, from acquiring another savings institution or holding company
thereof, without prior written approval of the OTS. It also prohibits the
acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a
non-subsidiary savings institution, a non-subsidiary holding company, or a
non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by
federal law; or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not
federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire
savings institutions, the OTS must consider the financial and managerial
resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect
of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund, the convenience and needs
of the community and competitive factors.
</P>
<P>
Federal law generally provides that no &quot;person,&quot; acting directly or
indirectly or through or in concert with one or more other persons, may acquire
&quot;control,&quot; as that term is defined in OTS regulations, of a federally-insured
savings institution without giving at least 60 days written notice to the OTS
and providing the OTS an opportunity to disapprove of the proposed acquisition.
Such acquisitions of control may be disapproved if it is determined, among other
things, that (i) the acquisition would substantially lessen competition; (ii)
the financial condition of the acquiring person might jeopardize the financial
stability of the savings institution or prejudice the interests of its
depositors; or (iii) the

competency, experience or integrity of the acquiring person or the proposed
management personnel indicates that it would not be in the interest of the
depositors or the public to permit the acquisition of control by such person.

<P>
Restrictions Applicable to Mutual Holding Companies. Pursuant to federal
law and OTS regulations and policy, a mutual holding company such as the Holding
Company, and a mid-tier holding company, such as the Company may engage in the
following activities: (i) investing in the stock of a savings association; (ii)
acquiring a mutual association through the merger of such association into a
savings association subsidiary of such holding company or an interim savings
association subsidiary of such holding company; (iii) merging with or acquiring
another holding company; one of whose subsidiaries is a savings association;
<BR>
(iv) investing in a corporation, the capital stock of which is available for
purchase by a savings association under federal law or under the law of any
state where the subsidiary savings association or associations share their home
offices; (v) furnishing or performing management services for a savings
association subsidiary of such company; (vi) holding, managing or liquidating
assets owned or acquired from a savings subsidiary of such company; (vii)
holding or managing properties used or occupied by a savings association
subsidiary of such company properties used or occupied by a savings association
subsidiary of such company; (viii) acting as trustee under deeds of trust; (ix)
any other activity (A) that the Federal Reserve Board, by regulation, has
determined to be permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) of
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, unless the Director, by regulation,
prohibits or limits any such activity for savings and loan holding companies; or
(B) in which multiple savings and loan holding companies were authorized (by
regulation) to directly engage on March 5, 1987; and (x) purchasing, holding, or
disposing of stock acquired in connection with a qualified stock issuance if the
purchase of such stock by such savings and loan holding company is approved by
the Director. If a mutual holding company acquires or merges with another
holding company, the holding company acquired or the holding company resulting
from such merger or acquisition may only invest in assets and engage in
activities listed in (i) through (x) above, and has a period of two years to
cease any non-conforming activities and divest of any non-conforming
investments.
</P>
<P>
Waiver of Dividends. OTS regulations require the Holding Company, to
notify the OTS of any proposed waiver of its right to receive dividends. The
OTS' reviews dividend waiver notices on a case-by-case basis, and, in general,
not object to any such waiver if: (i) the Holding Company's board of directors
determines that such waiver is consistent with such directors' fiduciary duties
to the Holding Company's members; (ii) dividends waived by the Holding Company
are considered as a restriction on the retained earnings of the savings
institution, which restriction, if material, is disclosed in the public
financial statements of the savings institution as a note to the financial
statements; (iii) the amount of any dividend waived by the Holding Company is
available for declaration as a dividend solely to the Holding Company, and, in
accordance with SFAS 5, where the savings institution determines that the
payment of such dividend to the Holding Company is probable, an appropriate
dollar amount is recorded as a liability; (iv) the amount of any waived dividend
is considered as having been paid by the savings institution in evaluating any
proposed dividend under OTS capital distribution regulations; and (v) in the
event the Holding Company converts to stock form, the appraisal submitted to the
OTS in connection with the conversion application takes into account the
aggregate amount of the dividends waived by the Holding Company.
</P>
<P>
Conversion of the Mutual Holding Company to Stock Form. OTS regulations
permit the Holding Company to convert from the mutual to the stock form of
ownership (a &quot;Conversion Transaction&quot;). There can be no assurance when, if ever,
a Conversion Transaction will occur. In a Conversion Transaction a new holding
company would be formed as the successor to the Company (the &quot;New Holding
Company&quot;), the Holding Company's corporate existence would end, and certain
depositors of the Bank would receive the right to subscribe for additional
shares of the New Holding Company. In a Conversion Transaction, each share of
Common Stock held by the Company's public stockholders (&quot;Minority Shareholders&quot;)
would be automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock of the
New Holding Company determined pursuant an exchange ratio that ensures that
after the Conversion Transaction, subject to any adjustment to reflect the
receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares, the percentage of the to-be
outstanding shares of the New Holding Company issued to Minority Stockholders in
exchange for their Common Stock would be equal to the percentage of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock held by Minority Stockholders immediately
prior to the Conversion Transaction.

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC

</P>
<P>
The Company is a member of the SAIF, which is administered by the FDIC.
Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and such insurance is
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. As insurer,
the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct
examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also
may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC
determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the FDIC. The FDIC
also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings
institutions, after giving the OTS an opportunity to take such action, and may
terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has
engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.
</P>
<P>
The FDIC's SAIF deposit insurance premiums are assessed through a
risk-based system under which all insured depository institutions are placed
into one of nine categories and assessed insurance premiums, ranging from .23%
to .67% of deposits, based upon their level of capital and supervisory
evaluation. Under the system, institutions classified as well capitalized (i.e.,
a core capital ratio of at least 5%, a ratio of Tier 1 or core capital to
risk-weighted assets (&quot;Tier 1 risk-based capital&quot;) of at least 6% and a
risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%) and considered healthy pay the lowest
premium while institutions that are less than adequately capitalized (i.e., core
or Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of less than 4% or a risk-based capital
ratio of less than 8%) and considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the
highest premium. Risk classification of all insured institutions will be made by
the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period.
</P>
<P>
The FDIC is authorized to increase assessment rates, on a semiannual
basis, if it determines that the reserve ratio of the SAIF will be less than the
designated reserve ratio of 1.25% of SAIF insured deposits. In setting these
increased assessments, the FDIC must seek to restore the reserve ratio to that
designated reserve level, or such higher reserve ratio as established by the
FDIC. The FDIC may also impose special assessments on SAIF members to repay
amounts borrowed from the United States Treasury or for any other reason deemed
necessary by the FDIC. The Company anticipates that its ongoing annual SAIF
premiums will be approximately $12,000.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
On July 30, 2002, the President George W. Bush signed into law the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&quot;Sarbanes-Oxley&quot;), which implemented legislative
reforms intended to address corporate and accounting fraud. In addition to the
establishment of a new accounting oversight board that will enforce auditing,
quality control and independence standards and will be funded by fees from all
publicly traded companies, Sarbanes-Oxley places certain restrictions on the
scope of services that may be provided by accounting firms to their public
company audit clients. Any non-audit services being provided to a public company
audit client will require pre-approval by the company's audit committee. In
addition, Sarbanes-Oxley makes certain changes to the requirements for audit
partner rotation after a period of time. Sarbanes-Oxley requires chief executive
officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalent, to certify to the
accuracy of periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
subject to civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willingly violate
this certification requirement. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have signed certifications to this Form 10-K as required by
Sarbanes-Oxley. In addition, under Sarbanes-Oxley, counsel will be required to
report evidence of a material violation of the securities laws or a breach of
fiduciary duty by a company to its chief executive officer or its chief legal
officer, and, if such officer does not appropriately respond, to report such
evidence to the audit committee or other similar committee of the board of
directors or the board itself.
</P>
<P>
Under Sarbanes-Oxley, longer prison terms will apply to corporate
executives who violate federal securities laws; the period during which certain
types of suits can be brought against a company or its officers is extended; and
bonuses issued to top executives prior to restatement of a company's financial
statements are now subject to disgorgement if such restatement was due to
corporate misconduct. Executives are also prohibited from trading the company's
securities during retirement plan &quot;blackout&quot; periods, and loans to company
executives (other than loans by financial institutions permitted by federal
rules and regulations) are restricted. In addition, a provision directs that
civil penalties levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a result of
any judicial or administrative action under Sarbanes-Oxley be deposited to a
fund for the benefit of harmed investors. The Federal Accounts for Investor
Restitution provision also requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to
develop methods of improving collection rates. The legislation accelerates the
time frame for disclosures by public companies, as they must immediately
disclose any material changes in their financial condition or operations.
Directors and executive officers must also provide information for most changes
in ownership in a company's securities within two business days of the change.
</P>

<P>
Sarbanes-Oxley also increases the oversight of, and codifies certain
requirements relating to audit committees of public companies and how they
interact with the company's &quot;registered public accounting firm.&quot; Audit committee
members must be independent and are absolutely barred from accepting consulting,
advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer. In addition, companies must
disclose whether at least one member of the committee is a &quot;financial expert&quot;
(as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) and if not,
why not. Under Sarbanes-Oxley, a company's registered public accounting firm is
prohibited from performing statutorily mandated audit services for a company if
such company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, comptroller,
chief accounting officer or any person serving in equivalent positions had been
employed by such firm and participated in the audit of such company during the
one-year period preceding the audit initiation date. Sarbanes-Oxley also
prohibits any officer or director of a company or any other person acting under
their direction from taking any action to fraudulently influence, coerce,
manipulate or mislead any independent accountant engaged in the audit of the
company's financial statements for the purpose of rendering the financial
statements materially misleading. Sarbanes-Oxley also requires the Securities
and Exchange Commission to prescribe rules requiring inclusion of any internal
control report and assessment by management in the annual report to
shareholders. Sarbanes-Oxley requires the company's registered public accounting
firm that issues the audit report to attest to and report on management's
assessment of the company's internal controls.
</P>
<P>
Although we anticipate that we will incur additional expense in complying
with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the resulting regulations,
management does not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on
our results of operations or financial condition.

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Federal Taxation
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax
return on a calendar year basis. The Holding Company is not permitted to file a
consolidated federal income tax return with the Company. Thus, the Holding
Company files a separate federal income tax return on a calendar year basis.
</P>
<P>
The Holding Company and the Company are subject to the rules of federal
income taxation generally applicable to corporations under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the &quot;Code&quot;).
</P>
<P>
As a result of the enactment of the Small Business Job Protection Act of
1996, all savings banks and savings associations will be able to convert to a
commercial bank charter, diversify their lending, or be merged into a commercial
bank without having to recapture any of their pre-1998 tax bad debt reserve
accumulations. Any post-1987 reserves will be subject to recapture, regardless
of whether or not a particular thrift intends to convert its charter, be
acquired, or diversify its activities. The recapture tax on post-1987 reserves
is assessed in equal installments over the six year period beginning in 1996.
However, if a thrift meets a minimum level of mortgage lending test (i.e., if
the thrift's level of mortgage lending activity (re-financing and home equity
loans do not count) is equal to or exceeds its average mortgage lending activity
for the six years preceding 1996, adjusted for inflation), then the thrift may
suspend its tax bad debt recapture for the 1996 and 1997 tax years. At December
31, 2003 and 2002, the Bank had federal income tax bad debt reserves of
approximately $2.4 million, which constitute allocations to bad debt reserves
for federal income tax purposes for which no provision for taxes on income had
been made.
</P>
<P>
Savings institutions such as Bank that meet certain definitional tests
relating to the composition of assets and other prescribed by the Code are
permitted to establish reserves for bad debts and to make annual additions which
may, within specified formula limits, be taken as a deduction in computing
taxable income for federal income tax purposes. The amount of the bad debt
reserve deduction is computed under the experience method.
</P>
<P>
If a savings institution ceases to qualify as a &quot;bank&quot; (as defined in Code
<BR>
Section 581) for bad debt purposes or converts to a credit union, the pre-1988
reserves and the supplemental reserves are restored to income ratably over a
six-year period, beginning in the tax year the savings institution no longer
qualifies as a bank. The pre-1988 reserves are also subject to recapture in the
case of certain excess distributions including distributions on liquidation and
dissolution and redemptions of shareholders.

In addition to the regular income tax the Company is generally subject to
a minimum tax calculation. An alternative minimum tax is imposed at a minimum
tax rate of 20% on alternative minimum taxable income, which is the sum of a
corporation's regular taxable income (which certain adjustments) and tax
preference items, less any available exemption. The alternative minimum tax is
imposed to the extent it exceeds Company's regular income tax and net operating
losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum income.
</P>
<P>
The Company is accounting for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No.
109, &quot;Accounting for Income Taxes.&quot; The liability method accounts for deferred
income taxes by applying the enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance
sheet date to differences between the book cost and the tax cost of assets and
liabilities. The resulting deferred tax liabilities and assets are adjusted to
reflect changes in tax laws.

The State of Iowa imposes a tax on the Iowa franchise taxable income of
savings institutions at the rate of 5%. Iowa franchise taxable income is
generally similar to federal taxable income except that interest from state and
municipal obligations is taxable, and no deduction is allowed for state
franchise taxes.

The state corporation income tax ranges from 6% to 12% depending upon Iowa

Letter to Shareholders:
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company is pleased to report a profitable year for 2003. Net income for 2003
was $1,186,600 or $.31 per diluted share. Return on average assets for 2003 was
1.10%.
</P>
<P>
The Company announced a two-for-one stock split which was paid September 24,
2003. The stock price at the close of 2002 was $9.50 per share (adjusted for the
stock split). The 2003 year end price was $14.00 per share, for an increase of
47% from the prior year.
</P>
<P>
The Board of the Company increased the dividend paid to shareholders in the 4th
quarter of 2003 by 36% over the prior quarter.
</P>
<P>
With historically low interest rates, refinancing of mortgage loans was at
record levels in 2003. Webster City Federal Savings Bank, subsidiary of the
Company, has generally been a portfolio lender, and chose to keep loan rates
somewhat higher than the market rather than put long term assets on the books at
the low interest rate levels. While many borrowers did refinance with the bank,
the bank did see a reduction in outstanding loans for the year.
</P>
<P>
Investment securities increased during 2003, with investments laddered to be in
a position to make changes as market opportunities arise.
</P>
<P>
The capital position of the bank remains strong. Combined with our high
liquidity levels, we believe we can take advantage of opportunities that may
arise, meet the challenges of our uncertain times and be a valuable asset in our
shareholder's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
We have a staff and board that is truly committed to our mission of being a
highly profitable financial center providing friendly, convenient service to all
customers.
</P>
<P>
Thank you to our shareholders for continuing to believe in our company as we do.
</P>
<P>
Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
Phyllis A. Murphy

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
<BR>
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
General
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Webster City Federal Bancorp (the &quot;Company&quot;) is a savings and loan holding
company whose primary asset is 100% of the outstanding shares of Webster City
Federal Savings Bank (the &quot;Bank&quot;), which reorganized into the holding company
structure, effective July 1, 1999. The discussion herein to the results of the
Company refers to the results of the Bank in the periods prior to July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Company focuses on establishing and maintaining long-term
relationships with customers, and is committed to serving the financial service
needs of the communities in its market area. The Company attracts retail
deposits from the general public and uses those deposits, together with borrowed
funds, to originate residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and consumer
loans.
</P>
<P>
The Company's current business strategy is to operate the Bank as a
well-capitalized, profitable and independent community-oriented savings bank
dedicated to providing quality customer service. Generally, the Company has
sought to implement this strategy primarily by using retail deposits, public
funds and, to a lesser extent, Federal Home Loan Bank advances as its source of
funds and maintaining a substantial part of its assets in loans secured by one-
to four-family residential real estate located in the Company's market area,
home equity loans, consumer loans, mortgage-backed securities and in other
liquid investment securities. Specifically, the Company's business strategy
incorporates the following elements: (1) operating the Bank as a
community-oriented financial institution, maintaining a strong core customer
base by providing quality service and offering customers the access to senior
management and services that a community-based institution can offer; (2)
maintaining high asset quality by emphasizing investment in residential mortgage
loans, mortgage-backed securities and other securities issued or guaranteed by
the United States Government or agencies thereof; (3) maintaining capital in
excess of regulatory requirements and growing only to the extent that adequate
capital levels can be maintained; and (4) managing interest rate risk exposure
while achieving desirable levels of profitability.
</P>
<P>
The earnings of the Company depend primarily on its level of net interest
income, which is the difference between interest earned on its interest-earning
assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans, home equity loans, consumer
loans, mortgage-backed securities, interest-bearing deposits at other
institutions, investment securities and other investments, and the interest paid
on interest-bearing liabilities, which consist of savings deposits and advances
from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Net interest income is a function of the
Company's interest rate spread, which is the difference between the average
yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on
interest-bearing liabilities, as well as a function of the average balance of
interest-earning assets as compared to interest-bearing liabilities. The
Company's earnings also are affected by its level of non-interest income
including primarily service fees and charges, and non-interest expense,
including primarily compensation and employee benefits, and SAIF deposit
insurance premiums. Earnings of the Company also are affected significantly by
general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in market
interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities, which
events are beyond the control of the Company.
</P>
<P>
The Company's critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for
losses on loans. In management's opinion, it is adequate to absorb probable loan
losses in the existing portfolio. In evaluating the portfolio, management takes
into consideration numerous factors, including current economic conditions,
prior loan loss experience, the composition of the loan portfolio, underlying
collateral and management's estimate of probable credit losses. The allowance
for loan loss is established through a provision for loss based on management's
evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, the composition of the
portfolio, specific impaired loans and current economic conditions. Such
evaluation, which includes a review of all loans on which full collectibility
may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, the estimated net
realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic
conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant
recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss experience.

Comparison of Financial Condition
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Total assets increased $1.2 million, or 1.1%, to $104.8 million at
December 31, 2003 from $103.6 million at December 31, 2002. Deposits increased
by $639,000, or .1%, to $70.9 million at December 31, 2003 from $70.2 million at
December 31, 2002. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1.8 million, or
34.7%, to $3.4 million at December 31, 2003 from $5.3 million at December 31,
2002. The Company had time deposits of $12.3 million in other financial
institutions at the end of 2003. Investments (other than mortgage-backed
securities) increased $6.9 million, or 80.7%, to $15.5 million at December 31,
2003 from $8.6 million at December 31, 2002. Net loans receivable decreased $4.3
million, or 5.9%, to $69.0 million at December 31, 2003 from $73.3 million at
December 31, 2002. Mortgage-backed securities decreased $1.1 million, or 39.4%,
to $1.6 million at December 31, 2003 from $2.7 million at December 31, 2002, due
to payments of principal. There were no additional mortgage-backed securities
purchased during the year as management sought shorter-term securities in the
lower market interest rate environment.
</P>
<P>
Stockholders' equity increased by $339,000, or 15.2%, to $22.7 million at
December 31, 2003 from $22.3 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in
stockholders' equity was due to net income of $1.2 million offset by cash
dividends of $800,800 paid to stockholders.

General. The earnings of the Company depend primarily on its level of net
interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on the
Company's interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans, home
equity loans, consumer loans, mortgage-backed securities, investment securities
and other investments, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities,
consisting of savings deposits, FHLB advances and, to a lesser extent, public
funds. The Company had net income of $1.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2003 compared to $1.4 million, and $1.2 million, for the years ended
December 31, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

The following table sets forth certain information relating to the
Company's average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on assets and
average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated and the average yields
earned and rates paid. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or
expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the
periods presented. Average balances are derived from month-end balances.
Management does not believe that the use of month-end balances rather than daily
average balances has caused any material difference in the information

Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Interest Income. Total interest income decreased $629,000 or 9.5% to $6.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $6.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in interest income resulted primarily from
the decrease in market interest rates on interest-earning assets and a decrease
in the volume of the Company's interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning
assets increased by $3.8 million to $102.1 million from $98.3 million, due to
the movement of cash into interest earning investments in 2003. The increase in
average interest-earning assets resulted primarily from an increase of $7.2
million, or 74.6%, in the average balance of other interest earning assets and
an increase in the average balance in investment securities of $3.5 million or
35.3% to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $10.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2002, offset by a decrease of $1.3
million or 38.2% in average balance of mortgage-backed securities, and a $5.6
million, or 7.5%, decrease in the average balance of net loans receivable.
</P>
<P>
Interest income on loans receivable decreased by $821,000, or 14.5%, to
$4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $5.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002. This decrease in interest income was the result of a
net decrease in average loans outstanding for 2003 as compared to 2002, due to
decreased loan originations and increased loan repayments. The average yield on
the loan portfolio decreased to 7.00% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from
7.57% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company's use of a lagging index
for its adjustable rate loans, as well as the lower rate environment, caused the
overall yield on the loan portfolio to decrease in 2003 compared to 2002.
Interest income on mortgage-backed securities decreased by $94,000, or 45.1%, to
$115,000. This decrease in interest income resulted from a decrease in average
mortgage-backed securities outstanding of $1.3 million, or 38.2% in 2003 and a
decrease in average yield on mortgage-backed securities to 5.59% from 6.35% for
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, due to lower market
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Interest Expense. Total interest expense decreased by $370,000, or 13.5%,
to $2.4 million for the year ended

December 31, 2003 from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The
decrease in interest expense was the result of a decrease in the average cost of
funds to 2.60% from 3.27% on deposits during 2003 compared to 2002, due to a
lower interest rate environment in 2003 compared to 2002. The average cost of
borrowings decreased by 6 basis points to 5.17% for 2003 compared to 5.23% for
2002.
</P>
<P>
Provision for Loan Losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan
losses based upon management's evaluation of risks in the loan portfolio, the
Company's past loan loss experience, and current and expected future economic
conditions. The Company had no provision for loan losses for the year ended
December 31, 2003 and 2001, and $80,000 in provisions in the year ended December
31, 2002. Management believes that it has maintained its allowance for loan
losses at a level that is adequate to provide for probable loan losses, although
there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed estimated amounts.

Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased by $260,000 or 6.6% to
$3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $3.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002. The principal reason net interest income decreased was
that the Company's interest rate spread decreased to 2.99% for 2003 compared to
3.24% for 2002.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest Income. Non-interest income increased by $3,000, or .7%, to
$404,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, from $401,000 for the same period
ended December 31, 2002. The increase in non-interest income was due to
increased fee income on loan modifications and deposits.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased by $162,000, or 8.0%,
to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $2.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. Non-interest expense consists primarily of
salaries and employee benefits, premises and occupancy costs, furniture and
equipment expense, data processing expense, SAIF deposit insurance premiums and
stock related expenses. Salaries and employee benefits increased $36,000 or 3.1%
to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $1.1 million
for the year ended December 2002, due to normal annual salary adjustments.
Office property and equipment decreased $49,000 or 23.4% due to decreased
depreciation taken on equipment, Data processing expenses increased $46,000 or
28.3% to $207,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $161,000 for
the same period ended 2002. The increase in data processing was due to the Bank
adding internet banking services to its list of services offered.
</P>
<P>
Income Taxes. Income tax expense decreased by $88,000, or 11.5%, to
$678,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $766,000 for the same period
in 2002. The effective tax rate for 2003 was 36.4% compared to 34.8% for 2002.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and

Interest Income. Total interest income decreased $60,300 or .9% to $6.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $6.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest income resulted primarily from
the decrease in market interest rates on interest-earning assets partially
offset by an increase in the volume of the Company's interest-earning assets.
Average interest-earning assets increased by $3.4 million to $98.3 million from
$94.5 million. The increase in average interest-earning assets resulted
primarily from an increase of $2.4 million, or 3.3%, in the average balance of
net loans receivable and an increase in the average balance in investment
securities of $4.0 million or 6.4% to $10.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2002 compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, offset
by a decrease of $1.6 million or 31.8% in average balance of mortgage-backed
securities, and a $1.3 million, or 11.9%, decrease in the average balance of
other interest-earning assets, as management sought to stay liquid during this
time of falling interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Interest income on loans receivable increased by $48,000, or .9%, to $5.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $5.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001. This increase in interest income was the result of a
net increase in average loans outstanding for 2002 as compared to 2001, due to
increased loan originations. The average yield on the loan portfolio decreased
to 7.57% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 7.76% for the year ended
December 31, 2001. The Company's use of a lagging index for its adjustable rate
loans, as well as the lower rate environment, caused the overall yield on the
loan portfolio to decrease in 2002 compared to 2001. Interest income on
mortgage-backed securities decreased by $134,400, or 39.0%, to $209,500. This
decrease in interest income resulted from a decrease in average mortgage-backed
securities outstanding of $1.6 million, or 31.8% and a decrease in average yield
on mortgage-backed securities to 6.35% from 6.83% due to lower market interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Interest Expense. Total interest expense decreased by $729,000, or 21.0%,
to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $3.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001. The principal reason for the decrease in interest
expense was a decrease in the amount of interest paid on deposits during 2002
compared to 2001, due to a lower interest rate environment in 2002 compared to
2001, offset by an increase of $61,200 or 13.7% from $445,700 in 2001 to
$506,900 in 2002 paid on borrowings at the FHLB Bank. The average cost of
borrowings decreased by 50 basis points to 5.23% for 2002 compared to 5.73% for
2001.

Provision for Loan Losses. The Company maintains an allowance for loan
losses based upon management's evaluation of risks in the loan portfolio, the
Company's past loan loss experience, and current and expected future economic
conditions. The Company had $80,000 in provision for loan losses for the year
ended December 31, 2002, and no provision in the year ended December 31, 2001.
Management believes that it has maintained its allowance for loan losses at a

that the Company's interest rate spread increased to 3.24% for 2002 compared to
2.40% for 2001.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest Income. Non-interest income decreased by $54,900, or 12.0%,
to $401,400 for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $456,300 for the same
period ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in non-interest income was due to
decreased fee income on loan originations and deposits.

<P>
Non-interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased by $168,400, or 9.0%,
to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001. Non-interest expense consists primarily of
salaries and employee benefits, premises and occupancy costs, furniture and
equipment expense, data processing expense, SAIF deposit insurance premiums and
stock related expenses. Salaries and employee benefits increased $134,400 or
13.3% to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1.0
million for the year ended December 2001. The increase was due to a $34,700
increase in the amount of contribution required to be made to the Bank's defined
benefit retirement plan. Premises and equipment increased $81,000 or 64.3% due
to increased depreciation taken on equipment and increased data processing
expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decline in other
miscellaneous expenses.

<P>
Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased by $118,000, or 18.2%, to
$766,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $648,000 for the same period
in 2001. The effective tax rate for 2002 was 34.8% compared to 35.3% for 2001.

Market Risk Management
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and
rates. The Company's market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk
resulting from its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking.
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates might
adversely affect the Company's net interest income or the economic value of its
portfolio of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. Management
continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate this risk. Management
does not believe that the Company's primary market risk exposure and how those
exposures were managed in 2003 have changed when compared to 2002. Market risk
limits have been established by the Board of Directors based on the Company's
tolerance for risk.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage43"></A>
<P>
The Company's policy in recent years has been to reduce its exposure to
interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities and interest
rates of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities by emphasizing ARM
loans and fixed-rate one-to-four-family mortgage loans with terms of 15 years or
less, and by maintaining relatively high levels of liquidity. By maintaining a
significant percentage of its assets in cash and other liquid investments, the
Company is able to reinvest a higher percentage of its assets more quickly in
response to changes in market interest rates, thereby reducing its exposure to
interest rate volatility. In addition, the Company offers competitive rates on
deposit accounts and prices certificates of deposit to provide customers with
incentives to choose certificates of deposit with longer terms.
</P>
<P>
The Company primarily relies on the OTS Net Portfolio Value Model (the
Model) to measure its susceptibility to interest rate changes. Net portfolio
value (NPV) is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from
existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing
liabilities plus or minus the present value of net expected cash flows from
existing off-balance sheet contracts, if any. The Model estimates the current
economic value of each type of asset, liability, and off-balance sheet contract
after various assumed instantaneous, parallel shifts in the Treasury yield curve
both upward and downward.
</P>
<P>
The NPV Model uses an option-based pricing approach to value one-to-four
family mortgages, mortgages serviced by or for others, and firm commitments to
buy, sell, or originate mortgages. This approach makes use of an interest rate
simulation program to generate numerous random interest rate paths that, in
conjunction with a prepayment model, are used to estimate mortgage cash flows.
</P>
<P>
Prepayment options and interest rate caps and floors contained in
mortgages and mortgage-related securities introduce significant uncertainty in
estimating the timing of cash flows for these instruments that warrants the use
of this sophisticated methodology. All other financial instruments are valued
using a static discounted cash flow method. Under this approach, the present
value is determined by discounting the cash flows the instrument is expected to
generate by the yields currently available to investors from an instrument of
comparable risk and duration.
</P>
<P>
The following table sets forth the present value estimates for major
categories of financial instruments of the Company at September 30, 2003, as
calculated by the OTS NPV Model. The table shows the present value of the
instruments under rate shock scenarios of -100 basis points to +300 basis points
in increments of 100 basis points. OTS has suppressed all model outputs
associated with the -300 bps scenario because of the abnormally low prevailing
interest rate environment. As illustrated in the table, the Company's NPV is
more sensitive in a rising rate scenario than in a falling rate scenario. As
market rates increase, the market value of the Company's large portfolio of
mortgage loans and securities declines significantly and prepayments slow. As
interest rates decrease, the market value of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed
securities increase less dramatically due to prepayment risk, periodic rate
caps, and other embedded options.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company adjusts its liquidity levels in order to meet funding needs of
deposit outflows, payment of real estate taxes on mortgage loans, repayment of
borrowings and loan commitments. The Company also adjusts liquidity as
appropriate to meet its asset and liability management objectives.
</P>
<P>
The Company's primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and
repayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment
securities and other investments, and earnings and funds provided from
operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed
securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan
prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic
conditions, and competition. The Company manages the pricing of its deposits to
maintain a desired deposit balance. In addition, the Company invests in
short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending
requirements. At December 31, 2003, $7.8 million, or 24.6%, of the Company's
investment portfolio (including cash, deposits in other financial institutions,
FHLB stock, Bankers Bank stock and securities) was scheduled to mature in one
year or less, $15.7 million, or 49.5%, was scheduled to mature in one to five
years, and $8.2 million, or 25.9% was scheduled to mature in over five years.
For additional information about cash flows from the Company's operating,
financing, and investing activities, see Statements of Cash Flows included in
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
</P>
<P>
A major portion of the Company's liquidity consists of cash and cash
equivalents, which are a product of its operating, investing, and financing
activities. The primary sources of cash are net earnings, principal repayments
on loans and mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts.
Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business
management. If the Company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them
internally, it may borrow from the FHLB, which provides an additional source of
funds.
</P>
<P>
At December 31, 2003, the Company had core capital of $22.6 million, or
21.6% of adjusted total assets, which was

approximately $18.1million above the minimum requirements of 4.0% of adjusted
total assets in effect on that date. On December 31, 2003, the Company had
risk-based capital of $22.9 million (including $22.6 million in core capital),
or 48.8% of risk-weighted assets. This amount was $19.2 million above the 8%
requirement in effect on that date. The Company is presently in compliance with
the fully phased-in capital requirements.
</P>
<P>
At December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding loan commitments of
$239,100. This amount does not include $1.2 million of the unfunded portion of
loans in process. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one
year as of December 31, 2003 totaled $19.0 million. Based on prior experience,
management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with
the Company.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and notes thereto,
presented elsewhere herein, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial
position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and
due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of
the Company's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all the
assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary. As a result, interest rates
have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of
general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same
direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services.

Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&quot;FASB&quot;) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, &quot;Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations&quot; (&quot;SFAS No. 143&quot;). SFAS No. 143 amends FASB Statement No.
19, &quot;Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,&quot; and
applies to all entities. The statement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and the associated retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and that result
from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a
long-lived asset, except for certain obligation of lessees. The Company adopted
SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have a
material effect on the Company's financial statements.
</P>
<P>
In August, 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 144, &quot;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets&quot; (&quot;SFAS No. 144&quot;). SFAS No. 144 supersedes FASB Statement No. 121,
&quot;Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets To
Be Disposed Of,&quot; and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No.
30, &quot;Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of
a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions,&quot; for the disposal of a segment of a business (as
previously defined in that opinion). SFAS 144 requires that one accounting model
be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held
and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued
operations to include more disposal transactions then were included under the
previous standards. The Company adopted SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002. The
effects of implementation were immaterial.
</P>
<P>
In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 145, &quot;Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.&quot;(&quot;SFAS No. 145') SFAS 145
rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, &quot;Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment
of Debt,&quot; and an amendment of the Statement, FASB Statement No. 64,
&quot;Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements.&quot; SFAS 145
also rescinds FASB Statement No. 44, &quot;Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor
Carriers.&quot; Finally, SFAS 145 amends FASB Statement No. 13, &quot;Accounting for
Leases,&quot; to eliminate inconsistency between the required accounting for
sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease
modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback
transactions and amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make
various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability
under changed conditions. The provisions of SFAS 145 related to the rescission
of FASB Statement No. 4 are to be applied in fiscal years beginning after May
15, 2002 (January 1, 2003 for the Company) with any gain or loss on
extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior
periods presented that does not meet the criteria in APB Opinion 30 for
classification as an extraordinary item being reclassified. The provisions of
SFAS 145 related to FASB Statement No. 13 that relate to modifications of a
capital lease that make it an operating lease

became effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. The Company
adopted this standard on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 did not
have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
</P>
<P>
In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146, &quot;Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.&quot;
(&quot;SFAS 146&quot;) SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3, &quot;Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)&quot;. (EITF Issue 94-3&quot;) One of the principal
differences between SFAS 146 and EITF Issue 94-3 pertains to the criteria for
recognizing a liability for exit or disposal costs. Under EITF Issue 94-3,
liability for such costs was recognized as of the date of an entity's commitment
to an exit plan. Pursuant so SFAS146, a liability is recorded as of the date an
obligation is incurred. SFAS 146 requires that an exit or disposal liability be
initially measured at fair value. Provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit
or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company
adopted this standard on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 146 did not have
a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
</P>
<P>
In October 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 147, &quot;Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions&quot;. SFAS 147
removes acquisitions of financial institution from the scope of both SFAS No.
72, &quot;Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift Institutions&quot; and
FIN 9 and requires that those transactions be accounted for in accordance with
SFAS 141 and 142. Thus, the requirement to recognize (and subsequently amortize)
any excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value of
tangible and identifiable assets acquired as an unidentifiable intangible asset
no longer applies to acquisitions within the scope of SFAS 147. Entities with
previously recognized unidentifiable intangible assets that are still amortizing
them in accordance with SFAS 72 must, effective the latter of the date of
acquisition or the full adoption of SFAS 142, reclassify those intangible assets
to goodwill and terminate amortization of them. The Company adopted SFAS 147 on
October 1, 2002 and the adoption resulted in no reclassification or revisions to
prior period financial statements.
</P>
<P>
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, &quot;Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others&quot; (&quot;FIN 45&quot;), which addresses the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under guarantees. These disclosure requirements
are included in Note 21 of these consolidated financial statements. FIN 45 also
requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of
certain guarantees. FIN 45 requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for
the non-contingent component of the guarantee, which is the obligation to stand
ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions
occur. The initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the
guarantee at inception. The recognition of the liability is required even if it
is not probable that payment will be required under the guarantee or if the
guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with
multiple elements. The Company Adopted the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 at
December 31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on the
Company's financial statements. The disclosure requirements are effective for
financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after December 15,
2002 and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P>
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, &quot;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure&quot; (&quot;SFAS 148&quot;). SFAS 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123, &quot;Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation&quot;, to provide new guidance concerning transition
when an entity changes from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method
of accounting for employee stock-based compensation cost. As amended by SFAS
148, SFAS 123 now also requires additional information to be disclosed regarding
such costs in annual financial statements and in condensed interim statements of
public companies. In general, the new transition requirements are effective for
financial statements for fiscal years after December 15, 2002. Earlier
application is permitted if statements for a fiscal year ending December 15,
2002 have not yet been issued as of December 2002. Interim disclosures are
required for reports containing financial statements for periods beginning after
December 15, 2002. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic method under ABP 25 and plans to continue to do so while providing the
disclosures provided for in SFAS 123. The Company adopted the annual disclosure
requirements for SFAS 148 for purposes of it December 31, 2002 consolidated
financial statements and adopted the interim disclosures requirement of SFAS 148
beginning with its interim financial statements for the period ended March 31,
2003.

In January, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
&quot;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities&quot; and, in December 2003, issued
Revised Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46R), &quot;Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,&quot; which replaced FIN 46. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions
of FIN 46 effective December 31, 2002. On

February 1, 2003, the Company adopted the recognition and measurement of
provisions of FIN 46 for variable interest entities (VIE's) formed after January
31, 2003, and, on December 31, 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46R. The Company
has no newly formed variable interest entity subject to the provisions of FIN
<BR>
46. The adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46R did not have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 149, &quot;Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities&quot; (&quot;SFAS 149&quot;). SFAS 149 amends Statement 133 for decisions made (1)
as part of the Derivates Implementation Group process that effectively required
amendments to Statement 133, (2) in connection with other FASB projects dealing
with financial instruments, and (3) in particular, the meaning of &quot;an initial
net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of
contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market
factors,&quot; the meaning of &quot;underlying,&quot; and the characteristics of a derivative
that contains financing components. FASB 149 is generally effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging
relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The Company adopted SFAS 149 on
July 1, 2003 and such adoption did not have a material effect on its financial
position or results of operations.
</P>
<P>
In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150 (FAS 150), &quot;Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.&quot; This Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and
measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities
and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is
within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of
those instruments were previously classified as equity. This Statement was
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003,
and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003, except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of
nonpublic entities. On October 29, 2003, the FASB voted to defer for an
indefinite period the application of the guidance in FAS 150, to non-controlling
interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a
subsidiary but would be classified as a liability on the parent's financial
statements. The adoption of the sections of this Statement that have not been
deferred did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial condition
or results of operation. The section noted above that has been deferred
indefinitely is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's
financial condition or results of operations.

<P>
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (&quot;AICPA&quot;) has
issued a Statement of Position (&quot;SOP&quot;) &quot;Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt
Securities Acquired in a Transfer&quot;. The SOP is effective for loans acquired in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. It includes such loans acquired
in purchase business combinations and would apply to all enterprises. The SOP
limits the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) to the excess of the
investor's estimate of undiscounted expected future principle and interest cash
flows (expected future cash flows) over the investor's initial investment in the
loan. The implementation of this SOP is not expected to have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Safe Harbor Statement
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company intends such
forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for
forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Reform Act of
1995, and is including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor
provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions
and describe future plans, strategies and expectations of the Company, are
generally identifiable by use of the words &quot;believe,&quot; &quot;expect,&quot; &quot;intend,&quot;
&quot;anticipate,&quot; &quot;estimate,&quot; &quot;project&quot; or similar expressions. The Company's
ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is
inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the
operations and future prospects of the Company and the subsidiaries include, but
are not limited to, changes in: interest rates, general economic conditions, the
legislative/regulatory situation, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S.
Government, including polices of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve
Board, the quality of composition of the loan or investment portfolios, demand
for loan products, deposit flows, competition, demand for financial services in
the Company's market area and accounting principles, policies and guidelines.
These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking
statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Further,
information concerning the Company and its business, including additional
factors that could materially affect the Company's financial results, is
included in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Board of Directors

Webster City Federal Bancorp
<BR>
Webster City, Iowa:
</P>
<P>
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Webster City
Federal Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P>
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Webster City Federal
Bancorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices
</P>
<P>
(a)   Description of Business
</P>
<P>
Webster City Federal Bancorp (the Company) and its subsidiaries,
Webster City Federal Savings Bank (the Bank) and Security Title and
Abstract, Inc., conduct operations in Webster City, Iowa, a
community of approximately 8,000 people. The Bank is primarily
engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general
public in its market area and investing such deposits in mortgage
loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate. The
Bank's primary area for lending and other financial services
consists of Hamilton County, Iowa, and the surrounding contiguous
counties. Security Title and Abstract, Inc. is engaged in the
business of providing abstracting and title services. The primary
area for these services consists of Hamilton County, Iowa, and the
surrounding contiguous counties.
</P>
<P>
Webster City Federal Bancorp was formed on July 1, 1999 pursuant to
a plan of reorganization adopted by the Bank and its stockholders.
Pursuant to the reorganization, each share of Webster City Federal
Savings Bank stock held by existing stockholders of the Bank was
exchanged for a share of common stock of Webster City Federal
Bancorp. The reorganization had no financial statement impact and is
reflected for all prior periods presented. Approximately 60% of the
Company's common stock is owned by WCF Financial M.H.C., a mutual
holding company (the Holding Company). The remaining 40% of the
Company's common stock is owned by the general public including the
Bank's Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
</P>
<P>
(b)   Principles of Consolidation
</P>
<P>
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Webster City Federal Bancorp, Security Title and Abstract, Inc.,
Webster City Federal Savings Bank, and the Bank's wholly owned
subsidiary, WCF Service Corporation, which is engaged in the sales
of mortgage life and credit life insurance to the Bank's loan
customers. All material inter-company accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In preparing such financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance
sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could
differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that
are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the
determination of the allowance for loan losses.
</P>
<P>
(c)   Earnings Per Share Computations
</P>
<P>
The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 128, Earnings per Share for basic and diluted earnings
per share calculation and reporting standards.
</P>
<P>
Earnings per share-basic for 2003 is computed using the 3,776,752
weighted average common shares outstanding for the year, net of
524,476 weighted average treasury shares and divided into the net
earnings of $1,186,588. Earnings per share-diluted for 2003 is
computed using the 3,776,752 weighted average common shares
outstanding and adding the dilutive effect of stock options totaling
2,882 shares and divided into the net earnings of $1,186,588.
</P>
<P>
All shares and earnings per share numbers have been restated for the
stock split. Earnings per share-basic for 2002 is computed using the
3,763,568 weighted average common shares outstanding for the year,
net of 262,238 weighted average treasury shares and divided into the
net earnings of

<A NAME="eolPage55"></A>
<P>
$1,437,294. Earnings per share-diluted for 2002 is computed using
the 3,763,568 weighted average common shares outstanding and adding
the dilutive effect of stock options totaling 6,900 shares and
divided into the net earnings of $1,437,294.
</P>
<P>
All shares and earnings per share numbers have been restated for the
stock split. Earnings per share-basic for 2001 is computed using the
3,737,538 weighted average common shares outstanding for the year,
net of 508,462 weighted average treasury shares and divided into the
net earnings of $1,189,899. Earnings per share-diluted for 2001 is
computed using the 3,737,538 weighted average common shares
outstanding and adding the dilutive effect of stock options totaling
5,513 shares and divided into the net earnings of $1,189,899.
</P>
<P>
(d)   Stock Option Plan
</P>
<P>
The Company applies the intrinsic-value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations including FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation
of APB Opinion No. 25, issued in March 2000, the account for its
fixed-plan stock options. Under this method, compensation expense is
recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of
the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, established accounting and
disclosure requirements using a fair-value-based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed
by SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue to apply the
intrinsic-value-based method of accounting described above, and has
adopted only the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income if the
fair-value-based method had been applied to all outstanding and
unvested awards in each period.

The Company provides pro forma net earnings and pro forma earnings
per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in 1996
and subsequent years as if the fair-value-based method, which
recognizes as expense over the vesting period the fair value of
stock-based awards at the date of grant, had been applied. The
impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options under SFAS
148 is reflected in the pro forma net income amounts presented above
over the options' vesting period which was three years. There were
no options granted in 2003, 2002, and 2001.

<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage56"></A>
<P>
(e)   Cash and Cash Equivalents
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of reporting cash flows, the Company includes cash
and due from other financial institutions and time deposits in other
financial institutions with original maturities of three months or
less in cash and cash equivalents. Included as cash equivalents at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, were interest-bearing deposits totaling
$3,110,506 and $5,084,384, respectively.
</P>
<P>
(f)   Securities
</P>
<P>
Investment securities are classified based on the Company's intended
holding period. Securities which the Company has the ability and
positive intent to hold to maturity are classified as
held-to-maturity. Securities held principally for the purpose of
near-term sales are classified as trading. Securities which may be
sold prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs, to respond to market
changes, or to adjust the Company's asset-liability position are
classified as available-for-sale. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
Bank had no trading securities.
</P>
<P>
Securities held-to-maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for
amortization of premiums, and accretion of discounts. Trading
securities are carried at fair value, with gains and losses, both
realized and unrealized, included in operations. Securities
available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with the aggregate
unrealized gains or losses, net of the effect of taxes on income,
reported as a component of stockholders' equity. Other than
temporary unrealized losses are recorded in the consolidated
statement of operations and a new cost basis is established for the
security.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage-backed securities are classified as held-to-maturity at
amortized cost. Premiums and discounts are amortized and accreted
using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual
maturity, adjusted for prepayments. Actual prepayment experience is
periodically reviewed, and the amortization and accretion are
adjusted accordingly. These investments are not carried as
available-for-sale, as the Company has the ability and it is
management's positive intent to hold them to maturity.
</P>
<P>
Net realized gains or losses are shown in the statements of
operations using the specific identification method.
</P>
<P>
(g)   Allowance for Losses on Loans
</P>
<P>
The allowance for losses on loans is maintained at an amount
considered adequate to provide for such losses. The allowance for
losses on loans is based on management's periodic evaluation of the
loan portfolio and reflects an amount that, in management's opinion,
is adequate to absorb probable losses in the existing portfolio. In
evaluating the portfolio, management takes into consideration
numerous factors, including current economic conditions, prior loan
loss experience, the composition of the loan portfolio, value of
underlying collateral, and management's estimate of anticipated
credit losses.
</P>
<P>
Accrued interest receivable on loans which become more than ninety
days in arrears are charged to an allowance which is established by
a charge to interest income. Interest income is subsequently
recognized only to the extent cash payments are received until, in
management's judgment, the borrower's ability to make periodic
interest and principal payments is back to normal, in which case the
loan is returned to accrual status.
</P>
<P>
Under the Company's credit policies, all loans with interest more
than ninety days in arrears and restructured loans are considered
impaired loans. Loan impairment is measured based on the present
value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate except, where

<P>
more practical, at the observable market price of the loan or the
fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent.
</P>
<P>
(h)   Loan Origination Fees and Related Costs
</P>
<P>
Mortgage loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination
costs are deferred, and the net fee or cost is amortized using the
interest method over the estimated life of the loan. Direct loan
origination costs for other loans are expensed; as such costs are
not material in amount.
</P>
<P>
Premiums and discounts in connection with mortgage loans purchased
are amortized over the term of the loans using the interest method.
</P>
<P>
(i)   Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
</P>
<P>
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as
long as there is no violation of any conditions established in the
contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of
the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the
total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements (see note 3). The Company evaluates each customer's
creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral
obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company, upon extension of
credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the
counterparty.
</P>
<P>
(j)   Office Property and Equipment
</P>
<P>
Office property and equipment are recorded at cost, and depreciation
is provided primarily by the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets, which range from ten to fifty
years for the office building and improvements and five to
twenty-five years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Maintenance and repairs are charged against income. Expenditures for
improvements are capitalized and subsequently depreciated. The cost
and accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed
of are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation
accounts. Related profit or loss from such transactions is credited
or charged to income.
</P>
<P>
(k)   Taxes on Income
</P>
<P>
The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income
tax return. Federal taxes on income are allocated based on taxable
income or loss included in the consolidated return. For state tax
purposes, the Bank files a franchise tax return and the Company,
Security Title and Abstract, Inc., and WCF Service Corporation file
corporate income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method for taxes on
income and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage58"></A>
<P>
(l)   Fair Value of Financial Instruments
</P>
<P>
The Company discloses estimated fair values for its financial
instruments. Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set
forth below:
</P>
<P>
o     Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits in other financial
institutions - The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of
fair value.
</P>
<P>
o     Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity - The fair
value of investment securities is estimated based on bid
prices published in financial newspapers, bid quotations
received from securities dealers, or quoted market prices of
similar instruments, adjusted for differences between the
quoted instruments and the instruments being valued.
</P>
<P>
o     Loans - Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with
similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by
type, such as real estate, consumer, and commercial. The fair
value of loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash
flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market
discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk
inherent in the loan. The estimate of maturity is based on the
Company's historical experience, with repayments for each loan
classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the
effect of current economic and lending conditions. The effect
of nonperforming loans is considered in assessing the credit
risk inherent in the fair value estimate.
</P>
<P>
o     FHLB stock - The value of FHLB stock is equivalent to its
carrying value because the stock is redeemable at par value.
</P>
<P>
o     Bankers Bank stock - The value of Bankers Bank stock is
equivalent to its carrying value because the stock is
redeemable at par value.
</P>
<P>
o     Accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable - The
recorded amount of accrued interest receivable and accrued
interest payable approximates fair value as a result of the
short-term nature of the instruments.
</P>
<P>
o     Deposits - The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity,
such as passbook, money market, non-interest bearing checking,
and NOW accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand.
The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the
discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate
is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of
similar remaining maturities. The fair value estimates do not
include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding
provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of
borrowing funds in the market.
</P>
<P>
o     FHLB advances - The fair value of the FHLB advances is based
on the discounted value of the cash flows. The discount rate
is estimated using the rates currently offered for fixed rate
advances of similar remaining maturities.
</P>
<P>
o     Off-balance sheet assets (liabilities) - The unrealized gains
and losses of commitments to extend credit are estimated using
the difference between current levels of interest rates and
committed rates. The unrealized gains and losses of letters of
credit are based on fees currently charged for similar
agreements.
</P>
<P>
o     Limitations - Fair value estimates are made at a specific
point in time, based on relevant market information and
information about the financial instrument. Because no market
exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial
instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments
regarding future expected loss experience, current economic
conditions, risk characteristics of various financial
instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective
in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment and,

<P>
therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.
</P>
<P>
(m)   Certain amounts in the 2002 and 2001 consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation
used in the 2003 consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P>
(n)   Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
</P>
<P>
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&quot;FASB&quot;)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,
&quot;Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations&quot; (&quot;SFAS No. 143&quot;). SFAS
No. 143 amends FASB Statement No. 19, &quot;Financial Accounting and
Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,&quot; and applies to all
entities. The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting
for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. It applies to
legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and that result from the acquisition,
construction, development and/or the normal operation of a
long-lived asset, except for certain obligation of lessees. The
Company adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of
SFAS No. 143 did not have a material effect on the Company's
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
In August, 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 144, &quot;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets&quot; (&quot;SFAS No. 144&quot;). SFAS No. 144 supersedes FASB
Statement No. 121, &quot;Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets To Be Disposed Of,&quot; and the
accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30,
&quot;Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions,&quot; for the disposal of
a segment of a business (as previously defined in that opinion).
SFAS 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived
assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used
or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued
operations to include more disposal transactions then were included
under the previous standards. The Company adopted SFAS No. 144 on
January 1, 2002. The effects of implementation were immaterial.
</P>
<P>
In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 145, &quot;Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44,
and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections.&quot;(&quot;SFAS No. 145') SFAS 145 rescinds FASB Statement No.
4, &quot;Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,&quot; and an
amendment of the Statement, FASB Statement No. 64, &quot;Extinguishments
of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements.&quot; SFAS 145 also
rescinds FASB Statement No. 44, &quot;Accounting for Intangible Assets of
Motor Carriers.&quot; Finally, SFAS 145 amends FASB Statement No. 13,
&quot;Accounting for Leases,&quot; to eliminate inconsistency between the
required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required
accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic
effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions and amends
other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their
applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of SFAS 145
related to the rescission of FASB Statement No. 4 are to be applied
in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002 (January 1, 2003 for
the Company) with any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that
was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented
that does not meet the criteria in APB Opinion 30 for classification
as an extraordinary item being reclassified. The provisions of SFAS
145 related to FASB Statement No. 13 that relate to modifications of
a capital lease that make it an operating lease became effective for
transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. The Company adopted this
standard on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 did not
have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

<P>
In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 146, &quot;Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities.&quot; (&quot;SFAS 146&quot;) SFAS 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No.
94-3, &quot;Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)&quot;. (EITF Issue 94-3&quot;) One of the
principal differences between SFAS 146 and EITF Issue 94-3 pertains
to the criteria for recognizing a liability for exit or disposal
costs. Under EITF Issue 94-3, liability for such costs was
recognized as of the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan.
Pursuant so SFAS146, a liability is recorded as of the date an
obligation is incurred. SFAS 146 requires that an exit or disposal
liability be initially measured at fair value. Provisions of SFAS
146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted this standard on
January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 146 did not have a material
effect on the Company's financial statements.
</P>
<P>
In October 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 147, &quot;Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions&quot;.
SFAS 147 removes acquisitions of financial institution from the
scope of both SFAS No. 72, &quot;Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of
Banking or Thrift Institutions&quot; and FIN 9 and requires that those
transactions be accounted for in accordance with SFAS 141 and 142.
Thus, the requirement to recognize (and subsequently amortize) any
excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value
of tangible and identifiable assets acquired as an unidentifiable
intangible asset no longer applies to acquisitions within the scope
of SFAS 147. Entities with previously recognized unidentifiable
intangible assets that are still amortizing them in accordance with
SFAS 72 must, effective the latter of the date of acquisition or the
full adoption of SFAS 142, reclassify those intangible assets to
goodwill and terminate amortization of them. The Company adopted
SFAS 147 on October 1, 2002 and the adoption resulted in no
reclassification or revisions to prior period financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,
&quot;Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others&quot; (&quot;FIN 45&quot;),
which addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under
guarantees. These disclosure requirements are included in Note 21 of
these consolidated financial statements. FIN 45 also requires the
recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of
certain guarantees. FIN 45 requires the guarantor to recognize a
liability for the non-contingent component of the guarantee, which
is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that
specified triggering events or conditions occur. The initial
measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at
inception. The recognition of the liability is required even if it
is not probable that payment will be required under the guarantee or
if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a
transaction with multiple elements. The Company Adopted the
disclosure requirements of FIN 45 at December 31, 2002 and are not
expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial
statements. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial
statements of interim and annual periods ending after December 15,
2002 and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial
statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, &quot;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure&quot; (&quot;SFAS 148&quot;). SFAS 148 amends FASB
Statement No. 123, &quot;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&quot;, to
provide new guidance concerning transition when an entity changes
from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method of
accounting for employee stock-based compensation cost. As amended by
SFAS 148, SFAS 123 now also requires additional information to be
disclosed regarding such costs in annual financial statements and in
condensed interim statements of public companies. In general, the
new transition requirements are effective for financial statements
for fiscal years after December 15,

2002. Earlier application is permitted if statements for a fiscal
year ending December 15, 2002 have not yet been issued as of
December 2002. Interim disclosures are required for reports
containing financial statements for periods beginning after December
15, 2002. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using
the intrinsic method under ABP 25 and plans to continue to do so
while providing the disclosures provided for in SFAS 123. The
Company adopted the annual disclosure requirements for SFAS 148 for
purposes of it December 31, 2002 consolidated financial statements
and adopted the interim disclosures requirement of SFAS 148
beginning with its interim financial statements for the period ended
March 31, 2003.

In January, 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
&quot;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities&quot; and, in December 2003,
issued Revised Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46R), &quot;Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,&quot; which replaced FIN 46. The Company
adopted the disclosure provisions of FIN 46 effective December 31,
2002. On February 1, 2003, the Company adopted the recognition and
measurement of provisions of FIN 46 for variable interest entities
(VIE's) formed after January 31, 2003, and, on December 31, 2003,
the Company adopted FIN 46R. The Company has no newly formed
variable interest entity subject to the provisions of FIN 46. The
adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46R did not have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 149, &quot;Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities&quot; (&quot;SFAS 149&quot;). SFAS 149 amends
Statement 133 for decisions made (1) as part of the Derivates
Implementation Group process that effectively required amendments to
Statement 133, (2) in connection with other FASB projects dealing
with financial instruments, and (3) in particular, the meaning of
&quot;an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required
for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a
similar response to changes in market factors,&quot; the meaning of
&quot;underlying,&quot; and the characteristics of a derivative that contains
financing components. FASB 149 is generally effective for contracts
entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging
relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The Company adopted
SFAS 149 on July 1, 2003 and such adoption did not have a material
effect on its financial position or results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150 (FAS 150),
&quot;Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics
of both Liabilities and Equity.&quot; This Statement establishes
standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and
equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument
that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some
circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified
as equity. This Statement was effective for financial instruments
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise effective
at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June
15, 2003, except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of
nonpublic entities. On October 29, 2003, the FASB voted to defer for
an indefinite period the application of the guidance in FAS 150, to
non-controlling interests that are classified as equity in the
financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a
liability on the parent's financial statements. The adoption of the
sections of this Statement that have not been deferred did not have
a significant impact on the Company's financial condition or results
of operation. The section noted above that has been deferred
indefinitely is not expected to have a significant impact on the
Company's financial condition or results of operations.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (&quot;AICPA&quot;) has
issued a Statement of Position (&quot;SOP&quot;) &quot;Accounting for Certain Loans

this SOP is not expected to have a material effect on the financial

Based upon the Company's level of historical taxable income and
anticipated future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax
assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the
Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
</P>
<P>
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Bank had federal income tax bad debt
reserves of approximately $2,430,000, which constitute allocations to bad
debt reserves for federal income tax purposes for which no provision for
taxes on income had been made. If such allocations are charged for other
than bad debt losses, taxable income is created to the extent of the
charges.

(9)   Benefit Plans
</P>
<P>
(a)   Retirement Plan
</P>
<P>
The Company is a participant in the Financial Institutions
Retirement Fund (FIRF), and substantially all of its officers and
employees are covered by the retirement plan. FIRF does not
segregate the assets, liabilities, or costs by participating
employer. According to FIRF's administrators, as of June 30, 2003
and 2002, the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the Company
made contributions of $126,778 and $79,945 and $27,474 to the plan
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
</P>
<P>
(b)   ESOP
</P>
<P>
All employees meeting the age and service requirements are eligible
to participate in the ESOP established in August 1994. Contributions
made by the Company to the ESOP are allocated to participants by a
formula based on compensation. Participant benefits become 100%
vested after five years of service. ESOP expense was $0 for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
</P>
<P>
(c)   Deferred Compensation
</P>
<P>
The Company has deferred compensation agreements with certain
directors, and at December 31, 2003 and 2002 had accrued deferred
compensation of $757,385 and $731,192,

respectively. Directors' fees deferred were $21,100, $21,100, and
$25,500 for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
</P>
<P>
(d)   Stock Option Plan
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Company adopted a stock option plan (the Plan) pursuant
to which the Company's board of directors may grant stock options to
officers, key employees, and non-employee directors of the Company.
The Plan authorizes grants of options to purchase up to 95,000
shares of authorized but unissued common stock and treasury stock.
Stock options for 80,750 shares were granted upon adoption of the
Plan. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the
stock's fair market value at the date of grant. All stock options
have ten-year terms and vest and become fully exercisable in three
equal annual installments, commencing one year from the date of
grant.
</P>
<P>
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were 14,250 additional options
available for grant under the Plan.

(a)   Regulatory Capital Requirements
</P>
<P>
The Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of
1989 (FIRREA) and the capital regulations of the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) promulgated there under require institutions to
have a minimum 3% core capital ratio and a minimum 8% risk-based
capital ratio. These capital standards set forth in the capital
regulations must generally be no less stringent than the capital
standards applicable to national banks. FIRREA also specifies the
required ratio of housing-related assets in order to qualify as a
savings institution. The Company and Bank met the regulatory capital
requirements at December 31, 2003 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(FDICIA) established additional capital requirements which require
regulatory action against depository institutions in one of the
undercapitalized categories defined in implementing regulations.
Institutions, such as the Bank, which are defined as well
capitalized, must generally have a leverage capital (core) ratio of
at least 5%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, and a
total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%. FDICIA also provides
for increased supervision by federal regulatory agencies, increased
reporting requirements for insured depository institutions, and
other changes in the legal and regulatory environment for such
institutions. The Company and Bank met the regulatory capital
requirements at December 31, 2003 and 2002.

(b)   Dividends and Restrictions Thereon
</P>
<P>
On August 20, 2003 the Company declared a payment of a tw0-for-one
stock split affected in the form of a stock dividend, for the
1,886,186 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of
September 9, 2003. The additional shares were issued as a result of
the stock split and issued to stockholders as of September 24, 2003.
All shares and earnings per share numbers have been restated for the
stock split. The board of directors of the Company declared and paid
three 13(cent) per share dividends and one 17(cent) per share
dividend in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Holding Company waived its right to receive the dividends
declared and paid during 2003.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the Company declared and paid four
13(cent) per share dividends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Federal regulations impose certain limitations on the payment of
dividends and other capital distributions by the Bank. Under the
regulations, a savings institution, such as the Bank, that will

<P>
meet the fully phased-in capital requirements (as defined by the OTS
regulations) subsequent to a capital distribution is generally
permitted to make such capital distribution without OTS approval so
long as they have not been notified of the need for more than normal
supervision by the OTS. The Bank has not been so notified and,
therefore, may make capital distributions during the calendar year
equal to net income plus 50% of the amount by which the Bank's
capital exceeds the fully phased-in capital requirement as measured
at the beginning of the calendar year. A savings institution with
total capital in excess of current minimum capital requirements but
not in excess of the fully phased-in requirements is permitted by
the new regulations to make, without OTS approval, capital
distributions of between 25% and 75% of its net income for the
previous four quarters, less dividends already paid for such period.
A savings institution that fails to meet current minimum capital
requirements is prohibited from making any capital distributions
without prior approval from the OTS.

at least once each year, by the last day of January (or such other date as may
be selected by the Board), that they have read and understand the current
version of this Code. Likewise all new Insiders are required to certify that
they have read and understand the current version of this Code within thirty
days of becoming an Insider. All executed certification statements will be
maintained in the personnel file of each Insider. No later than the meeting of
the Board of Directors held in conjunction with the annual meeting of
shareholders in each year the Compliance Officer shall report to the full Board
noting any Insiders who have not executed a current certification statement. All
information disclosed in the certification statements shall be treated on a
confidential basis, except to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the
Bank's interests or comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>
THIS CODE OF ETHICS IS INTENDED TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INSIDERS TO
EXPRESS CONCERNS RELATING TO CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY, ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF
COMPANY POLICY, FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTES AND ALLEGATIONS OF CORPORATE
MISDEEDS. THERE WILL BE NO DISCRIMINATION OR RETALIATION AGAINST ANY INSIDER WHO
REPORTS SUCH VIOLATIONS OR ALLEGATIONS IN GOOD FAITH.
</P>
<P>
Waivers. This Code is intended to apply equally to all Insiders.
Accordingly, any waiver of the standards set forth in this Code by executive
officers or directors may be made only by the Board and must be disclosed to
shareholders within 2 business days by either filing an SEC Form 8-K or the
posting notice on the Company's website continuously for 12 months (provided the
Company has disclosed to the SEC in its most recent annual report that
amendments to and waivers of the Code will be disclosed on the Company's
website).
</P>
<P>
IV.   ACCURACY IN REPORTING
</P>
<P>
Corporate Records. Each Insider has a responsibility to ensure that all
Company documents and reports for which the Insider is responsible are prepared
and maintained properly and are free of any false, misleading, incomplete or
otherwise improper information. Insiders are prohibited from defrauding,
misleading, manipulating or coercing any employees or directors of the Company
or any advisors to the Company, including outside counsel or auditors.
</P>
<P>
Financial Statements. Whenever an Insider is responsible for the
preparation or review of the Company's financial statements, the Insider shall
ensure that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principals as currently in force.
</P>
<P>
Errors or Misleading Statements. If an Insider ever becomes aware of an
error or potential misstatement in any Company documents including financial
statements or other documents filed with the SEC, the Insider must contact
immediately the Insider's supervisor and the Compliance Officer and report the
error or potential misstatement.
</P>
<P>
Audits. All Insiders shall cooperate fully with any audits of the
Company's financial statements or other corporate documents whether conducted
internally or by a third party.

<P>
V.    CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
</P>
<P>
A. In General. For purposes of this Code, a &quot;conflict of interest&quot; shall
be deemed to exist where any Insider or an affiliate of an Insider has any
personal or financial interest, direct or indirect, in any Company action,
failure to act, decision not to act or method of action, in connection with any
transaction relating to the Company's internal or external operations. As used
herein, the term &quot;affiliate of an Insider&quot; means as to a specific Insider, his
or her Immediate Family Members and any Company, partnership, limited liability
Company, trust or other entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by that
Insider or by any Immediate Family Member of that Insider. For purposes of the
previous sentence &quot;Immediate Family Member&quot; includes the spouse (or life
partner) and children of an Insider and any relative (by blood or marriage) of
that Insider or spouse (or life partner) residing in the same household as such
Insider.
</P>
<P>
Examples of conflicts of interest that would affect Insiders and the
Company's internal or external operations or conduct may include, but are not
limited to:
</P>
<P>
1.    loans which will directly or indirectly benefit directors or
officers or members of their immediate family or their related
interests;
</P>
<P>
2.    loans to competitors of directors or officers or their related
interests;
</P>
<P>
3.    the restructuring, modification or renewal of loans where such
restructuring, modification or renewal will directly or indirectly
benefit directors or officers or their related interests;
</P>
<P>
4.    the determination of the Company to enter or not enter into a
contract or other business arrangement for the delivery of goods or
the performance of services with a director or officer or their
related interests and;
</P>
<P>
5.    the availability of a business opportunity for the Company where an
Insider or their related interest might compete for or otherwise
seek this same opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Loans made to directors and officers in accordance with Company policy and
consistent with applicable regulatory requirements will not in and of itself
result in a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
Appearance of Conflict of Interest. The term &quot;conflict of interests&quot; shall
also include an appearance of a conflict of interest. An appearance of a
conflict of interest shall arise where the facts and circumstances do not give
rise to a full conflict of interest, but are so similar in nature that they may
create doubt as to the impartiality or loyalty of an Insider in connection with
the transaction where the appearance arises. Examples of appearances of a
conflict of interest include, but are not limited to:
</P>
<P>
1.    a loan by the Company to the brother-in-law of an Insider may not
provide a direct or indirect benefit to that Insider or his/her
immediate family and therefore an actual conflict of interest does
not exist. The existence of the relationship itself does, however,
create the appearance of such a conflict and thus would require the
director or officer to recuse him/herself from any decision-making
process relating to the transaction.
</P>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage81"></A>
<P>
2.    an Insider who assumes responsibility for analyzing and recommending
approval of a loan to a director, a major shareholder or an employee
of another financial institution with which the Insider has a
personal loan or an ongoing financial relationship may not present a
direct conflict of interest. The existence of the relationship
itself does, however, create the appearance of a conflict and thus
requires that the Insider recuse himself/herself from any
decision-making process relating to the loan and abstain from any
further action thereon. Also, the Insider should make full
disclosure of the appearance of a conflict prior to the Company's
approval of such a loan.
</P>
<P>
B.    Recusal and Recordation
</P>
<P>
Disclosure and Recusal. Whenever an Insider has a conflict of interest in
connection with an internal or external operation or other conduct of the
Company, the Insider shall make a full disclosure of the nature of the conflict
of interest, recuse himself/herself from the decision-making process and abstain
from any further action thereon.
</P>
<P>
Recordation. Whenever an Insider has declared a conflict of interest in
connection with a transaction, such declaration and the Insider's recusal and
abstention from the decision-making process shall be reported to the Compliance
Officer. The Compliance Officer shall report the conflict of interest to the
Board and shall ensure that the conflict of interest is recorded in the Board
meeting minutes.
</P>
<P>
C.    Corporate Opportunities
</P>
<P>
General Prohibition. Insiders and affiliate of Insiders must not compete
with the Company, profit or otherwise take advantage from inside information or
take business opportunities which are within the line of business conducted by
the Company or within a line of business that the Company might reasonably be
expected to enter in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this general
prohibition shall not be applicable to business opportunities outside the
Company's immediate or contiguous market area or business opportunities not set
forth in the Company's most recent business plan. In evaluating whether a
business opportunity represents a corporate opportunity of the Company, a
director or officer may rely on the Company's most current business plan.
</P>
<P>
Disclosure. In the event that an Insider or an affiliate of an Insider is
presented with or otherwise becomes aware of a corporate opportunity which is
within the line of business conducted by the Company or a line of business that
the Company might be expected to enter in the future, the director or officer
shall fully disclose both the details of the opportunity and his/her interest in
the opportunity to the Insider's supervisor and the Compliance Officer.
Thereafter the Insider shall abstain from discussion and voting on any approval
or disapproval thereof. Where it is unclear whether a business opportunity would
present a corporate opportunity to the Company based upon a review of the
business plan disclosure should be made to the entire board of directors.
</P>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage82"></A>
<P>
Recordation. A decision by the Board approving or disapproving an
Insider's dealings with a corporate opportunity presented to it by an Insider
shall be recorded in the minutes of the Board and shall reflect the nature of
the opportunity and all members who take action or abstain from taking action on
its consideration.
</P>
<P>
Further Action. If, after full disclosure, the Board elects not to take a
corporate opportunity presented to it, to the extent it does not otherwise
present a conflict of interest with his/her position, or the Board does not rule
otherwise, the Insider who presented the matter to the Board is free to pursue
the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Constructive Trust. In the event an Insider usurps a corporate opportunity
without making full disclosure and receiving approval by the Board pursuant to
the requirements of this Code, the profits or proceeds arising from such
opportunity shall be subject to a constructive trust of which the Company shall
be the beneficiary. Thereafter, upon demand by the Company, the proceeds or
profits, if any, shall be distributed to the Company.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
D. Insider Transactions
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Disclosure. Insiders shall disclose all conflicts of interest they may
have with regard to any contract or other business arrangement to be entered
into by the Company. Contracts or other business arrangements between the
Company and an Insider or between the Company and an affiliate of an Insider,
shall be presented by the Compliance Officer to the Board for approval only
after full disclosure of the conflict of interest by the Insider who shall
thereafter recuse himself/herself from the decision making process and abstain
from voting on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Recordation. A decision by the Board approving or disapproving a contract
or other business arrangement with an Insider or affiliate of an Insider or
where an Insider otherwise has a financial interest, shall be recorded in the
minutes of the Board which shall reflect the nature of the contract or other
arrangement and all members who take action or abstain from taking action on its
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Terms. Any contract or business arrangement entered into by the Company
with an Insider or affiliate of an Insider shall be on such terms and conditions
and at such costs as would be reasonable under the facts and circumstances if
entered into with an unrelated third party.
</P>
<P>
Compliance with Law. All contracts or other business arrangements with any
Insider or affiliates of Insiders in which the Insiders have a personal or
financial interest, shall comply with any applicable statutes, rules or
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Payment of Fees. In paying any management or other fees to Insiders, the
following criteria should be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
1.    Management fees and other fees paid by the Company shall have a
direct relationship to and be based solely upon the fair market
value of the goods received or services rendered.
</P>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage83"></A>
<P>
2.    Fees shall be paid only for goods which meet the legitimate needs of
the Company and which are actually rendered.
</P>
<P>
3.    Fees shall take into consideration the qualifications of the
individual(s) providing services.
</P>
<P>
4.    Reasonable fees may be based upon cost, cost plus a reasonable
profit or current fair market value of the services rendered and may
take reasonable overhead costs into consideration.
</P>
<P>
5.    No prepayment of fees for services shall be made.
</P>
<P>
Competitive Bids. When a contract or other business arrangement for the
provision of services or delivery of goods to the Company is considered, the
Company should make every reasonable attempt to obtain competitive bids for such
contract or arrangement. In the event an Insider has a personal or business
interest in the contract or other arrangement, he or she shall recuse himself
from any discussion of the competitive bid process and shall not have access to
any documents relating to the decision-making process or the bids themselves.
</P>
<P>
Documentation for Competitive Bids. All performance of any contract or
other business arrangement shall be documented and the documents shall be
retained by the Company for a reasonable period of time. Such documentation
shall include but not be limited to: the bids; evidence of payment; documents
reflecting the actual delivery of goods or performance of services contracted
for; and documents evidencing the review of the performance of the contract or
other business arrangements by the appropriate officer(s) or the Board.
</P>
<P>
E.    Acceptance of Gifts and Other Gratuities
</P>
<P>
General. Insiders are prohibited from (a) soliciting for themselves or a
third party (other than the Company) anything of value from anyone in return for
any business, service or confidential information of the Company; or (b)
accepting anything of value (other than salary, wages, fees or other usual
compensation) from anyone in connection with the business of the Company, either
prior to or after a transaction.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions. Exceptions to the general prohibition regarding acceptance of
things of value in connection with the Company's business may include the
acceptance of:
</P>
<P>
1.    gifts, gratuities, amenities or favors based on obvious family or
personal relationships (such as those with the parents, children or
spouse of a Company official) where the circumstances make it clear
that it is those relationships rather than the business of the
Company, which are the motivating factors;
</P>
<P>
2.    meals, refreshments entertainment, accommodations or travel
arrangements, all of reasonable value, during the course of a
meeting or other occasion, the purpose of which is to hold bona fide
business discussions or to foster better business relations,
provided that the expense would be paid for by the Company as a
reasonable business expense, if not paid for by another party;
</P>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage84"></A>
<P>
3.    loans from other banks or financial institutions on customary terms
to finance proper and usual activities of the directors or officers
or employees, except where prohibited by law;
</P>
<P>
4.    advertising or promotional material of reasonable value, such as
pens, pencils, note pads, key chains, calendars and similar items;
</P>
<P>
5.    discounts or rebates on merchandise or services that do not exceed
those available to other customers;
</P>
<P>
6.    gifts of a value $35.00 or less that are related to commonly
recognized events or occasions, such as a promotion, new job,
wedding, retirement, Christmas or bat or bar mitzvah; or
</P>
<P>
7.    civic, charitable, educational, religious organizational awards for
recognition service and accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
Notification and Approval. In the event an Insider is offered anything of
value from anyone in return for any business, service or confidential
information of the Company and the item of value is not clearly subject to the
exceptions described above, the Insider should report it immediately to his or
her supervisor or to the Compliance Officer.
</P>
<P>
VI.   TRADE SECRETS
</P>
<P>
Each Insider hereby acknowledges that the term &quot;confidential information,
trade secrets, and property&quot; and all variations of that term used herein,
includes without limitation, current and prospective client and customer lists,
information with respect to client and customer accounts, requirements and
practices, sales methods and ideas, employee lists and employment data,
documents, books, records, data, materials, supplies, contract forms and other
information relating to the Company, its employees, and its products, services,
and operations, regardless of whether similar to the foregoing, and regardless
of whether conceived by the Insider.
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized Use Prohibited. Each Insider agrees that he/she shall not, at
any time (i) during the term of his/her tenure or employment or (ii) after the
termination thereof, disclose, use, or threaten to use, other than in the
performance of their duties for the Company, any confidential information, trade
secrets, or property of the Company, regardless of whether acquired or conceived
by the Insider. Insider hereby acknowledges that such confidential information,
trade secrets, and property are secret, confidential, and unique, that they
constitute the exclusive property of the Company, that such confidential
information, trade secrets and property will be made known to the Insider in
confidence in connection with their professional duties, and that any use of
such confidential information, trade secrets or property by him/her other than
for the sole benefit of the Company would be wrongful and would cause
irreparable harm.
</P>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage85"></A>
<P>
Solicitation of Clients. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
two paragraphs, but rather to implement their provisions, each Insider agrees
that, during the 12-month period commencing with the date of termination of the
Insider's tenure and/or employment, he/she will not, without the prior express
written consent of the Company in each instance, directly or indirectly, for the
Insider alone or for any affiliate of an Insider, call upon, solicit, or cause
to be solicited any person or organization that was a client of the Company
within the 12-month period ending on the effective date of his/her termination
of association or employment, if the business in which the Insider is engaged in
any way involves products or services directly competitive with those sold,
supplied or performed by the Company at the time of termination of the Insider's
association with the Company.
</P>
<P>
Association with Others Possessing Confidential Information. Each Insider
further agrees that, during the 12-month period commencing with the date of
termination of their employment/association with the Company, they will not,
without the prior express written consent of the Company, directly or
indirectly, employ, offer to employ, be employed with, or otherwise participate
in business with any person who is or had been a director, officer, or employee
of, or consultant to, the Company in any capacity at any time within the
12-month period ending on the date that Insider's employment or association with
the Company was terminated, if such other person possesses knowledge of the
confidential information of the Company that may be used in connection with such
business or employment.
</P>
<P>
Return of Confidential Documents. Upon termination of the Insider's
association or employment with the Company, he/she agrees to deliver promptly to
the Company all books, records, samples, business plans, manuals, blank forms,
documents, letters, notes, notebooks, reports, data and all copies of the
foregoing and all other confidential information, trade secrets and property of
the Company, including, without limitation, all documents that, in whole or in
part, contain any trade secrets or confidential information of the Company that
are in his/her possession or under his/her control, and the Insider shall not
retain any such materials or copies thereof without the prior express written
consent of the Company.
</P>
<P>
VII.  REPORTING ILLEGAL OR UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR
</P>
<P>
The Company strives to maintain sound and ethical business practices and
holds all Insiders to high ethical standards. In order to maintain these
standards, Insiders have an affirmative obligation to report to the Insider's
supervisor, if appropriate, or the Compliance Officer a violation of any laws,
regulations or provisions of this Code by any Insider. If an Insider is ever
uncertain of the best course of action in a specific situation, Insiders should
seek immediately clarification and help from their supervisor or the Compliance
Officer.
</P>
<P>
The Company will not tolerate any attempt by anyone to retaliate against
an Insider who, while acting in good faith pursuant to this Code, reports
illegal or unethical behavior by any employee, director, officer or third party
advisor to the Company. Thus, no Insider may be discharged, demoted, suspended,
or in any manner threatened, harassed or discriminated against for providing
information about violations of the law or this Code, or assisting in the
investigation of a violation of the law or this Code, or participating in
bringing or bringing a lawsuit.
</P>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage86"></A>
<P>
VIII. BREACHES OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR
</P>
<P>
If any Insider breaches any of the provisions of this Code, such breach
shall be reported to the Insider's supervisor, the Compliance Officer, the chief
executive officer and the Board. The Compliance Officer and the Board shall
review, or designate a committee to review, the facts and circumstances of the
breach of this Code and shall determine the appropriate remedy including
immediate termination for cause of the Insider who breached this Code.
