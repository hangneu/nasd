	Adjusted net revenue is calculated by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue and adding back compensation to employees and related taxes.
	Adjusted net revenue is a key measure used by management to observe our operational profitability since it reflects our portion of the revenue net of fees that we pass through, primarily to our agents. In addition, under IFRS, most types of fees are
	presented on a gross basis whereas certain types of fees are presented on a net basis. Therefore, in order to analyze our two sources of payment processing fees on a comparative basis, management reviews adjusted net revenue in addition to gross
	revenue. We add back compensation to employees and related taxes because, although they are an essential part of our distribution network, these expenses are not directly linked to payment volume. Nevertheless, compensation to employees and related
	taxes represents an important portion of our operating costs and affects liquidity and financial performance.

	impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates), the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense), non-cash charges (affecting share-based payments expenses), and certain one-time income
	expenses (affecting other income, offering expenses, gain on bargain purchase, gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries and income from depository).&nbsp;Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other expenses, share in losses of associates and impairment of
	investment in associates because we believe it is helpful to view the performance of our business excluding the impact of entities that we do not control, and because our share of the net income (loss) of the associate and other expenses includes
	items that have other been excluded from adjusted EBITDA (such as finance expenses, net, tax on income and depreciation and amortization). In addition, adjusted EBITDA excludes the non-cash impact of loss from discontinued operations and corporate
	costs allocated to discontinued operations because we do not believe these items reflect the underlying performance of our business. Because adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis, we
	also use adjusted EBITDA in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.

	Adjusted net profit
	is defined as net profit excluding loss from discontinued operations (net of tax), corporate costs allocated to discontinued operations, amortization of fair value adjustments, gain on bargain purchase, gains (loss) on disposals of subsidiaries,
	share-based payment expenses, offering expenses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in the business combinations, income from depositary, foreign exchange gain on June 2014 offering proceeds and the effects of taxation on those
	excluded items. Adjusted net profit is a key measure used by management to observe the operational profitability of the company. We believe adjusted net profit is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is widely
	used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties to measure a company&#146;s operating performance without the effect of non-recurring items or items that are not core to our operations. For example, loss from discontinued
	operations, corporate costs allocated to discontinued operations, gain on bargain purchase, gains on disposals, the effects of deferred taxation on excluded items and offering expenses do not represent the core operations of the business, and
	amortization of fair value adjustments and share-based payments expenses do not have a substantial cash effect. Nevertheless, such gains and losses can affect our financial performance.

	The payment services industry is highly competitive, and our continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively. In
	the countries in which we operate, we face competition from a variety of financial and non-financial business groups. These competitors include retail banks, non-traditional payment service providers (such as retailers and mobile network operators,
	or MNOs), traditional kiosk and terminal operators and electronic payment system operators, as well as other companies which provide various forms of payment services, including electronic payment and payment processing services. Competitors in our
	industry seek to differentiate themselves by features and functionalities such as speed, convenience, network size, accessibility, hours of operation, reliability and price. A significant number of our competitors have greater financial,
	technological and marketing resources than we have, operate robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In Russia, we face
	significant competition from major retail banks for our services. Our primary competitors include Sberbank, Russia&#146;s largest retail bank that is majority-owned by the Russian state, and Alfa-Bank, one of the leading privately owned Russian
	retail banks, both of which have electronic banking systems and large retail networks. Some retail banks are currently developing their own networks of kiosks and terminals and various electronic payment products. Sberbank, for example, has stated
	that its strategic goals include the promotion of alternative banking channels, such as kiosks, internet banking and mobile banking, and actively develops its online payment services capabilities, including through Yandex.Money, a major electronic
	payment system operator in Russia. Sberbank has access to significant financial resources and an extensive nationwide network of branches that can serve as a platform for the expansion of its kiosk business. Sberbank is the largest processor of
	utility bill payments, which constitute a very significant portion of overall consumer spending in our industry. These factors may give Sberbank a substantial competitive advantage over us if it pursues its strategy of establishing a broad kiosk
	network, internet banking and mobile banking businesses.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our competitors also include the Russian Federal State Unitary Enterprise Postal
	Service, or Russian Post, which offers certain payment services. Russian Post&#146;s geographical penetration is more dispersed than our physical distribution network (i.e. our kiosks and terminals). For instance, in December 2015, it was reported
	that the Russian Post acquired a bank to boost its services offering. As a state-sponsored institution, we believe that it is able to provide payment services at significantly lower prices than we are able to match profitably. If any of our
	competitors with a broad network of branches, including Sberbank, Alfa-Bank or Russian Post, were to establish or actively pursue a kiosk and terminal business, we would lose many of our consumers and our margins could be harmed. The geographical
	footprint of some of our competitors could also be leveraged by them to gain or increase a market share in the money transfers business. We also face competition from non-traditional payment service providers that have substantial financial
	resources, such as major telecommunication and small electronics retailers, including Euroset and Svyaznoy, online retailers such as Alibaba, as well as MNOs, in particular the Russian &#147;Big Three&#148; MNOs, MegaFon, VimpelCom and MTS. We also
	compete against some directly comparable businesses, such as traditional kiosk and terminal operators, including Cyberplat, Compay and Elecsnet, and electronic payment system operators (primarily Yandex.Money and WebMoney). New competitors may

	payments service Apple Pay in September 2014). In 2013, PayPal obtained a Non-Banking Credit Institution license from the CBR in order to conduct business in Russia, which enabled its customers to effect transactions in Russian rubles. In November
	2013, Russia&#146;s premier online bank Tinkoff Credit Systems announced the launch of its own electronic wallet system, called Tinkoff Mobile Wallet. In November 2014, the state-owned telecommunications company Rostelekom announced its plans to
	create its own payment system. Additionally, some of our competitors are currently our major merchants (the Big Three MNOs) or our large agents (for example, Svyaznoy). If we are unable to compete successfully for consumers, agents and merchants,
	our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

	One of the key measures we use to assess our financial performance is our average net revenue yield, which we calculate by
	dividing adjusted net revenue by the total payment volume of the transactions we process. Our average net revenue yield may be affected by a number of factors, including increased competition, pressure from merchants and/or agents, and acquisitions.
	We have experienced declines in our average net revenue yield for certain merchant categories in the past, in particular for our Telecom merchants where the merchant fees were sharply reduced by the Big Three MNOs, who have been seeking to reduce
	costs, and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, in 2015, our average net revenue yield declined following the acquisition of the Contact money transfer system (&#147;Contact&#148;) and the Rapida payment processing system
	(&#147;Rapida&#148;) businesses, both of which had been operating with a significantly lower average net revenue yield than QIWI (excluding Contact and Rapida) during 2015. In order to maintain our competitiveness, we must continue to ensure that
	our payment processing system provides a more convenient and attractive option for both merchants and customers than alternative systems that may not require payment of a processing fee. Retail banks and various payment service providers are
	constantly developing low to zero-commission payment channels for their consumers. To attract consumers, we also offer certain services on a commission-free basis, such as peer-to-peer transfers within Visa Qiwi Wallet and certain payments in
	e-commerce. Despite our efforts, consumers may still choose to use other payment systems, even if those systems do not offer the convenience that we do, because they charge lower fees. In addition, because agents are able to switch between different
	payment processing systems, we may face additional pressure to reduce the fees we charge due to increased competition from other payment service providers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result, if average net revenue yields continue to decline, we must offset the financial impact of such decline by increasing our payment
	volume or through the development and enhancement of value added services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our payment volumes or that any value added services we introduce will be profitable. If we are unable to offset the
	decline in our average net revenue yield resulting from this and other factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

	In addition, the Contact and Rapida businesses have historically operated with a significantly lower average net revenue yield than us. As a
	part of our strategy, we are seeking to increase the average net revenue yields of the Contact and Rapida businesses, for instance, through the renegotiation of legacy merchant contracts. If we are not able to increase the average net revenue yield
	of Contact and Rapida, our future growth may be materially and adversely affected.

	The payment services industry depends heavily on the overall
	level of consumer spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits. Economic factors such as employment levels,
	business conditions, energy and fuel costs, interest rates, inflation rate and the strength of the ruble against foreign currencies (in particular the U.S. dollar) could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. A reduction in
	the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenue and profits. If our merchants make fewer sales of their products and services using our services or consumers spend less money per transaction, we will have fewer transactions
	to process at lower amounts, resulting in lower revenue. A further weakening in the economy could have a negative impact on our merchants, as well as consumers who purchase products and services using our payment processing systems, which could, in
	turn, negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the recessionary environment disproportionately affects some of the market segments that represent a larger portion of our payment processing
	volume. In addition, these factors could force some of our merchants and/or agents to liquidate their operations or go bankrupt, or could cause our agents to reduce the number of their locations or hours of operation, resulting in reduced
	transaction volumes. We also have a certain amount of fixed costs, including salaries and rent, which could limit our ability to adjust costs and respond quickly to changes affecting the economy and our business.

	Russia&#146;s economy has been facing significant challenges for the past few years due to the combined effect of the ongoing crisis in
	Eastern Ukraine and Syria, the economic and financial sanctions imposed in connection with it on certain Russian companies and individuals, as well as against entire sectors of Russian economy, by the U.S., EU, Canada and other countries, a steep
	decline in oil prices, a record weakening of the Russian ruble against the U.S.&nbsp;dollar, a lack of access to financing for Russian issuers, capital flight and a general climate of political and economic uncertainty. See &#147;&#150; Economic
	instability in Russia could have an adverse effect on our business&#148; and &#147;&#150; The situation in Ukraine and the U.S., EU and other sanctions that have been imposed could adversely impact our operations and financial condition&#148;. The
	Russian economy contracted in 2015 and is expected to continue to contract in 2016. At the same time, the population&#146;s purchasing power is decreasing due to the weakening of the ruble, basic necessities such as food products and utilities are
	becoming more expensive, and consumer confidence is declining, according to the Russian Consumer Confidence Overall Index reported by Rosstat. According to Rosstat, inflation was 11.4% in 2014 and 12.9% in 2015, while real average wages have been
	declining (with Rosstat&#146;s preliminary data for 2015 indicating that the population&#146;s real disposable income contracted by 4% in 2015 as compared to 2014). Against this backdrop, household consumption decreased by 10.1% in 2015, according
	to the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. A prolonged economic slowdown in Russia could have a significant negative effect on consumer spending in Russia and, accordingly, on our business. As a result of the
	challenging operating environment in Russia, we have experienced slower payment volume growth in certain of our payment categories and payment volume decline in certain others, in particular in Financial Services, which has been impacted by several
	factors including low consumer loan approval rates and lack of refinancing options available to consumers, the revocation of licenses of several large banks and a decrease in real disposable income. The current financial crisis in Russia is still
	ongoing. Our loan repayment and money remittance volumes, and to a lesser degree our e-commerce payments volumes, have been particularly affected, due to a shrinking banking sector, increasing unemployment and cautious consumer spending. Moreover,
	loan repayment volumes and our corresponding revenue from financial services

	Our agents pay us an agreed fee using a portion of the fees levied by them on consumers. The fee paid to us by the agent is based on a
	percentage of the value of each transaction that we process. However, in certain cases the amount of fees levied by an agent on a consumer for each particular transaction is determined by such agent at its own discretion. We do not cap the amount of
	such fees or otherwise control it. We believe that the fees set by our agents are market-driven, and that our interests and our agents&#146; interests are aligned with a view to maintaining fees at a level that would simultaneously result in our
	agents&#146; profitability and customer satisfaction. However, we can provide no assurance that our agents will not raise fees to a level that will adversely affect the popularity of our products among consumers. At the same time, if we are forced
	to cap customer fees to protect the strength of our brand or otherwise, we may lose a significant number of agents, which would reduce the penetration of our physical distribution network. In limited instances, we have introduced such caps at the
	request of our merchants. No assurance can be made that this trend will not increase. Material increases in customer fees by our agents or the imposition of caps on the rates of such fees by us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial

	likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim statements will not be prevented or detected.&#148; In connection with their audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011, our independent

	Substantially all of our business is in emerging markets, including Russia and

	Our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect our industry, the number of which has increased significantly in recent years. We
	are subject to a variety of regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and financing criminal activity and terrorism, financial services regulations, payment services regulations, consumer protection laws, currency control regulations,
	advertising laws and privacy and data protection laws and therefore experience periodic investigations by various regulatory authorities in connection with the same, which may sometimes result in monetary or other sanctions being imposed on us.
	Further, these laws and regulations vary significantly from country to country. Many of these laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and are often unclear and inconsistent with other applicable laws and regulations, including across various
	jurisdictions, making compliance challenging and increasing our related operating costs and legal risks. In particular, there has been increased public attention and heightened legislation and regulations regarding money laundering and terrorist
	financing. We sometimes have to make significant judgment calls in applying anti-money laundering legislation and risk being found in non-compliance with it, particularly in relation to its mandatory client identification requirements, if, for
	example, we process payments made by our consumers from their Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts for amounts in excess of the thresholds imposed by anti-money laundering legislation without the required client identification. Although we use all methods
	available for client identification and are in compliance with market practice (see &#147;&#151;Know-your-client requirements established by Russian anti-money laundering legislation may adversely impact our transaction volumes&#148;) the Russian
	regulators may view us as being non-compliant and impose fines and other sanctions on us.

	If local authorities in Russia, Kazakhstan or

	In the end of 2014, we became subject to
	financial monitoring legislation in Kazakhstan, imposing certain client identification requirements on us. In connection with such legislation, we had to restructure our operations in Kazakhstan to make our Kazakh subsidiary, instead of a Russian
	one, the operator of our payment system in the country which we completed in September 2015. As the anti-money laundering legislation in Kazakhstan is relatively nascent and undeveloped, we face various difficulties while applying it. Currently we
	and other participants of electronic money market in Kazakhstan cooperate with the local authorities in order to clarify the existing legislative gaps to ensure proper functioning of anti-money laundering procedures in Kazakhstan. However, if we are
	not able to do so or if we are not able to comply with the new legislation for any other reason, we could become subject to regulatory action in Kazakhstan and could face fines or significant restrictions on our business operations in the country.
	In addition, there is a draft law under consideration of the Kazakh legislature that seeks to introduce a more comprehensive regulatory regime for the payments market in general. This draft law, if adopted in its current form, would confer certain
	additional compliance, reporting and other obligations and liabilities upon certain of our subsidiaries. We are currently continuing to assess the potential impact of this new legislation on our business. Since such legislation is nascent and little
	tested in practice, we may become subject to fines and other penalties if the measures we undertake in response are viewed as insufficient by the relevant regulators.

	In some jurisdictions where we operate, there is currently little or virtually no legislation addressing electronic payments, and no assurance
	can be made that if such legislation is adopted it will be beneficial to our business. For instance, if a statutory cap is imposed on the fees that can be charged to the consumers using our kiosks and terminals, it could significantly reduce our
	margins. From time to time, proposals are submitted to the Russian State Duma to cap the amount of such fees.

	Furthermore, there can also
	be no assurance that the mandatory client identification requirements under the anti-money laundering legislation will not change further in a manner adverse to our business, for example, through making the identification process more burdensome or
	through lowering the thresholds for transactions which non-identified customers or customers that only underwent the simplified identification process can perform (see &#147;Regulation&#148;), which could result in lower payment volumes for us.

	Currently all transactions with the use of cards issued under international brands, such as Visa and MasterCard, are processed through the
	facilities of the Russian national payment card system rather than the international payment systems&#146; own facilities. While not directly applicable to us, these developments have complicated the operations of international payment systems in
	Russia, and could potentially have broader detrimental consequences for the Russian financial system, which are difficult to evaluate at this stage. While both Visa and MasterCard are continuing to operate in Russia within the framework of the new
	legislation, there can be no assurance how situation will further develop. If Visa ceases to operate in Russia, we may be unable to issue Visa-branded prepaid cards or continue to operate under the &#147;Visa Qiwi Wallet&#148; brand, and thereby
	lose the possible benefits of association with the Visa brand. This could lower consumer confidence with our products and could reduce the number of transactions made though Visa Qiwi Wallet, which could have a material adverse effect on our Visa
	Qiwi Wallet business and our business as a whole. It could also render us unable to realize our international expansion plans associated with our partnership with Visa. Additionally, these developments have caused international payment systems to
	start increasing their fees for Russian banks to protect their margins.

	Changes in our industry are rapid, and new products that we
	develop may become subject to government regulation undoing the benefits we expect to derive from such products. Recently we started developing a new cryptocurrency &#147;bitruble&#148; on the basis of the blockchain technology used for bitcoins. We
	have been working with Russian regulators to ensure that we will be able to launch this product in full compliance with Russian law. However, given that prohibition of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies in Russia is being actively called for by a
	number of government officials, no assurance can be given that such launch will eventually take place, or that this product would not become prohibited after the launch, in which case we would have to cease its operations. This would result in a
	loss of our investment in this project and potentially damage our reputation as a result of being involved with a product that became illegal.

	Potential future acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures may pose

	or cost savings may not materialize, resulting in lower than expected benefits to us from such transactions. We may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue. Additionally, when making acquisitions it may not be possible for
	us to conduct a detailed investigation of the nature of the assets being acquired due to, for instance, time constraints in making the decision and other factors. We may become responsible for additional liabilities or obligations not foreseen at
	the time of an acquisition. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, we must comply with various antitrust requirements. It is possible that perceived or actual violations of these requirements could give rise to regulatory enforcement
	action or result in us not receiving all necessary approvals in order to complete a desired acquisition. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves, and to the extent the purchase price is
	paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. To the extent we pay the purchase price with proceeds from the incurrence of debt, it would increase our level of indebtedness and could negatively affect our liquidity and restrict our

	In recent years, the CBR has
	considerably increased the intensity of its supervision and regulation of the Russian banking sector. Historically, the revocation of banking licenses by the CBR has been a relatively rare event mostly occurring to local banks with little assets and
	little or no significance for the banking sector as a whole. Starting October 2013, however, the CBR has launched a campaign aimed at cleansing the Russian banking industry, revoking the licenses from an unusually high number of banks (including
	significant banks such as Master-Bank, Investbank, ProBusinessBank, Svyaznoy Bank, Vneshprombank and others) on allegations of money laundering, financial statements manipulation and other illegal activities, as well as inability of certain banks to
	discharge their financial obligations. These measures resulted in turmoil in the banking industry, instigated bank runs on a number of Russian credit institutions, and severely undermined the trust that the Russian population had with private banks.
	In addition to putting increasing regulatory pressure on Qiwi Bank and Rapida LTD, this change in policy by the CBR has also impacted, and we expect may continue to impact, our business in a number of other ways, including reduced spending by the
	banks on advertising and a decrease in consumer lending, resulting in less loan repayments through our network and therefore reduced fees. As a result of a general decrease in banking activity, among other factors, Russia may continue to experience
	less robust consumer spending, which could also result in the reduction of our payment processing fees. In addition, these factors could further tighten liquidity on the Russian market and add pressure onto the ruble. All of these factors could
	materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	entity under much more stringent scrutiny from the Competition Protection Agency, therefore increasing the probability of being investigated and penalized if a violation occurs. As a result, the Competition Protection Agency may impose restrictions

	intellectual capital needs. This is particularly true with respect to qualified and experienced software engineers and IT staff, who are highly sought after and are not in sufficient supply in Russia and in most other markets in which we operate.
	The market for such personnel is highly competitive, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to replace effectively current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. It may also be difficult for us to
	obtain necessary qualified personnel with local experience to support our international growth, which may jeopardize our ongoing and planned expansion into new geographies. Our efforts to retain and develop personnel may result in significant
	additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect
	on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	In response to the Ukraine crisis, the European Union and the United States (as well as other countries such as Norway, Canada and Australia)
	have passed a variety of economic sanctions against Russia. One form these sanctions have taken is to identify certain persons as &#145;designated nationals&#146; with the basic practical consequences that U.S. persons cannot do business with them
	while EU persons cannot provide funds or other economic resources to them, their assets in the EU and United States are subject to seizure and in the case of individuals they can be subject to travel bans. A number of Russian government officials,
	businessmen, banks and companies have been so designated. Another form these sanctions have taken, with greater consequence for the Russian economy, is &#145;sectoral&#146; sanctions with the basic consequence that several of Russia&#146;s leading
	banks &#150; including Gazprombank, Vnesheconombank, Bank of Moscow, Russian Agricultural Bank, VTB Bank, and Sberbank &#150; cannot access Western capital (as EU and U.S. persons are prohibited from extending them debt financing in excess of 30
	days or dealing in their new equity issuances and providing related services); similar sectoral sanctions have been applied against several prominent Russian oil and gas and defense companies. Other Western sanctions have been imposed in respect of,
	among other things, Russian military defense entities, dual use technologies, sophisticated off-shore oil drilling technologies and doing business in Crimea. While the current sanctions do not target us or the payments industry more generally, these
	sanctions have had and may continue to have the effect of damaging the Russian economy by, among other things, accelerating capital flight from Russia, weakening of the Russian ruble, exacerbating the negative investor sentiment towards Russia and
	making it harder for Russian companies to access international financial markets for debt and equity financing. In addition, a number of Western businesses have curtailed or suspended activities in Russia or dealings with Russian counterparts for
	reputational reasons even though currently neither such activities nor dealings with their relevant Russian counterparts were proscribed by the sanctions. An expansion of the existing or introduction of new sanctions, including those mentioned
	above, or sanctions specifically targeting us or our&nbsp;management or shareholders, or our sector generally, could result in our international customers, suppliers, shareholders and other business partners revising their relationship with us for
	compliance, political, reputational or other reasons, which could affect our business.

	of consumers based on their level of identification, being anonymous, identified through a simplified procedure and fully identified. The consumers who have not undergone any identification procedure are qualified as anonymous and are not allowed to
	contemplate transactions in excess of RUB15,000 as well as hold an electronic money account balance in excess of RUB15,000. The consumers who have undergone simplified identification procedure with the payment services provider are entitled to
	perform electronic money transactions in excess of RUB15,000 provided that at any point of time the account balance of electronic money does not exceed RUB60,000 and the total amount of transactions does not exceed RUB200,000 per month. Fully
	identified consumers are entitled to perform same type of electronic transfers as consumers identified through a simplified procedure but with increased threshold of the electronic money account balance of RUB600,000 and no limitations for the total
	transaction amount per month. The key difference between the simplified and the full identification procedures is that the simplified identification can be performed remotely. The remote identification requires the verification of certain data
	provided by consumers against public databases. Albeit a government order No.630 dated 8&nbsp;July 2014 was enacted providing that public databases shall be set up by specific government authorities and access to them shall be granted to the third
	parties authorized to carry out identification of consumers, such databases are not yet up and running at scale and, to our knowledge, there is no work in progress on setting up such databases. Thus, current situation could cause us to be in
	violation of the identification requirements. In case we are enforced not to use the simplified identification procedure until the databases are fully running, it could negatively affect the number of our consumers and, consequently, our volumes and

	Russian real
	GDP growth (period-on-period) slowed to 0.6% in 2014 and contracted by 3.7% in 2015, putting Russia in recession. 2015 was the worst year for the Russian economy since 2009, when Russian GDP fell 7.8%, according to Rosstat. Given the importance of
	the energy sector to the Russian economy, a principal reason for this downturn has been the decline of global oil prices. The price of the global benchmark Brent crude has fallen from U.S.$55/bbl on December&nbsp;31, 2014 to U.S. $37.28/bbl on
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, and is widely predicted not to significantly recover for some time to come. The international sanctions arising from the Ukraine crisis have also undercut confidence in the Russian economy and added to the cost of capital.
	The lack of confidence in the Russian economy led to a run on the ruble in late 2014 and further weakening in 2015: the average ruble/U.S. dollar exchange rate was RUB36.18/$1 for the third quarter of 2014, RUB46.96/$1 for the fourth quarter of
	2014, RUB62.16/$1 for the first quarter of 2015, RUB52.63/$1 for the second quarter of 2015, RUB62.85/$1 for the third quarter of 2015 and RUB65.86/$1 for the fourth quarter of 2015, according to the CBR. This has been accompanied by rising
	inflation and a declining trend in real average wages. According to Rosstat, inflation was 11.4% in 2014 and 12.9% in 2015, while real average wages have been declining (with Rosstat&#146;s preliminary data for 2015 indicating that the
	population&#146;s real disposable income contracted by 4% in 2015 as compared to 2014). Against this backdrop, household consumption decreased by 10.1% in 2015, according to the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public
	Administration. Another indicator of lack of confidence in the Russian economy is capital flight, which was U.S.$56.9 billion in 2015, U.S.$153.0 billion in 2014 and U.S.$63.0 billion in 2013. There are concerns that the Russian government may seek
	to increase the tax burden of Russian companies or become stricter in its enforcement of existing tax legislation in the light of the shrinking state income due to decline in oil prices. The weakening of the Russian economy and the deterioration of
	Government finances (which rely significantly on taxes on oil revenues) has also led to international rating agencies to lower the Russian Federation credit ratings. Credit ratings for a number of Russian companies and banks have been lowered in the
	past months, another factor contributing to an increased cost of capital in the Russian economy.

	As Russia produces and exports large quantities of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and
	other commodities, the Russian economy is particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in oil and gas prices as well as other commodities prices, which historically have been subject to significant volatility over time, as illustrated by the recent
	decline in crude oil prices. Russian banks, and the Russian economy generally, were adversely affected by the global financial crisis. The Russian economy has fallen into a recession in 2015. There can be no assurance that any measures adopted by
	the Russian government to mitigate the effect of any financial and economic crisis will result in a sustainable recovery of the Russian economy. Current macroeconomic challenges, low or negative economic growth in the United States, China, Japan

	The banking and other financial systems in Russia are not well-developed or regulated, and Russian legislation relating to banks and bank
	accounts is subject to varying interpretation and inconsistent application. The 1998 financial crisis resulted in the bankruptcy and liquidation of many Russian banks and almost entirely eliminated the developing market for commercial bank loans at
	that time. From April to July 2004, the Russian banking sector experienced further serious turmoil. As a result of various market rumors and certain regulatory and liquidity problems, several privately owned Russian banks experienced liquidity
	problems and were unable to attract funds on the inter-bank market or from their client base. Simultaneously, they faced large withdrawals of deposits by both retail and corporate customers. Several of these privately owned Russian banks collapsed
	or ceased or severely limited their operations. Russian banks owned or controlled by the government and foreign owned banks generally were not adversely affected by the turmoil.

	There are currently a limited number of creditworthy Russian banks (most of which are headquartered in Moscow). Although the CBR has the
	mandate and authority to suspend banking licenses of insolvent banks, many insolvent banks still operate. Many Russian banks also do not meet international banking standards, and the transparency of the Russian banking sector in some respects still
	lags behind internationally accepted norms. Banking supervision is also often inadequate, as a result of which many banks do not follow existing CBR regulations with respect to lending criteria, credit quality, loan loss reserves, diversification of
	exposure or other requirements. The imposition of more stringent regulations or interpretations could lead to weakened capital adequacy and the insolvency of some banks. Prior to the onset of the 2008 global economic crisis, there had been a rapid
	increase in lending by Russian banks, which many believe had been accompanied by a deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio of those banks. In addition, a robust domestic corporate debt market was leading Russian banks to hold
	increasingly large amounts of Russian corporate ruble bonds in their portfolios, which further deteriorated the risk profile of the assets of Russian banks. The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 has led to the collapse or bailout of some Russian
	banks and to significant liquidity constraints for others. Profitability levels of most Russian banks have been adversely affected. Indeed, the global crisis has prompted the government to inject substantial funds into the banking system amid
	reports of difficulties among Russian banks and other financial institutions.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In recent years, the CBR has considerably increased the
	intensity of its supervision and regulation of the Russian banking sector. Historically, the revocation of banking licenses by the CBR has been a relatively rare event mostly occurring to local banks with little assets and little or no significance
	for the banking sector as a whole. Starting October 2013, however, the CBR has launched a campaign aimed at cleansing the Russian banking industry, revoking the licenses from an unusually high number of banks (including significant banks such as
	Master-Bank, Investbank, ProBusinessBank, Svyaznoy Bank, Vneshprombank and others) on allegations of money laundering, financial statements manipulation and other illegal activities, as well as inability of certain banks to discharge their financial
	obligations, which resulted in turmoil in the industry, instigated bank runs on a number of Russian credit institutions, and severely undermined the trust that the Russian population had with private banks. It could be expected that the difficulties
	currently faced by the Russian economy could result in further collapses of Russian banks, particularly those heavily exposed to the retail lending sector, as non-performing consumer loans have increased significantly and demand has shrunk due to
	more cautious consumer spending. According to the CBR, the level of past-due debt in the Russian banking sector has increased from 3.5% as of January&nbsp;1, 2014 to 5.2% as of August&nbsp;1, 2015. The CBR&#146;s December 2014 RUB 127 billion
	bail-out of Trust Bank, Russia&#146;s 22nd largest bank by assets, may be symptomatic of weaknesses in the Russian banking sector. With few exceptions (notably the state-owned banks), the Russian banking system suffers from weak depositor
	confidence, high concentration of exposure to certain borrowers and their affiliates, poor credit quality of borrowers and related party transactions. Current economic circumstances in Russia are putting stress on the Russian banking system.
	Combined with heightened interest rates &#150; with the key interest rate of the CBR currently at 11%&nbsp;per annum (and rising as high as 17% over the course of 2014-2015) &#150; these circumstances decrease the affordability of consumer credit,
	putting further pressure on overall consumer purchasing power.

	As a substantial portion of our expenses (including operating costs and capital expenditures) are denominated in rubles, the relative movement

	The Russian judicial system is not immune from economic and political influences. The Russian court system is understaffed and underfunded,
	and the quality of justice, duration of legal proceedings, and performance of courts and enforcement of judgments remain problematic. Under Russian legislation, judicial precedents generally have no binding effect on subsequent decisions and are not
	recognized as a source of law. However, in practice, courts usually consider judicial precedents in their decisions. Enforcement of court judgments can in practice be very difficult and time-consuming in Russia. Additionally, court claims are

	sections of the Russian Tax Code relating to the aforementioned taxes are comparatively new, interpretation of these regulations is often unclear or non-existent. Also, different interpretations
	of tax regulations exist both among and within government bodies at the federal, regional and local levels, which creates uncertainties and inconsistent enforcement. The current practice is that private clarifications to specific taxpayers&#146;
	queries with respect to particular situations issued by the Russian Ministry of Finance are not binding on the Russian tax authorities and there can be no assurance that the Russian tax authorities will not take positions contrary to those set out
	in such clarifications. During the past several years the Russian tax authorities have shown a tendency to take more assertive positions in their interpretation of the tax legislation, which has led to an increased number of material tax assessments
	issued by them as a result of tax audits. In practice, the Russian tax authorities generally interpret the tax laws in ways that do not favor taxpayers, who often have to resort to court proceedings against the Russian tax authorities to defend
	their position. In some instances Russian tax authorities have applied new interpretations of tax laws retroactively. There is no established precedent or consistent court practice in respect of these issues. Furthermore, in the absence of binding

	The Russian tax authorities are increasingly taking a &#147;substance over form&#148; approach. While
	certain reductions in the rates, such as for profits tax, have been effected, it is expected that Russian tax legislation will become more sophisticated. The possibility exists that the Government may introduce additional revenue-raising measures.
	Although it is unclear how such measures would operate, the introduction of any such measures may affect the Group&#146;s overall tax efficiency and may result in significant additional taxes becoming payable. There can be no assurance that the
	Russian Tax Code will not be changed in the future in a manner adverse to the stability and predictability of the tax system. These factors, together with the potential for state budget deficits, raise the risk of the imposition of additional taxes
	on us. The introduction of new taxes or amendments to current taxation rules may have a substantial impact on the overall amount of our tax liabilities. There is no assurance that we would not be required to make substantially larger tax payments in
	the future, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	In its decision No 138-0 dated July&nbsp;25, 2001, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation,
	or the Constitutional Court, introduced the concept of &#147;a taxpayer acting in a bad faith&#148; without clearly stipulating the criteria for it. Similarly, this concept is not defined in Russian tax law. Nonetheless, this concept has been used
	by the tax authorities to deny, for instance, the taxpayer&#146;s right to rely on the provisions of the tax law. The tax authorities and courts often exercise significant discretion in interpreting this concept in a manner that is unfavorable to
	taxpayers. On October&nbsp;12, 2006, the Plenum of the Higher Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation, or the Higher Arbitrazh Court, issued Ruling No.&nbsp;53, formulating the concept of an &#147;unjustified tax benefit&#148; which is defined in
	the ruling mainly by reference to specific examples of such tax benefits (e.g., tax benefits obtained as a result of a transaction that has no reasonable business purpose) which may lead to disallowance of their application. There is growing
	practice of the interpretation of this concept by the tax authorities or the courts and it is apparent that the tax authorities actively seek to apply this concept when challenging tax positions taken by taxpayers. Although the intention of Ruling
	No.&nbsp;53 was to combat the abuse of tax law, based on cases brought to courts to date relating to Ruling No.&nbsp;53, the tax authorities have started applying the &#147;unjustified tax benefit&#148; concept in a broader sense than may have been
	intended by the Higher Arbitrazh Court. In particular, we are aware of cases when this concept has been applied by the tax authorities in order to disallow benefits granted by double tax treaties. To date, in the majority of cases where this concept
	has been applied, the courts have ruled in favor of taxpayers, but it is not possible to determine whether the courts will follow these precedents in the future.

	In May 2015, a draft legislation introducing the concept of &#147;unjustified tax benefit&#148; into the Russian Tax Code passed the first
	reading in the State Duma of the Russian Federation. Subject to certain exceptions, the proposed legislation would prohibit taxpayers from deducting expenses for profits tax purposes and corresponding input VAT in cases where a business transaction
	was primarily aimed at tax avoidance, the primary documents were signed by unauthorized or unspecified persons, or the seller did not actually sell goods (work, services) or transfer any property rights. Although at the moment it is not clear how
	the final legislation will be worded it is anticipated that the introduction of these changes would allow the Russian tax authorities to have more arguments in disputes with taxpayers related to unjustified tax benefits. Currently the draft law is
	still pending amendments to be made by the State Duma of the Russian Federation. It is unclear if and when the concept of &#147;unjustified tax benefit&#148; is to be introduced into the Russian tax legislation.

	Russian transfer pricing legislation became effective in the Russian Federation on January&nbsp;1, 1999. This legislation allowed
	the tax authorities to make transfer-pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities in respect of certain types of transactions (&#147;controlled&#148; transactions). Special transfer pricing provisions were established for operations
	with securities and derivatives. However, Russian transfer pricing rules were vaguely drafted, generally leaving wide scope for interpretation by Russian tax authorities and courts. There was little guidance (although some court decisions are
	available) as to how these rules should be applied. Following the adoption of Federal Law No.&nbsp;227-FZ &#147;On amendments to certain legislative acts of the Russian Federation in connection with the improvement of pricing principles&#148; dated
	July&nbsp;18, 2011, the new transfer pricing rules became effective from January&nbsp;1, 2012. Compared to the previous Russian transfer pricing rules, the new rules are more technically elaborate and, to a certain extent, better aligned with the
	international transfer pricing principles developed by the OECD. The list of the &#147;controlled&#148; transactions under the new transfer pricing legislation includes transactions with related parties and certain types of cross border
	transactions. The amendments have toughened considerably the previous transfer pricing rules, by, among other things, effectively shifting the burden of proving market prices from the tax authorities to the taxpayer and obliging the taxpayer to keep
	specific documentation. The new rules also permit taxpayers to enter into advance pricing agreements with the tax authorities; however, it is unclear how such agreements will operate in practice. Special transfer pricing rules continue to apply to
	transactions with securities and derivatives. It is currently difficult to evaluate what effect these new provisions may have on us.

	Currently the tax authorities perform tax audits of some Russian taxpayers with major focus on compliance with new transfer pricing
	legislation. It is therefore possible that the Group entities may become subject to transfer pricing tax audits by tax authorities in the near future. Due to the uncertainty and lack of established practice of application of the new Russian transfer
	pricing legislation the Russian tax authorities may challenge the level of prices applied by the Group under the &#147;controlled&#148; transactions (including certain intercompany transactions) and accrue additional tax liabilities. If additional
	taxes are assessed with respect to these matters, they may be material.

	Further, we would not be eligible for benefits under the tax treaties entered into between Cyprus

	operate. We manage the related risks by looking at management functions and risks in various countries and level of profits allocated to each subsidiary. If additional taxes are assessed with respect to these matters, they may be material.

	The Russian Tax Code contains the concept of a permanent establishment in Russia as means for taxing foreign legal entities, which carry on
	regular entrepreneurial activities in Russia beyond preparatory and auxiliary activities. The Russian double tax treaties with other countries also contain a similar concept. If a foreign company is treated as having a permanent establishment in
	Russia, it would be subject to Russian taxation in a manner broadly similar to the taxation of a Russian legal entity, but only to the extent of the amount of the foreign company&#146;s income that is attributable to the permanent establishment in
	Russia. However, the practical application of the concept of a permanent establishment under Russian domestic law is not well developed and so foreign companies having even limited operations in Russia, which would not normally satisfy the
	conditions for creating a permanent establishment under international norms, may be at risk of being treated as having a permanent establishment in Russia and hence being exposed to Russian taxation. Furthermore, the Russian Tax Code contains
	attribution rules, which are not sufficiently developed and there is a risk that the tax authorities might seek to assess Russian tax on the global income of a foreign company. Having a permanent establishment in Russia may also lead to other
	adverse tax implications, including challenging a reduced withholding tax rate on dividends under an applicable double tax treaty, potential effect on VAT and property tax obligations. There is also a risk that penalties could be imposed by the tax
	authorities for failure to register a permanent establishment with the Russian tax authorities. Recent events in Russia suggest that the tax authorities may more actively be seeking to investigate and assert whether foreign entities of our group,
	operate through a permanent establishment in Russia. Any such taxes or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	Dividends paid by a Russian legal entity to a foreign legal entity are generally subject to Russian
	withholding income tax at a rate of 15%, although this tax rate may be reduced under an applicable double tax treaty. We intend to rely on the Russia-Cyprus double tax treaty. The tax treaty allows reduction of withholding income tax on dividends
	paid by a Russian company to a Cypriot company to 10% provided that the following conditions are met: (i)&nbsp;the Cypriot company is a tax resident of Cyprus within the meaning of the tax treaty; (ii)&nbsp;the Cypriot company is the beneficial
	owner of the dividends; (iii)&nbsp;the dividends are not attributable to a permanent establishment of the Cypriot company in Russia; and (iv)&nbsp;the treaty clearance procedures are duly performed. This rate may be further reduced to 5% if the
	direct investment of the Cypriot company in a Russian subsidiary paying the dividends is at least &#128;100,000. Although we will seek to claim treaty protection, there is a risk that the applicability of the reduced rate of 5% or 10% may be
	challenged by Russian tax authorities. As a result, there can be no assurance that we would be able to avail ourselves of the reduced withholding income tax rate in practice. Specifically, our Cypriot holding company may incur a 15% withholding
	income tax at source on dividend payments from Russian subsidiaries if the treaty clearance procedures are not duly performed at the date when the dividend payment is made. In this case we may seek to claim as a refund the difference between the 15%
	tax withheld and the reduced rate of 10% or 5% as appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that such taxes would be refunded in practice.

	Although we intend to rely on an applicable double tax treaty between Russia and the country where the relevant non-Russian subsidiary is
	resident, no assurance can be given that the reduced withholding tax rate would apply. A number of amendments had been made to the Russian tax legislation introducing, amongst others, the concept of beneficial ownership. Under this concept, double
	tax treaty benefits are only available to the recipient of income from Russian sources, if such recipient is the beneficial owner of the relevant income. Foreign entities that do not qualify as beneficial owners may not claim double tax treaty
	relief even if they are residents in a double tax treaty country. For these purposes, the beneficial owner is defined as a person holding directly, through its direct and/or indirect participation in other organizations or otherwise, the right to
	own, use or dispose of income, or the person on whose behalf another person is authorized to use and/or dispose of such income. In order to determine whether a foreign entity is a beneficial owner of income, it is necessary to take into account the
	functions performed by such foreign entity, as well as the risks borne by it. Entities are not recognized as beneficial owners of income if they have limited authorities to use or dispose income received from Russian sources, perform agency or other
	similar functions in favor of third parties, not taking any risks, or transfer such income (either partially or in full) to third parties that are not eligible to double tax treaty benefits.

	Securities Act would be available to enable U.S. holders of ADSs to exercise such pre-emptive rights and, if such exemption is available, we may not take the steps necessary to enable U.S. holders of ADSs to rely on it. Accordingly, our ADS holders
	may not be able to exercise their pre-emptive rights on future issuances of shares, and, as a result, their percentage ownership interest in us would be reduced. In April 2013, our shareholders authorized the disapplication of pre-emptive rights for
	a period of five years from May&nbsp;8, 2013, the date of the closing of our initial public offering, in connection with the issue of up to an additional 52,000,000 class B shares, including in the form of ADSs. Any issuances of class&nbsp;B shares
	for cash exceeding this amount during this five-year period would require disapplication of pre-emptive rights by the class&nbsp;B shareholders at such time. However, a Cyprus court or regulatory authority could determine that such waiver should not
	apply to an issuance of class B shares even if it is within such amount. If for any reason the disapplication of these rights proves to be ineffective or class&nbsp;B shareholders do not approve any further disapplication of pre-emptive rights that
	may be required, our ADS holders&#146; ability to participate in future issuances of class B shares, including in the form of ADSs, may be limited. Furthermore, rights offerings are difficult to implement effectively under the current U.S.

	We were incorporated in Cyprus under the name of
	OE Investments Limited on February&nbsp;26, 2007 as a new holding company for JSC QIWI (previously known as OSMP CJSC and QIWI CJSC), which was incorporated in Russia in January in 2004. In 2007, we acquired, among other entities, CJSC E-port and
	LLC Qiwi Wallet; which were reorganized into JSC QIWI. In April 2008, we launched the Qiwi brand, which gradually became the marketing name for our businesses. We changed our name to Qiwi Limited on September&nbsp;13, 2010, and subsequently to Qiwi
	plc upon converting to a public limited company on February&nbsp;25, 2013.

	We are a leading provider of next generation payment services in
	Russia and the CIS. We have an integrated proprietary network that enables payment services across physical, online and mobile channels. We have deployed over 16.1&nbsp;million virtual wallets, over 172,000 kiosks and terminals, and enabled
	merchants to accept over RUB 70 billion cash and electronic payments monthly from over 67&nbsp;million consumers using our network at least once a month (aggregating consumers across Qiwi, Contact and Rapida networks, without elimination of
	potential duplication). Our consumers can use cash, stored value and other electronic payment methods to order and pay for goods and services across physical or virtual environments interchangeably. We believe the complementary combination of our
	physical and virtual payment services provides differentiated convenience to our consumers and creates a strong network effect that drives payment volume across our business. With the recent acquisition of Contact and Rapida, we broadened the scope
	of services primarily in the money remittance and further increased our distribution network. We believe that our leading market position, proprietary network and complementary services provide us with competitive advantages that have enabled us to
	generate strong growth and profitability.

	We operate in and target markets and consumer segments that are largely cash-based or that lack
	convenient alternatives for consumers to pay for goods and services in physical, online and mobile environments. We help consumers and merchants connect more efficiently in these markets by providing an integrated network of physical and virtual
	wallets and payment channels that enable consumers to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form and transfer the funds to a virtual wallet, a variety of Visa-branded prepaid cards or pay for any merchant in our network quickly and securely &#150;
	for example, to pay bills, add minutes to their mobile phones, purchase transportation and tickets, shop online or at a retail store, buy digital services or send money to a friend or relative. Moreover, following our acquisition of Contact, our
	consumers can now make money transfers both within Russia and abroad using our extensive network of partners, which include banks branches, retail stores and certain other points of service.

	Our platform provides simple and intuitive user interfaces, convenient access and best-in-class services combined with the reputation and
	trust associated with the Qiwi group brands. The payments processed on our network are typically very small with a limit of RUB 15,000&nbsp;per transaction and, since they are primarily funded with cash, consumers do not have to undergo a lengthy
	registration process to execute certain types of transactions. Alternatively, consumers can create an online account, or virtual wallet, with Qiwi where they can store money, deposited from cash or funded from a variety of other sources, such as
	mobile phone balances, bank accounts, credit card or money transfers, that can be used to make payments and purchases at any time. Our services also allow merchants in Russia and other markets, including leading MNOs, online retailers, financial
	institutions and utilities, to accept payments via our network, enabling them to attract more consumers, generate more sales and get paid faster and more easily.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have deployed our network of kiosks and terminals using a proprietary agent model. Under this model, our
	kiosks are assembled by third party manufacturers using our proprietary specifications and are then purchased by over 6,500 agents who are responsible for placing, operating and servicing the kiosks in high-traffic and convenient retail locations.
	In addition, an agent-owned point of sale terminal, computer, laptop or mobile phone can serve as a Qiwi terminal once our proprietary software is installed on it, which allows the agent to process consumer payments to merchants through our system.
	In Russia and Kazakhstan, the Qiwi brand is well-known and our kiosks and terminals provide unique physical access to an alternative payment method for the population there. They can be found next to convenience stores, in train stations, post
	offices, retail stores or airport terminals in all of the major urban centers, as well as many small and rural towns that lack large bank branches and other financial infrastructure. In addition, we distribute our payment services through our
	virtual Visa Qiwi Wallet product, which enables consumers to access and make payments through their computers or mobile devices.

	Our physical distribution comprises approximately of 115,000 kiosks and 57,000 terminals (including various interfaces at physical points of
	service) that are assembled and sold by third party manufacturers. These kiosks and terminals run our proprietary software, which provides the user customized interfaces that display our broad range of payment services and provides the connectivity

	Our Kiosks and Terminals
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A kiosk is a stand-alone computer terminal with a touch screen and specialized hardware and software, which enables consumers to make cash
	payments to merchants. Each kiosk is connected to our network using a dedicated SIM card and is equipped with a cash acceptor, a printing device and a transaction recording device. Our kiosks are assembled by third party manufacturers using our
	proprietary specifications. Kiosks are relatively easy and inexpensive to install and operate and are equipped with specialized software that monitors the condition of the kiosk and its components, including the amount of cash stored, and the
	sufficiency of expendable materials such as thermal paper. A kiosk is also relatively simple to assemble, and we generally have not encountered any significant issues in relation to underproduction or shortage of kiosks. There are 20 base models of
	kiosk available in the Russian market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to kiosks, our network includes approximately 57,000 terminals at various retail
	locations, including a number of major Russian retail chains such as Svyaznoy and Euroset. We provide these businesses with access to our network through our proprietary software and process the payments made by their customers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our kiosks and terminals are typically owned by our agents, except in limited circumstances when we enter new markets where we may own a
	number of kiosks or terminals. We believe this ownership structure has allowed us to build a large network in a relatively short period of time. The agents purchase, install, operate and service the kiosks and terminals themselves; we provide them
	with our platform and technical solutions, help them comply with reporting requirements and provide them with various forms of support and incentives. In 2014, we signed rental agreements with large retail networks including Magnit, X5 Retail Group,
	Dixy and Monetka to further sublease those locations to our agents. We believe it is important to provide our agents with comprehensive support in order to ensure quality of service and unique competitive environment.

<I>
	How Our Kiosks and Terminals Work
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a payment through a kiosk, a consumer selects the hyperlink icon of a particular merchant on the kiosk
	screen and enters the data necessary for the merchant to identify the consumer. For instance, this may be the consumer&#146;s mobile phone number or details on the consumer&#146;s utility bill. The consumer inserts money into a cash acceptor, which
	automatically recognizes the value of the banknotes. Once the necessary amount of money has been inserted, the consumer presses a button to confirm that he or she wishes to complete the transaction, and the software installed on the kiosk sends an
	instruction to our processing system to transmit a corresponding amount to the merchant and to withdraw it from the agent&#146;s account. The kiosk then prints a receipt confirming that payment has been made. The interface of a kiosk is highly
	intuitive to facilitate a convenient user experience with the entire transaction process normally taking no more than a few minutes. A transaction is mostly automated and usually performed in three or four easy steps, so that the user is only
	required to input a minimum of information. When making a payment through a terminal, a consumer gives the same information (merchant name, amount of transaction and account identifying data) to a cashier at a cash desk, who processes it on a
	computer or a mobile phone using specialized software.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our agent base includes more than 6,500 agents who own kiosks and terminals and are responsible for placing, operating and servicing them in
	high-traffic, convenient retail locations. Most of our agents are small to mid-sized businesses, which we believe provides them with insight into local market dynamics. For many of our agents, the business of kiosk and terminal ownership is a
	full-time occupation, while some view it as an ancillary service that increases consumer traffic in their outlets or provides additional convenience to consumers. We do not consider ourselves to be materially dependent on any of our agents.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our contracts with the agents are usually for an indefinite term and may be unilaterally terminated by the agent. Our agent contracts do not
	have exclusivity clauses. Our agents determine the consumer fee for a number of services, mainly for Telecom merchants, while we control and set, if applicable, consumer commissions for services of other merchants. Moreover, we are in a position to
	cap these fees depending on our marketing actions or merchant&#146;s request. When the fee payable by the consumers is absent or capped, we normally award the agents with an increased portion of merchant fees.

	We have a virtual distribution
	channel that we operate under Visa Qiwi Wallet, Qiwi Wallet and Qiwi Wallet Europe brands. Visa Qiwi Wallet is an online and mobile payment processing and money transfer system that we offer in Russia that allows accountholders to pay for the
	products and services of merchants, and to perform peer-to-peer money transfers using a virtual wallet, which effectively replaces a physical wallet in an online and mobile environment. A virtual wallet enables its holder to make online purchases
	through a convenient, secure and intuitive online or mobile interface with multiple payment methods. Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts can be linked to virtual or physical Visa prepaid cards that can be used to make purchases at any merchants that accept
	Visa worldwide. We believe Visa Qiwi Wallet is one of the leading virtual wallet providers in Russia.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Prior to November&nbsp;2012, Visa

	With Visa Qiwi Wallet, consumers can create an online account, referred to as a virtual wallet, in which they can store money, deposited from
	cash or funded from a variety of other sources such as mobile phone balances, bank accounts, credit or debit cards, or money transfers, that can be used to make payments, purchases and peer-to-peer transfers. To register a virtual wallet, a consumer
	only needs to have a mobile phone number to which the account is linked.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The account loading process is simple and intuitive regardless of the interface
	that the consumer uses to access Visa Qiwi Wallet, whether it is our own website, the screen of a kiosk, the virtual banking service of the consumer&#146;s bank or a mobile app. Normally, a consumer just needs to enter the unique identification
	number of his or her virtual wallet and indicate the amount and source of money he or she wishes to load to the account. Likewise, while the process of making a payment through Visa Qiwi Wallet may vary slightly depending on the interface, it is
	always intuitive.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that a key part of our service offering is consumer convenience and ease of use. Visa Qiwi Wallet is
	available through a variety of interfaces, including mobile apps, its own website, touch-screens of our kiosks, merchant websites, social network applications, and SMS/USSD (whereby a payment is made by sending an SMS message to a specified phone
	number). An increasing percentage of consumers are accessing Visa Qiwi Wallet directly through mobile apps and our own website rather than through our kiosks (which was historically the most popular Qiwi Wallet interface). Nevertheless, accessing
	Visa Qiwi Wallet through our kiosks remains the primary means by which consumers load and reload their accounts, which we believe highlights the synergies between our physical and virtual distribution networks and will continue to support the
	sustainability of our business.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We offer downloadable Visa Qiwi Wallet applications for the most popular mobile and digital platforms and

	to increase our consumer base.

	How Our Virtual Wallet Works
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Payments made through Visa Qiwi Wallet can be categorized into push payments and pull payments. A push payment is a payment initiated by the
	consumer from a Visa Qiwi Wallet interface. After entering Visa Qiwi Wallet through one of its secure interfaces, a consumer is required to select the name of the merchant from a drop-down list or using a search function and to type in the payment
	amount. Consumers are not subject to a fee when making most payments through Visa Qiwi Wallet. Additionally, consumers are able to link their bank cards to their Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts to make online payments without divulging their bank card
	details on merchant websites, decreasing the perceived risk of fraud associated with online payments. A pull payment is a payment initiated by the consumer from a merchant interface, typically a merchant website through which the consumer makes a
	purchase. During the check-out process at a merchant website, the consumer chooses Visa Qiwi Wallet as a payment method and is re-directed to a Visa Qiwi Wallet web page. Next, if the consumer is already registered with Visa Qiwi Wallet, he or she
	is prompted to enter his or her mobile phone number to which his or her Visa Qiwi Wallet account is linked and his or her Visa Qiwi Wallet password. If the consumer is not yet registered with Visa Qiwi Wallet, our system automatically generates a
	virtual wallet for him or her once the mobile phone number is entered. A registered Visa Qiwi Wallet user is then required to select a source of funds to be used, including the prepaid balance of the Visa Qiwi Wallet account, a bank card previously
	linked to the Visa Qiwi Wallet account, or his or her mobile phone account. The consumer may also select a deferred payment option, whereby our system generates an electronic invoice from the merchant to the consumer which is stored in the
	consumer&#146;s virtual wallet and can be paid at a later stage. After a payment option is chosen, the consumer is required to confirm the transaction, following which funds are withdrawn from the source the consumer is using and transmitted to the
	merchant. The only option available to consumers who did not have a Visa Qiwi Wallet account previously is the deferred payment option. Once the consumer loads his or her newly registered virtual wallet or links a bank card to it, the invoice can be
	confirmed and paid, after which the transaction is completed.

	Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts can be reloaded through virtually any payment method available on the market, including making cash deposit at any of
	our kiosks or terminals, bank cards and accounts, online banking and retail. Visa Qiwi Wallet benefits in particular from access to our own network of kiosks and terminals, which is the largest cash reload network in Russia. We believe that by

	Qiwi branded kiosks and terminals are the primary means by which consumers reload their Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts. Over the last three years
	the percentage of reloads made through bank cards, mobile phone balances and directly from bank accounts was less than 15% of total reloads. However, in the recent quarters we have seen an increase in the share of this reload channels as the result
	of the decline in the number of our and third party kiosks on the market (see &#147;Item&nbsp;3.D Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry&#151;A decline in the use of cash as a means of payment or a decline in the use of kiosks
	and terminals may result in a reduced demand for our services&#148;). Consumers also use third-party networks for cash reloads. With our recently announced co-branded wallet products with MegaFon and Beeline we have provided our consumers with
	another convenient and free-of-charge top up channel which we expect to become more popular among our users.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the vast majority of active Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts were based in Russia. We expect the international
	expansion of Visa Qiwi Wallet to be focused on markets with high volumes of money transfers to and from Russia and a low penetration of banking services. These are primarily the CIS and Eastern European countries with which Russia historically has
	strong economic and social relations. For example, in 2015 we have launched a pilot project in Latvia under the brand Qiwi Wallet Europe. We believe that our services could also be in demand with e-commerce businesses, which seek to increase their
	customer base in Russia.

	Our network of merchants and consumers and flexible technology platform enable us to introduce innovative, value added, high-margin products
	and services that can generate more revenue per consumer. In November 2006, we started using the interfaces of our kiosks as an advertising medium, leveraging the strength of our network and the data that we receive from our consumers. We advertise
	mostly in the form of pop-up ad banners in the kiosk interface that allow a consumer to enter a microsite with a detailed product description. Each kiosk has 12 advertising spaces on its screen. Additionally, at the end of a transaction where a
	payment is made to an MNO we may send an SMS message to the consumer to confirm the specific transaction. This SMS message may also contain an advertisement of a product or service, provided the consumer has not opted out from receiving such
	advertisements. We also allow advertisers to create a branded page in a subsection of the kiosk menu.

	E-commerce.
</I>
	E-commerce is one of our major merchant categories and mostly comprises of merchants that
	sell their products and services online, including large international e-commerce merchants such as AliExpress, JD.com and eBay, local e-commerce merchants, social networks such as Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, online game developers such as
	Wargaming and Mail.ru and sport betting. We also accept payments on behalf of software producers, coupon websites, and numerous other merchants. Our kiosk and terminal network provides these businesses with an attractive offline interface to their
	online services, while our Visa Qiwi Wallet provide their customers with a convenient, fast and secure payment option to make online purchases and top up their personal accounts.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Financial Services.
</I>
	Financial Services includes primarily banks, micro finance organizations and insurance companies. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, we accepted payments on behalf of over 250 banks, including most major Russian retail banks such as Sberbank, VTB 24, Alfa-Bank, Tinkoff Credit Systems, Russian Standard Bank, Home Credit Bank, Promsvyazbank, Raiffeisen Bank
	and others. Based on information available from public sources, we believe our kiosk and terminal network is larger than the ATM network of any major bank, and, as a result, we are able to provide banks with the ability to reach a larger market
	through our network by enabling their customers to make deposits, replenish their cards and repay loans.

<I>
	Money Remittance.
</I>
	Our
	Money Remittance category includes major Russian and international money transfer merchants such as Western Union, Unistream, Post of Russia and Anelik. In June 2015, we acquired the Contact money transfer system, one of the largest operators on the
	Russian money transfer market. This transaction allowed us to grow our market share by leveraging the ecosystem that we have built to date and offering our clients new, convenient services. From August 2010, we offer our consumers Visa Direct and
	MasterCard Money Send services, which allow a Visa Qiwi Wallet accountholder to reload the account of a Visa or MasterCard bank card with a few clicks on our website, a mobile app, or a kiosk touch-screen, and with the only information required
	being the number of the recipient card. Since 2015, we started offering our users similar services for China Union Pay bank cards.

<I>
	Telecom.
</I>
	Telecom merchants include various telecommunication service providers, such as MNOs, internet services providers, pay
	television channels and public utilities. MNOs, in particular the three largest operators in Russia, have historically represented the largest portion of our merchant base and are expected to continue to do so in terms of volumes for the foreseeable
	future. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Big Three MNOs accounted for 32%, 26% and 19% of our payment volume, respectively. However, their share in our transaction volume has been falling over the last three years due
	to the expansion of our merchant base and the increased use of our payment systems by the consumers for purposes other than mobile phone account reloading.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While we already have considerable penetration
	with recurring payments merchants (such as MNOs and internet services providers), financial services providers and e-commerce businesses, there are numerous markets in which we see significant opportunity to add merchants. For example, we view
	payments for fee-based services for federal, state and municipal authorities as a good point of market entry for new users as these authorities increasingly automate payments. We have already entered into direct agreements with the Federal Tax
	Service, the State Traffic Safety Authority, the Independent Security Services Bureau of the Interior Ministry&#146;s Moscow Department, the Federal Bailiff Service and the Federal Service for State Registration, Cadastre and Cartography.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our services are based on our advanced, proprietary high-performing technology platform. All of our key technology has been developed in-house.
	Our platform utilizes innovative Java and Scala -based architecture, which enables us to have scalable, clustered, fault tolerant processing system and various consumer, merchant and agent interfaces. In addition, the interfaces are connected to the
	processing system through a secure protocol.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Hardware supporting our platform is hosted in two leased data centers (build in an
	active-active mode and linked in a private data cloud, each capable of handling twice the usual traffic), located in a geographically distributed parts of Moscow. The data centers have been Payment Card Industry Digital Security Standard (PCI DSS)
	certified, and one of them is ISO 27001 security standard compliant as well. We are able to switch our processing core between the data centers within three minutes. Furthermore, in order to support uninterruptible connectivity, we linked our
	headquarters and both data centers via fiber optics with at least doubled lines between any two locations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The principal software under
	which the kiosks operate is our proprietary application called Maratl, which enables payment acceptance, proper billing and processing connectivity. Maratl is a cutting edge software that employs, among others, such technological features as
	code-obfuscation and strong 3-layer proprietary cryptographic network protocols. Such security features enable kiosks and terminals to connect with any open communication network as the data flow is strongly protected. Our kiosks are not connected
	to each other, thus reducing any network risks. Kiosk infrastructure including hardware, software and the network as a whole are certified with Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA DSS).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Visa Qiwi Wallet is the application that enables customers to pay online easily and quickly to thousands of merchants and services, using
	either mobile or web interface. Our customers are also able to utilize card technologies using Qiwi Visa Plastic or Qiwi Visa Card - physical or virtual cards issued and linked to Visa Qiwi Wallet account balance or pure virtual cards with a stored
	balance - Qiwi Visa Virtual.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have a robust transaction intelligence system designed to trace and prevent suspicious transactions
	inside our payment network. In the vast majority of cases, fraud through Visa Qiwi Wallet is attributable to scams rather than to a security system failure. We also employ a certified 3-D secure system similar to those adopted by other major payment
	networks and banks. We have established a sophisticated system of security monitoring utilizing the Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) and Security Operations Center (SOC), each of which are operating and supported continuously.
	Our critical internal resources are protected with an advanced intrusion prevention system (IPS); all applications are protected with a web application firewall (WAF) set up in a blocking mode ensuring all unauthorized or ambiguous activities are
	prohibited. Moreover, we have in-house forensic lab that assesses any potentially harmful events.

	Our Framework Agreement with Visa dated
	November&nbsp;19, 2012 imposes stringent security requirements on us to protect the data of our consumers. Under the terms of this agreement, we are under an obligation to be compliant with Visa-approved security standards and to undergo periodic
	assessments to certify such compliance. In particular, we have annual PCI DSS compliance audits fulfilled by qualified security assessors.

	The most significant competitive factors in our business are speed, convenience, network size, accessibility, hours of operation, loyalty
	programs, reliability and price. Our competitors include retail banks, non-traditional payment services providers (such as retailers and MNOs), traditional kiosk and terminal operators and electronic payment system operators as well as other
	companies which provide various forms of payment services, including electronic payment and payment processing services.

	We face
	significant competition from major retail banks. Our competitors include, among others, Sberbank, Russia&#146;s largest retail bank that is majority-owned by the Russian state, and Alfa-Bank, one of the leading privately owned Russian retail banks,
	both of which have robust electronic payment products and large retail networks. Some retail banks are currently developing their own kiosk networks and are active in the area of electronic payment products.

	We also face competition from major telecommunication and media devices retailers, including Euroset and Svyaznoy, which offer some financial
	and payment services of third-party providers, such as instant money transfers, loan repayments, utilities payment and other services, and sell third-party insurance and consumer banking products, building on the strength of their retail networks.
	We compete to an extent with the MNOs, which allow their subscribers to make instant payments using their mobile phone balances.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	The regulation of the payment services industry in Russia is relatively nascent. Laws and regulations specifically governing the industry have

	Virtual wallet operations are legally considered cashless transfers with the use of bank cards. For regulatory purposes, when a Visa Qiwi
	Wallet account is reloaded, the accountholder is issued one or several virtual prepaid cards, depending on the amount of the reload. While the accountholder agrees to the issuance of the cards through accepting a public offer, he or she is not
	explicitly provided with details of each card. From a consumer&#146;s perspective, the amount of the reload is simply transferred to an account of a digital wallet, whereas legally it becomes stored value of a virtual prepaid card.

	A prepaid card is an electronic means of payment allowing its holder to carry out transfers of electronic money within the limits of the funds
	previously deposited with the issuing credit institution. Amendments to the&nbsp;CBR Regulation No.&nbsp;266-P &#147;On the Issuance of Bank Cards and Payment Cards Operations&#148; conferring the status of electronic means of payment on prepaid
	cards were approved by the CBR Directive No.&nbsp;2862-U, dated August&nbsp;10, 2012, and came into effect on July&nbsp;1, 2013. From that date, the legal regime of the prepaid cards is that established for electronic money by the Federal Law of the

	Electronic money is defined under the Payment System Law as prepaid monetary value contributed by the &#147;provider&#148; to the
	&#147;obligor&#148; of which a record is kept by the obligor without the opening of a bank account, which can be used for the settlement of the provider&#146;s monetary obligations towards third parties, and in respect of which the provider may only
	issue instructions via electronic means of payment. Electronic money is also treated as a liability of the obligor towards the provider. Electronic means of payment are defined as any methods and instruments which allow drawing up, certifying and
	transmitting instructions for electronic money transfers and which employ information and telecommunication technologies, electronic data carriers and other technical devices. The Payment System Law classifies electronic means of payment into
	personalized and non-personalized, depending on whether they allow for identification of the payer for the purposes of the Federal Law of the Russian Federation No.&nbsp;115-FZ &#147;On Combating the Legalization (Laundering) of Criminally Obtained
	Income and Funding of Terrorism&#148;, dated August&nbsp;7, 2001, as amended, or the Anti-Money Laundering Law. Any electronic money transfers are subject to thresholds on remaining electronic money balances, which amount to RUB 600,000 for
	personalized means of payment and RUB 15,000 for non-personalized means of payment (or RUB 60,000 if the holder underwent a simplified identification procedure &#150; see &#147;- The Anti-Money Laundering Law &#147;). The total monthly turnover for

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Payment Agents Law only applies to services providers such as JSC QIWI that process cash payments without having the status of a credit
	institution (under Russian law, credit institutions include banks and non-banking credit institutions which are entitled to carry out a limited number of banking operations) and thus are not regulated by banking legislation. Merchants on whose
	behalf payment agents may accept payments include legal entities and individual entrepreneurs, as well as state and municipal authorities and budget-funded entities that provide fee-based services in furtherance of their functions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Payment Agents Law requires payment agents to comply with the Anti-Money Laundering Law. A payment agent may only act as such once it
	registers with the government authority responsible for compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering Law (currently, the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring, or Rosfinmonitoring).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A payment agent acts on the basis of an agency agreement with the merchant. Such agency agreements are governed by the Russian Civil Code,
	certain provisions of which are described in more detail below. A payment agent may also engage sub-agents (referred to as &#147;payment sub-agents&#148; under the Payment Agents Law) if the agency agreement so provides. Our agents act as payment
	sub-agents for the purposes of the Payment Agents Law. Payment sub-agents may not accept payments that require identification of the customer pursuant to the Anti-Money Laundering Law. Under the Anti-Money Laundering Law, such customer
	identification is required for all money transfers exceeding RUB&nbsp;15,000, while at least a simplified identification process is required for any peer-to-peer money transfers and transfers to foreign merchants.

	The payment agent&#146;s obligation to transmit the funds to the merchant is required to be either insured or secured by means of a pledge,

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Acceptance of payments on behalf of certain types of merchants, including foreign entities, is carved out from the scope of the Payment Agents
	Law. This does not imply that a company which has the status of a payment agent is prohibited from accepting payments on behalf of such merchants. However, activities in this regard are not regulated by the Payment Agents Law, but rather by the
	universally applicable provisions of the Russian Civil Code pertaining to agency agreements. In particular, the Civil Code contains certain basic requirements for agency agreements, including their conditions and their termination and sets out rules
	pertaining to certain rights of the agent and the principal and allocation of various responsibilities between them. Agency services may not be provided free of charge. The Civil Code permits agency agreements to include exclusivity clauses. Agency
	agreements may be entered into for fixed or indefinite periods of time. However, if an agency agreement is entered into for an indefinite period of time, it may be terminated unilaterally at the discretion of either counterparty.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Payment Agents Law provides that payment agents are entitled to levy fees from the merchants&#146; customers for each transaction
	processed by them. These fees are not statutorily capped, although proposals to cap them are from time to time considered by the Russian legislature.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Payment agents are required to use cash registering facilities with a built-in fiscal memory and a reference tape (an electronic device which
	allows long-term storage of records of transactions performed through a kiosk), in order to monitor payments received. They are also required to issue receipts for each transaction.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Payment Agents Law requires both the payment agent and the merchant serviced by it to maintain segregated bank accounts for the purpose of
	depositing funds received from the customers and from the payment agent, respectively. All funds received by a payment agent need to be deposited into such specialized accounts.

	Although the CBR authority in respect of monitoring the activities of the payment agents is limited to collection, systematization and
	analysis of industry data, the CBR activities may have indirect impact on payment agents. For instance, in April 2015 the CBR issued recommendations to credit institutions to enhance their scrutiny over the compliance by the payment agents with
	legislation that requires them to remit their proceeds to special accounts, which resulted in a decline in the number of our active kiosks.

	identification requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering Law, unless officers of a financial service provider suspect that such operation is carried out to legalize funds received from illegal activities or to finance terrorism. Money transfers
	by individuals not exceeding RUB&nbsp;15,000 are generally exempt from the identification requirement, but since May&nbsp;5, 2014, peer-to-peer transfer and transfers to foreign entities and certain kinds of non-profits require at least a simplified
	identification of the customer regardless of the amount. The key difference between the simplified procedure and the procedure that must be followed in all other circumstances is that simplified identification can be performed remotely. However, the
	simplified identification process is still not well defined and the public databases that such remote identification is supposed to be based on are still not entirely operational, which could cause us to be in violation of the identification
	requirements. The identification requirements of the Anti-Money Laundering Law only pertain to individual transactions and not series of transactions.

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a leading provider of next generation payment services in Russia and the CIS. We have an integrated proprietary network that enables
	payment services across physical, online and mobile channels. We operate in target markets and customer segments that are largely cash-based and lack convenient alternatives for consumers to pay for goods and services in physical, online and mobile
	environments.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have built a physical network of over 172,000 kiosks and terminals using a proprietary agent model. Under this model,
	our kiosks and terminals are built with our proprietary specifications and technology by third party manufacturers and then purchased and managed by approximately 6,500 agents responsible for placing, operating and servicing the kiosks in
	high-traffic, convenient retail locations. We also distribute our payment services online through our virtual Visa Qiwi Wallet product, which enables consumers to access and make payments through their computers or mobile devices. The payments
	processed through our network are typically very small with a limit of RUB 15,000&nbsp;per transaction, and since they are primarily funded with cash, consumers do not have to go through a lengthy registration process to execute most transactions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our primary source of revenue is fees we receive for processing payments made by consumers to merchants, which we refer to as payment
	processing fees, typically based on a percentage of the size of the transactions that we process, which we refer to as payment volume. We refer to payment processing fees that are paid to us by merchants for collecting payments on their behalf as
	merchant fees and to payment processing fees that are paid by our consumers directly to us or transmitted to us by our agents as consumer fees. We typically pass on a portion of the merchant fees to our agents.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In September 2010, we acquired Qiwi Bank, which provides the issuing, acquiring and deposit settlement functions of our group. In addition, in
	2015 we acquired Rapida LTD, which operates payment processing and money transfer settlements within our group.

	Payment processing fees

	. Payment processing fees constitute the substantial majority of our revenue and comprise
	fees charged for processing payments typically based on a percentage of the total volume of each payment. A majority of our payment processing fees are paid to us by merchants for collecting payments on their behalf, which we refer to as merchant
	fees, and the fees paid by consumers, which we refer to as consumer fees. We typically pass on a portion of the merchants fees to our agents. In certain situations, we may not receive any merchant fees, for example, when a merchant is a government
	body. We generally recognize merchant fees gross at the point when merchants accept payments from the consumer. Consumer fees fall into two categories &#150; those collected by us directly and those collected by our agents. We recognize revenue from
	consumer fees charged through Visa Qiwi Wallet as well as most revenue from consumer fees charged through our kiosks and terminals gross at the point when the consumer makes a payment.

	In either one or both of the two types of
	payment processing fees above, or in some cases, payment processing fees apply to a single consumer payment. Transaction costs relate to acquisition of payments by agents, mobile operators, international payment systems and some other parties, and
	the applicable fees, generally determined as a percentage of consumer payment, for each specific payment channel are on terms similar to those available to other market participants.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A merchant fee, when it is charged, is recorded gross of related costs, because (i) we are the primary obligor as we undertake to transfer the
	customer payment to the merchant using our payment processing system; (ii)&nbsp;we negotiate and ultimately set the commission rate receivable from a merchant; and (iii)&nbsp;we bear credit risk in most of the cases, unless the payment is made from
	a deposit made with our group.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A consumer fee, when it is charged on payments made by consumers through kiosks and terminals, is reported
	net of any fees payable to or retained by agents. This is because, although we are the primary obligor, we do not have any discretion over the ultimate commission set by the agent as a kiosk or terminal owner to the customer, we do not have readily
	available information about the gross commission, and we are only exposed to the net amount of commission payable to us by the agent.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A
	consumer fee collected through mobile operators and other payment methods is reported gross of related transaction costs. Such payments are made by consumers through our website or an application using a unique user login and password, and are
	called electronic payments. In contrast with the consumer fee collected through kiosks and terminals, we, being a primary obligor in electronic payment transactions, also set the consumer fee, although credit risk for these transactions is limited.
	Thus, we have concluded that our ability to control the consumer fee for electronic payments is a key differentiator from the customer fees on payments collected through our kiosks and terminals.

	The expected life of the option represents the period during which our option awards are expected to be
	outstanding. The expected life of each option tranche was based on the simplified method outlined in Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107, Share-Based Compensation, because, prior to our initial public offering, we were a privately held company
	and our share-based compensation plan is relatively new. Accordingly, we do not have sufficient experience or history to be able to determine the expected life over which our option awards will be held before exercise. This method is also in line
	with the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	With respect to price volatility, because, prior to our initial public offering, we
	operated as a private company with no active market for our shares or option awards, and currently we still do not have sufficient history of our share price performance, it is not possible to use actual price volatility data. Therefore, we
	estimated the volatility of our shares based on the historical volatility of peer group companies over a period which approximates our expected life of option awards. Using an expected volatility based on the average historical volatility of other
	entities may result in variability when compared to actual historical volatility once we have sufficient historical data about the market price for our shares.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We based the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option-pricing model on the implied yield currently available on the US treasury
	bonds, adjusted for a country risk premium, with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the option award being valued.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At
	the time of the grant date of the options on December&nbsp;21, 2012, we expected that we would not pay cash dividends after the closing of the initial public offering. In light of that expectation, we used an expected dividend yield of zero in our
	option pricing model for option awards granted in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012. In April 2013, our board of directors subsequently reconsidered this determination, and we currently expect that we will pay dividends from time to time in the
	future. Any determination regarding the amount of future dividends will depend on a range of factors, including the availability of distributable profits, our liquidity and financial position, our strategic plans and growth initiatives, restrictions
	imposed by our financing arrangements, tax considerations, planned acquisitions, and other relevant factors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We determined the amount of
	share-based compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest, taking into account estimated forfeitures. IFRS requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
	forfeitures differ from those estimates. To properly attribute compensation expense, we are required to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
	estimates. We have no past history of forfeitures, but the retention rate amongst our key employees and management was historically high. Therefore, our forfeiture rate is expected to be insignificant. As a result, we have applied an estimated
	forfeiture rate of zero in 2013 and actual year-to-date rate of forfeitures in 2014 and 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because, prior to our initial public
	offering, there had been no public market for our shares, with the assistance of an independent valuation firm, we determined the fair value of our shares on the basis of valuations of our company arrived at by employing the &#147;income
	approach&#148; and the &#147;market approach&#148; valuation methodologies described further below. Since May 2013, QIWI plc is a public company and the fair value of its shares is defined by reference to closing market price of its traded shares.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the income approach, we relied on the discounted cash flows (DCF) method. The DCF method involves applying appropriate discount
	rates to estimated cash flows that are based on forecasts of revenue and costs. Key assumptions associated with the income approach include projected revenue, profit and cash flows which reflect management&#146;s best estimates of our future
	operations at the time; a terminal value, which attributes value to cash flows for the years beyond the projection period; and a discount rate, which reflects then expected market rates of interest rates and risks associated with the business.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the market approach, we relied on the guideline publicly traded company method as well as the prior transaction method, if such
	transactions were available. The guideline publicly traded company method provides an indication of our value by comparing the enterprise value to earnings and revenue multiples of similar publicly traded companies in our industry. In applying the
	prior transaction method, we would consider the most recent transaction in our company&#146;s shares.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To estimate the fair value of our
	shares for the December 2012 grants, the income approach, using the DCF method, and the market approach were employed. In the DCF method, a post-tax discount rate of 12.5% was used. A discount for lack of marketability of 8.21% was also applied. DCF
	was used as the primary method and the guideline publicly traded company approach was used to determine if the DCF valuation was in the range of reasonable values for December 2012 option awards.

	The prior transaction method was not used for the December 2012 valuation study because it was
	determined that duration of time and respective changes in market conditions since the most recent arm&#146;s length transaction with our shares that closed in December 2010 rendered this transaction a less reliable indicator of the value of our
	company. However, the prior transaction method provided an indirect evidence of the fair value of our shares. In particular, the publicly disclosed value of the transaction between our shareholders in December 2010 was U.S.$24.1&nbsp;million for
	3.74% of our shares, representing approximately U.S.$12.40&nbsp;per share. The growth of the estimated share price from U.S.$12.40&nbsp;per share in December 2010 to U.S.$15.84 on December 2012, as implied by the DCF method and market approach, or
	27%, was linked to a number of factors, including improving performance in 2011 and 2012 and improved liquidity prospects due to the planned initial public offering.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The DCF method used to estimate the fair value of our shares is highly sensitive to growth rates, with the principal drivers being the level
	of internet traffic, our market share, and the size of the online advertising market generally. Additionally, the guideline public company method is highly sensitive to the choice of guideline companies and changes in market multiples of those
	guideline companies, as well as our company&#146;s relative performance in comparison with the selected peers.

	On December&nbsp;21, 2012,

	Revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was RUB 17,717&nbsp;million, an increase of 20%, or RUB
	2,998&nbsp;million, compared to the same period in 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase in payment processing fees. Payment processing fees for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 were RUB 14,935&nbsp;million, an increase of 22%,
	or RUB 2,685&nbsp;million, compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in payment processing fees resulted primarily from an increase in payment volumes by 35%, or RUB 228 billion, from RUB 645 billion in 2014 to RUB 873 billion in 2015,
	primarily resulting from the acquisition of Contact and Rapida, the growth in payment volumes in higher yielding payment categories, such as E-commerce and Money Remittance offset by a decrease of average net revenue yield following the acquisition
	and consolidation of the Contact and Rapida businesses, which historically were lower yielding, and an increase in inactivity fees by 70%, or RUB 457&nbsp;million, from RUB 656&nbsp;million in 2014 to RUB 1,113&nbsp;million in 2015 as a result of
	changes to the write-off policy as well as consolidation of Contact and Rapida.

	1.37% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 to 1.17% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Excluding inactivity fees, average net revenue yield decreased by 22 bps, from 1.27% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 to 1.04% for the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The decrease in average net revenue yield is primarily due to consolidation of the historically lower yielding Contact and Rapida businesses partly offset by an increase (as a percentage of payment volume) of higher
	yielding transactions such as E-commerce and a decrease in transactions with lower yields, such as Telecoms.

	3,469&nbsp;million, an increase of 13%, or RUB 387&nbsp;million, from 2014. This increase resulted primarily from growth of payroll, related taxes and other expenses by 12%, or RUB 162&nbsp;million, from RUB 1,349&nbsp;million in 2014 to RUB
	1,511&nbsp;million in 2015 due to: (i)&nbsp;the aforementioned restructuring which resulted in transfer of salary expenses of certain employees from the cost of revenue to selling, general and administrative expenses; (ii)&nbsp;an increase in
	payroll expenses of newly acquired subsidiaries, including CIHRUS LLC; (iii)&nbsp;increase of ruble salaries of foreign subsidiaries (denominated in foreign currencies), partially offset by the decrease in share-based payment expenses. Further
	selling, general and administrative expenses were affected by an increase in bad debt expenses from RUB 151&nbsp;million in 2014 to RUB 362&nbsp;million in 2015, resulting mainly from an increase in reserves for receivables from several of
	QIWI&#146;s agents who have shown signs of financial instability; an increase of rent of premises expenses from RUB 242&nbsp;million in 2014 to RUB 338&nbsp;million in 2015 primarily due to higher USD rate; an increase in office maintenance expenses
	from RUB 237&nbsp;million in 2014 to RUB 310&nbsp;million in 2015 due to increased automation expenses; and the increase in other tax expenses. These effects were partially offset by a decrease in advertising and related expenses by 53%, or RUB
	271&nbsp;million, from RUB 513&nbsp;million in 2014 to RUB 242&nbsp;million in 2015 as there were no significant marketing activities in 2015 as compared to 2014.

	An important part of our credit risk management and payment settlement strategy relies on deposits we receive from agents in advance for
	payments made through the kiosks. When a payment is made through a kiosk, we offset these deposits against the payments we make to the merchant. For certain agents with whom we have long and reliable relationships, we provide limited credit support
	in the form of overdrafts and loans for processing payments.

	banking sector resulting into fewer working capital financing options available for our agents. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, deposits issued to our merchants were RUB&nbsp;2,723 million, compared to RUB 4,331&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
	2014 and RUB&nbsp;1,939&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2013. The decline predominantly resulted from partial substitution of deposits with bank guarantees.

	agents significantly declined in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the decrease of our agent network and the financial instability of some of our agents, as a result of more stringent regulation by the CBR and the overall deterioration of the Russian
	economy in 2015. However, the Group has no long term debt obligations and has sufficient cash in order to meet its current liabilities.

	Net cash inflow generated from operating activities for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 was RUB 4,755&nbsp;million, compared to RUB
	4,725&nbsp;million for the same period in 2013. The increase in net cash flow from operating activities is a result of an increase in profit before tax, the cash effect of which was partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange gains, net, and
	changes in working capital, primarily an increase in accounts payable and accruals partially offset by an increase in trade and other receivables.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	General. In October 2012, our board of directors adopted and our shareholders approved an Employee Stock Option Plan, or the 2012 Plan, an
	equity-based incentive compensation plan intended to help align the interests of our management and others with those of our shareholders. Certain amendments were introduced to the 2012 Plan in 2013 and 2015. Under the 2012 Plan, we may grant
	options to purchase our class B shares to employees and service providers in connection with their provision of services to us or our subsidiaries. A maximum of 3,640,000 of our class B shares, or 7% of our entire issued and outstanding share
	capital as of the date immediately preceding our initial public offering, are reserved for issuance under the 2012 Plan, subject to equitable adjustment in the event of certain corporate transactions, such as a stock split or recapitalization. The
	2012 Plan is scheduled to expire on the tenth anniversary of its adoption, although previously granted awards will remain outstanding after such date in accordance with their terms.

	Administration. Our chief executive officer and our deputy chief executive officer administer the 2012 Plan, including determining the vesting
	schedule, exercise price, term of the award, transfer restrictions applicable to shares acquired pursuant to an option exercise and other terms and conditions of option awards under the 2012 Plan. Our board of directors has the authority to make all
	necessary or appropriate interpretations of 2012 Plan terms. The participants of the 2012 Plan are also selected by our chief executive officer.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Option Terms Generally. Options granted under the 2012 Plan permit the holder of the option to purchase our class B shares once such options
	are vested and exercisable, at a purchase price per share determined by our board of directors and specified in the option grant. Grants of options under the 2012 Plan following the initial public offering have a purchase price per share not less
	than the average closing price of our class B shares on the principal exchange on which such shares are then traded for the ten business days immediately preceding the date of grant. Options granted under the 2012 Plan cannot be sold, pledged or
	disposed of in any manner without our prior written consent.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Net Income Transfer Restriction. All options granted under the 2012 Plan are
	subject to an additional transfer restriction applicable to shares acquired by exercising the option. This transfer restriction prohibits the individual from transferring these shares unless we have achieved RUB 5,359,284,000 in net income (measured
	in accordance with the management reporting practices) during the previous 12 month period. We determine at the end of each fiscal quarter whether such net income test has been met and, to the extent that it has not been met, individuals holding
	shares acquired through the exercise of these options are not permitted to transfer the shares while they remain employed by us or one of our subsidiaries. This transfer restriction will cease to apply in the event that the option holder&#146;s
	employment or service with us or our subsidiaries terminates. In May 2015 our board of directors eliminated the net income target restriction for half of the vested option shares of each participant of the 2012 Plan and replaced the initial U.S.$170
	million net income target by the RUB 5,359,284,000 net income target (the amount is the equivalent of U.S.$170 million converted into Russian ruble at the foreign exchange rate as of October&nbsp;31, 2012, which was the date of approval of the 2012
	Plan) for the remaining half of the vested option shares of each participant of the 2012 Plan.

	shares to the pool of shares available under the 2012 Plan) or the adoption of a new equity compensation plan is subject to approval by our shareholders to the extent required under Cypriot law.

	Our company has a single-tier board structure, with a board of directors comprised of up to nine directors nominated and elected by the
	shareholders (subject to certain exemptions), including not less than three directors who shall be independent directors (see also &#147;Description of Share Capital&#151;Board of Directors&#148;). The primary responsibility of our board of
	directors is to oversee the operations of our company, and to supervise the policies of senior management and the affairs of our company. The term for the directors serving on our board of directors at the time of the annual report will expire at
	the annual general meeting of shareholders to be held in 2016. Our directors shall be elected at each subsequent annual general meeting of shareholders. Our articles of association provide that we may have up to nine directors, including not less
	than three independent directors. Non-independent directors shall not be more than six.

	Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, a director
	employed by us or that has, or had, certain relationships with us during the three years prior to this annual report, cannot be deemed to be an independent director, and each other director will qualify as independent, only if our board of directors
	affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with us, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us. Ownership of a significant amount of our shares, by itself,
	does not constitute a material relationship. Our articles of association provide that any elected director may be qualified as an independent director if such director meets certain criteria under the NASDAQ Listing Rules. Accordingly, our board of
	directors has affirmatively determined that Mr.&nbsp;Dmitry Pleskonos, Mr.&nbsp;Marcus Rhodes, Mr.&nbsp;Ron Kalifa, Mr.&nbsp;Osama Bedier and Mr.&nbsp;Andrey Shemetov are each an independent director in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

	We intend to distribute

	limited to merger and acquisition activities and capital expenditures. The board of directors reserves the right to distribute the dividend on a quarterly basis as it deems necessary. This statement is a general declaration of intention and the
	actual declaration of dividends will require corporate action at the relevant time on which a decision will be taken by the board of directors or the general meeting of its shareholders, as the case may be, depending on the precise circumstances
	that prevail at the time, and shareholders or potential investors should not treat this statement as an obligation or similar undertaking by us that dividends will be declared as set out herein. Under Cyprus law, we are not allowed to make
	distributions if the distribution would reduce our shareholders&#146; equity below the sum of the issued share capital, including any share premium, and the reserves which we must maintain under Cyprus law and our articles of association.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a holding company, the level of our income and our ability to pay dividends depend primarily upon the receipt of dividends and other
	distributions from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends by our subsidiaries is contingent upon the sufficiency of their earnings, cash flows, regulatory capital requirements, and distributable profits.

	us with respect to the ordinary shares underlying our ADSs, including the full amount of any Cypriot withholding tax thereon, will be a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder to the extent paid
	out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. Because we do not intend to maintain
	calculations of our earnings and profits on the basis of U.S. federal income tax principles, U.S. Holders should expect that any distribution paid will generally be reported to them as a &#147;dividend&#148; for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
	Dividends received by individuals and other non-corporate U.S. Holders of our ADSs that are traded on Nasdaq will be eligible for beneficial rates of taxation provided we are not a PFIC during the year in which the dividend is paid or the prior

	As an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. holder of &#147;marketable stock&#148; in a PFIC

	on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter, but may not be made with respect to our ordinary shares as they are not marketable stock. We anticipate that our ADSs should qualify as being actively traded, but no assurances may be given in this
	regard. If a U.S. Holder of our ADSs makes this election, the U.S. Holder will generally (i)&nbsp;include as income for each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of our ADSs held at the end of the taxable year over the adjusted
	tax basis of such ADSs and (ii)&nbsp;deduct as a loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of our ADSs over the fair market value of such ADSs held at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included
	in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in our ADSs would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election. In addition, any gain such U.S. Holder recognizes
	upon the sale or other disposition of our ADSs will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark to market election. If a

	has not previously made a mark-to-market election, and who is considering making a mark-to-market election, special tax rules may apply relating to purging the PFIC taint of such ADSs. Because a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower

	Where a non-resident holder of ADSs receives income from a Russian source, the Russian tax (if applicable under
	Russian domestic tax law) may be reduced or eliminated in accordance with the provisions of a double tax treaty. Advance treaty relief should be available for those eligible, subject to the requirements of the laws of Russia. In order for a
	non-resident holder to benefit from the applicable double tax treaty, documentary evidence is required to confirm the applicability of the double tax treaty for which benefits are claimed. Currently, a non-resident holder is required to provide a
	tax residence confirmation issued by the competent tax authority of the relevant treaty country (duly apostilled or legalized, translated into Russian and notarized). The tax residency confirmation needs to be renewed on an annual basis, and
	provided before the first payment of income in each calendar year. In addition, a non-resident who is an individual must provide appropriate documentary proof of tax payments outside of Russia on income with respect to which treaty benefits are
	claimed. Because of the uncertainties regarding the form and procedures for providing such documentary proof, individuals, in practice, may not be able to obtain advance treaty benefits on receipt of proceeds from a source within Russia, and it can
	be extremely difficult to obtain a refund.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Starting from January&nbsp;01, 2016, in order to obtain the double tax treaty relief at
	source, a non-resident holder&#151;individual should confirm to a tax agent that he or she is tax resident in a relevant foreign jurisdiction having a double tax treaty with Russia by providing the tax agent with (i)&nbsp;a passport of a foreign
	resident, or (ii)&nbsp;another document envisaged by an applicable federal law or recognized as a personal identity document of a foreign resident in accordance with the double tax treaty, and (iii)&nbsp;upon request of the tax agent, a tax
	residency certificate issued by the competent authorities of his or her country of residence for tax purposes. A notarized Russian translation of the certificate is required. The above provisions are intended to provide a tax agent with the
	opportunity of applying reduced (or zero) withholding tax rates under an applicable double tax treaty at source. However, there is some uncertainty as to how these provisions will be applied by the Russian tax authorities in practice.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, in order to benefit from the applicable double tax treaty, the person claiming such benefits must be the beneficial owner of the
	relevant income. Starting from January&nbsp;01, 2015, in addition to a certificate of tax residency, the Russian Tax Code allows the tax agent to require a confirmation from the non-resident holder &#150; legal entity that it is the beneficial owner
	of the relevant income. As of the date of this annual report there has been no guidance on the form of such confirmation and it is at the moment unclear how these measures will be applied in practice. Due to introduction of these changes, there can
	be no assurance that treaty relief at source will be available in practice.

	Financial assets, which potentially subject us and our subsidiaries and associates to credit risk, consist principally of trade receivables,
	loans receivable issued, cash and short-term investments. We sell services on a prepayment basis or ensure that our receivables are from customers with an appropriate credit history &#150; large merchants and agents with sufficient and appropriate
	credit history. Our receivables from merchants and others, except for agents, are generally non-interest-bearing and do not require collateral. Receivables and loans from agents are interest-bearing and unsecured. We hold cash primarily with
	reputable Russian and international banks, including the Central Bank of Russia, which management considers having minimal risk of default, although credit ratings of Russian and Kazakh banks are generally lower than those banks in more developed
	markets. Short-term investments include fixed-rate debt instruments issued by the top Russian banks. The carrying amount of accounts receivable, net of allowance for impairment of receivables, represents the maximum amount exposed to credit risk for
	this type of receivables. The table below demonstrates the largest counterparties&#146; balances as a percentage of respective totals:

	The company&#146;s management, with the participation of the company&#146;s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the
	effectiveness of the company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The term &#147;disclosure controls and procedures,&#148; as defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and
	other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
	specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
	under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#146;s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
	recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
	possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the company&#146;s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date,
	the company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	We have audited Qiwi plc and subsidiaries&#146; internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria
	established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Qiwi plc&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted
	our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
	financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
	operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
	financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union, and IFRS as published by the IASB. A company&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
	company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
	with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a

	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
	prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
	or procedures may deteriorate.

	We have

	cash flow statements for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
	based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
	disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
	provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
	consolidated financial position of Qiwi plc at December 31, 2014 and 2015, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with International Financial Reporting

	The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from operating a business (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are

	The Group&#146;s investment in its associate is accounted for using the

	Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is
	carried on the statement of financial position at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group&#146;s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither
	amortized nor individually tested for impairment.

	The statement of comprehensive income reflects the Group&#146;s share of the results of operations of
	the associate. When there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealized gains and losses

	The Group&#146;s share of

	After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to
	recognize an additional impairment loss on its investment in its associates. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group
	calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of an investment in associate and its carrying value and recognizes respective loss in the statement of comprehensive income.

	Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognizes any retaining investment at its fair value. Any difference between

	The consolidated financial statements are presented in Russian rubles

	statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the functional currency rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
	liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-measured in to the functional currency at the functional currency rate of exchange at the reporting date. All differences are taken to profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms

	The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an
	indication that an asset, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life, may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset&#146;s
	recoverable amount. An asset&#146;s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset&#146;s or cash-generating unit&#146;s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate
	cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In
	assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair
	value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used.

	If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried at amortized cost has been incurred,
	the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset&#146;s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial
	asset&#146;s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognized in profit or

	If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the

	In the case of equity investments classified as AFS, objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of
	the investment below its cost. &#145;Significant&#146; is evaluated against the original cost of the investment and &#145;prolonged&#146; against the period in which the fair value has been below its original cost. When there is evidence of
	impairment, the cumulative loss &#150; measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognized in the profit or loss &#150; is removed from OCI and
	recognized in the profit or loss. Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through profit or loss; increases in their fair value after impairment are recognized in OCI.

	Either one of the two types of payment processing fees above,
	or in some cases, both payment processing fees apply to a single consumer payment. Transaction costs relate to acquisition of payments by agents, mobile operators, international payment systems and some other parties, and the applicable fees,
	generally determined as a percentage of consumer payment, for each specific payment channel are on terms similar to those available to other market participants.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A merchants&#146; payment processing fee, when it is charged, is recorded gross of related transaction costs, because the Group (i)&nbsp;is the primary
	obligor as it undertakes to transfer the consumer payment to the merchant or other individual using its payment processing system; (ii)&nbsp;it negotiates and ultimately sets the fee receivable from a merchant or consumer, generally as a percentage
	of payments; and (iii)&nbsp;it bears credit risk in most of the cases, unless the payment is made from a deposit made with the Group.

	A consumer payment
	processing fee, when it is charged on payments made by consumers through payment kiosks, is reported net of any transaction costs payable to or retained by agents. This is because, although the Group is the primary obligor, it does not have any
	discretion over the ultimate payment processing fee set by the agent to the consumer, does not have readily available information about gross fee, and is only exposed to the net amount of fee receivable from agents.

	A consumer payment processing fee revenue collected through mobile operators and other payment methods is reported gross of related transaction costs. Such
	payments are made by consumers through the Group&#146;s website or an application using a unique user login and password, and are called e-payments. In contrast with the consumer payment processing fee revenue collected through payment kiosks, the
	Group, being a primary obligor in e-payment transactions, also sets the consumer&#146;s payment processing fee, generally as a percentage of payment, although credit risk for these transactions is limited. Thus, the Group concluded that its ability
	to control the consumer payment processing fee for e-payments is a key differentiator from the consumer payment processing fees on payments collected through payment kiosks.

	Management estimates the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. The option pricing
	models were originally developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have different characteristics than the stock options granted by the Company and its subsidiaries and associates. The models are also sensitive to changes
	in the subjective assumptions, which can materially affect the fair value estimate. These subjective assumptions include the expected life of the options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yield, the fair value of the
	underlying shares. The amount of expense is also sensitive to the number of awards, which are expected to vest, taking into account estimated forfeitures. Below is the discussion of each of these estimates:

	profit before tax and segment net profit. Segment net revenue is a measure of profitability defined as the segment revenues less segment direct costs, which include the same items as the &#147;Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and
	amortization)&#148; as reported in the Group&#146;s consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except for payroll costs. Payroll costs are excluded because, although required to maintain the Group&#146;s distribution network, they are not

	exchange gain/(loss) from revaluation of cash proceeds received from secondary public offering, effect from disposal of subsidiaries and fair value adjustments amortization and impairment thereof, as well as non-recurring items.

	The Group determined the following CGUs: JSC QIWI, Visa QIWI Wallet, Rapida LTD and considers goodwill relates to the group of three CGUs. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 carrying amount of goodwill was equal to 6,285,235 (1,631,406 for 2014 and 2013). For the purpose of goodwill impairment test the Company estimated the recoverable amounts of group of three CGUs&nbsp;as fair value less costs
	of disposal on the basis of quoted prices of Company&#146;s ordinary shares (Level 1). As result of annual impairment test the Group did not identify any impairment as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015.

	For the purpose of intangible assets with indefinite useful life impairment test the Company estimated the recoverable amounts of each asset&nbsp;as fair
	value less costs of disposal on the basis of comparative method and cost approach. Under the valuation using the comparative method the Group considered similar third-parties transactions for acquisition of banks or bank organization that holds
	licenses identical to the Group&#146;s ones. Under the valuation using the cost approach the Group considered outflows required to meet the requirements for a minimum amount of equity to be held by the bank or bank organization with licenses similar
	to the Group ones according to current legislation (Level 3).

	During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 the Group used overdraft credit facilities with
	an overall credit limit of 2,060,000, with maturity from May 2017 to January 2018, and interest rate up to 30%&nbsp;per annum. Balance payable under these credit lines as at December&nbsp;31, 2015 was zero. Some of these agreements stipulated the

	Russia continues economic reforms and development of its legal, tax and regulatory frameworks as required by a market economy. The future stability of the
	Russian economy is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures undertaken by the government.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the past few years, the Russian economy has been negatively impacted by a significant drop in crude oil prices and a significant devaluation of the Russian
	Ruble, as well as restrictive measures imposed against the Russian Federation by several countries. In December 2014, the Ruble interest rates have increased significantly after the Central Bank of Russia raised its key rate to 17% (slightly
	decreased in the first quarter of 2015 to 14%, to 11.5% in the second quarter and to 11% in the third quarter). The combination of the above resulted in reduced access to capital, a higher cost of capital, increased inflation and uncertainty
	regarding economic growth, which could negatively affect the Group&#146;s future financial position, results of operations and business prospects. Management believes it is taking appropriate measures to support the sustainability of the
	Group&#146;s business in the current circumstances.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, following the accession of Crimea to Russia, which is seen by the EU as an illegal
	annexation of Crimea, the Company&#146;s Russian subsidiaries started operating in that region with a limited number of kiosks. On December&nbsp;19, 2014, U.S. President Obama signed a new executive order imposing comprehensive sanctions on the
	Crimea region. Almost all transactions involving a U.S. person or that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction and that directly or indirectly involve an individual or entity in Crimea are prohibited, with the exception of certain transactions involving
	certain agricultural commodities, medicine and medical devices. The executive order also permits the designation of persons that operate in Crimea, leaders of entities operating in Crimea, entities that are owned or controlled by a person that is
	designated by the&nbsp;Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), or persons that provide material assistance or financial, material, or technological support to a person that is designated by OFAC. The EU has similarly introduced a broad set of
	sanctions inter alia: an investment ban prohibiting to acquire new or extend any existing participation or ownership of real estate located in Crimea or Sevastopol, acquire new or extend any existing participation or ownership or control of an
	entity in Crimea or Sevastopol, provide financing to an entity in Crimea or Sevastopol, create any joint venture in Crimea or Sevastopol or with an entity in Crimea or Sevastopol or provide investment services directly related to the above
	activities; an embargo on certain listed goods and technology that are suited for the key sectors of transport, telecommunications, energy and mining; and an import ban on goods originating from Crimea and Sevastopol and on financial assistance as
	well as insurance and reinsurance related to such import.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To date, the management does not believe that any of the current sanctions as in force limit
	the Group&#146;s ability to operate in Crimea. Nevertheless, any new or expanded sanctions that may be imposed on Russian businesses operating in Crimea by the U.S., EU, or other countries may materially adversely affect the Group and any future
	plans the Group may have to expand in that region.

	In light of the hardening geopolitical situation in Ukraine, the United States of America, the European Union
	and other countries have adopted a package of economic restrictive measures imposing certain sanctions on the operations of various Russian banks, including VTB Bank and Gazprombank. Some subsidiaries of the Company hold bank accounts in the
	aforementioned banks as well as have credit lines and bank guarantees in VTB Bank. Management is monitoring these developments in the current environment and taking actions where appropriate. These and any further possible negative developments in
	Ukraine could adversely impact results and financial position of the Group in a manner not currently determinable.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Further, the management sees several
	risks that can affect the stability and profitability of the Group offline distribution business. Firstly, the overall macroeconomic conditions adversely affect the purchasing power of Russian population as high inflation combined with decreasing
	real wage put pressure on the disposable income, thus leading to the overall decrease in consumer spending and in turn the Group&#146;s payment volumes. Secondly, the agents&#146; economics is being pressured by decreasing commissions (including and
	most significantly mobile network operators) and higher customer commission sensitivity combined with high rental and other costs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, CBR has been
	recently taking steps to secure the quality and transparency of agents industry, thus imposing some additional controls and monitoring requirements on agents through the banks. As agents have to comply with more requirements and handle significantly
	increasing numbers of inquiries from the banks that they work with, additional pressure is put on the agents&#146; business model especially for smaller players. Although the Group&#146;s network of agents remains well diversified the
	above-mentioned changes have negatively affected the size of Group&#146;s physical distribution in Russia and, correspondingly, pressured its financial results. The Management is committed to make its best effort to support Group&#146;s agents and
	mitigate negative effects of the discussed market conditions however, at the moment they cannot be sure if there will be any further negative impact of these changes in the mid-term.

	Russian and the CIS&#146;s tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently.
	Management&#146;s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities. Recent events within Russia and the CIS which are discussed below
	suggest that the tax authorities are taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments and as a result, it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may be
	challenged.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Due to its international structure, the Group is subject to transfer pricing and permanent establishment risks in various jurisdictions it
	operates in. Since January, 2012, the Russian tax authorities have the right to apply transfer pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities in respect of &#147;controlled&#148; transactions, if the transaction price differs from the
	market price. The Russian transfer pricing legislation grants taxpayers the right to justify their compliance with the arm&#146;s length principle at prices used in controlled transactions by preparing the transfer pricing documentation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group manages the related risks by looking at its management functions and risks in various countries and level of profits allocated to each subsidiary.
	The list of &#147;controlled&#148; transactions of the Group includes various transactions between different Russian entities as well as certain types of cross-border transactions. The Group determines its tax liabilities arising from
	&#147;controlled&#148; transactions using actual transaction prices.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Currently the tax authorities perform tax audits of many Russian taxpayers with
	major focus on compliance with new transfer pricing legislation. It is therefore possible that the Group entities may become subject to transfer pricing tax audits by tax authorities in the near future. The Russian tax authorities may challenge the
	level of prices applied by the Group under the &#147;controlled&#148; transactions (including certain intercompany transactions) and accrue additional tax liabilities. If additional taxes are assessed with respect to these matters, they may be
	material. This risk may increase in the future as Russian transfer pricing practice develops.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Management believes that the Group is able to prove the
	arms&#146; length nature of prices with respect to the &#147;controlled&#148; transactions, and that there has been proper reporting to the Russian tax authorities, supported by appropriate available transfer pricing documentation.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	According to the provisions of the Cyprus Income Tax Law, a company is considered to be a resident of Cyprus for tax purposes if its management and control
	are exercised in Cyprus. The concept of &#147;management and control&#148; is not defined in the Cypriot tax legislation. However, the Cyprus Tax Authorities have published documents which indicate the minimum requirements that need to be satisfied
	for a company to be considered a tax resident of Cyprus (among others the place of incorporation of the company and its tax residency only in Cyprus, the place where the company&#146;s executive bodies operate). Taking into consideration that the
	majority of the board of directors is comprised of tax residents of Russia, the shareholders&#146; meetings took place in Russia and a number of other factors which may be treated as not fully in line with the abovementioned requirements, our tax
	residency in Cyprus may be challenged by the relevant tax authorities. Moreover, we may be deemed not to be a tax resident in Cyprus due to the implication of the Russian laws, described below. If we are tax resident in a jurisdiction outside of
	Cyprus or are deemed to have a permanent establishment in Russia or elsewhere, our tax burden may increase significantly, which, in turn, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	activities, as well as approach to taxation of controlled foreign companies. It is currently unclear how the Russian tax authorities will interpret and apply the new tax provisions and what will be the possible impact on the Group. Therefore, it
	cannot be excluded that Group&#146;s companies might be subject to additional tax liabilities because of these changes being introduced and applied to transactions carried out by them, which could have a material adverse effect on Group&#146;s
	business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group&#146;s management is undertaking all necessary and required measures in order to minimize the potential negative impact of the &#147;de-offshorization&#148; legislation.

	Kazakhstan issues

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April 2012 the Group&#146;s
	subsidiary in Kazakhstan were included in the state register of market participants with dominant or monopoly position in Kazakhstan. Entities included in this register are prohibited from performing actions that may have a detrimental effect on
	competition, restrict access to the market or infringe the rights of consumers, including predatory or discriminatory pricing, unjustified resale restrictions, imposing unreasonable terms, or refusing to supply or halting supplies for unjustified
	reasons. Status as a dominant market participant also puts an entity under much more stringent scrutiny from the Competition Protection Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, or the Competition Protection Agency, therefore increasing the probability
	of being investigated and penalized if a violation occurs. As a result, the Competition Protection Agency may impose restrictions on the Group&#146;s operations, or take other measures that may be inconsistent with the Group&#146;s strategy. The
	maximum liability to which the Group can be exposed is a penalty equal to 10% of the revenue earned as a result of market abuse, plus confiscation of the full amount of such revenue. The maximum liability is determined in reference to not more than
	one year of such revenues. For the past years, the Group&#146;s subsidiary in Kazakhstan was subject to an investigation concerning alleged abuse of its dominant position in Kazakhstan&#146;s electronic payments market and received various requests
	from the anti-trust authorities for information related to its business. The Group has complied with the orders and requests and have taken all necessary and required actions to remedy the detected violations. However, management cannot exclude
	similar investigations to recur in the future, and cannot reliably estimate the amounts of claims that can be brought against the Group in connection with these investigations. Moreover if any limitations are introduced in connection with this, they
	may reduce the Group&#146;s operational and commercial flexibility and responsiveness, which may adversely affect the Group&#146;s business, financial condition and results of operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the end of the year 2014, the Group&#146;s subsidiary became subject to financial monitoring legislation in Kazakhstan, imposing certain client
	identification requirements on it. In connection with such legislation, the management had to restructure operations in Kazakhstan to make the Kazakh subsidiary, instead of a Russian one, the operator of Group payment system in the country which was
	completed in September 2015. As the anti-money laundering legislation in Kazakhstan is relatively nascent and yet undeveloped, the management faced various difficulties while applying it. Currently the Kazakh subsidiary and other participants of
	electronic money market in Kazakhstan cooperate with the local authorities in order to clarify the existing legislative gaps to ensure proper functioning of anti-money laundering procedures in Kazakhstan. However, if management is not able to do so
	or if the subsidiary is not able to comply with the new legislation for any other reason, it could become subject to regulatory action in Kazakhstan and could face fines or significant restrictions on its business operations in the country.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group&#146;s business is currently subject to know-your-client- requirements established by Federal Law of the Russian Federation No.&nbsp;115-FZ &#147;On
	Combating the Legalization (Laundering) of Criminally Obtained Income and Funding of Terrorism&#148;, dated August&nbsp;7, 2001, as amended, or the Anti-Money Laundering Law. Based on the Anti-Money Laundering Law management distinguishes three
	types of consumers based on their level of identification, being anonymous, identified through a simplified procedure and fully identified. The consumers who have not undergone any identification procedure are qualified as anonymous and are not
	allowed to contemplate transactions as well as hold an electronic money account balance in excess of RUB15,000. The consumers who have undergone simplified identification procedure with the payment services provider are entitled to perform
	electronic money transfers in excess of RUB15,000 provided that at any point of time the account balance of electronic money does not exceed RUB60,000 and the total amount of transactions does not exceed RUB 200,000&nbsp;per month. Fully identified
	consumers are entitled to perform same type of electronic transfers as consumers identified through a simplified procedure but with increased threshold of the electronic money account balance of RUB 600,000 and no limitations for the total
	transaction amount per month. The key difference between the simplified and the full identification procedures is that the simplified identification can be performed remotely. The remote identification requires the verification of certain data
	provided by consumers against public databases. Albeit a government order No.&nbsp;630 dated July&nbsp;8, 2014, was enacted providing that public databases shall be set up by specific government authorities and access to them shall be granted to the
	third parties authorized to carry out identification of consumers, such databases are not yet up and running at scale and, to the knowledge of the Group, there is no work in progress on setting up such databases. Thus, current situation could cause
	the Group to be in violation of the identification requirements. In case management is enforced not to use the simplified identification procedure until the databases are fully running, it could negatively affect the number of consumers and,
	consequently, volumes and revenues.

	In May 2015 the CBR finished a scheduled inspection of Rapida LTD, as a result of which various breaches were uncovered and a range of restrictions were

	implemented to ensure compliance by the agents with legislation that requires them to remit their proceeds to special accounts. As a result, a range of restrictions were imposed on the operations of Rapida LTD the compliance with which is at times
	problematic since it requires full compliance by Rapida LTD agents with the enhanced measures adopted by the CBR, which is beyond our control. After the acquisition, we began implementing compliance and internal control procedures in Rapida LTD
	aimed to rectify the detected violations and to prevent them in future. There can be no assurance that such measures will be successful.

	The macroeconomic slowdown in Russia, caused among other things by dropping oil prices and sanctions regime,
	which effectively limited the access to liquidity of the key Russian banks led to liquidity shortage in the market the Group operates. This exacerbated the liquidity shortage on the market. As a consequence, banks and entities in Russia
	substantially decreased credit limits in their everyday operations. Management noted that the Group&#146;s merchants and partners started since the end of 2014 to request from the Group larger collaterals to hedge their risks. The Group was able to
	manage these new requirements to date, though the liquidity shortage in the market may further exacerbate and consequently it may have further negative effects on Group&#146; operations which cannot be now reliably estimated.

	and send the report to CBR on a monthly basis. During the year 2015 QIWI Bank JSC and Rapida LTD met the capital adequacy requirements. During the year 2014 QIWI Bank JSC breached the capital adequacy ratio set by instruction of the CBR with no

	Capital includes share capital, share premium, additional paid-in capital, other reserves and translation reserve. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may make dividend payments to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or
	issue new shares. Currently, the Group requires capital to finance its growth, but it generates sufficient cash from its operations. The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Company&#146;s financial liabilities based on contractual

	Financial assets, which potentially subject the Group and its subsidiaries and associates to credit risk, consist principally of trade receivables, loans
	receivable issued, cash and short-term investments. The Group sells services on a prepayment basis or ensures that its receivables are from customers with an appropriate credit history &#150; large merchants and agents with sufficient and
	appropriate credit history. The Group&#146;s receivables from merchants and others, except for agents, are generally non-interest-bearing and do not require collateral. Receivables and loans from agents are interest-bearing and unsecured. The Group
	holds cash primarily with reputable Russian and international banks, including CBR, which management considers having minimal risk of default, although credit ratings of Russian and Kazakh banks are generally lower than those of the banks in more
	developed markets. Short-term investments include fixed-rate debt instruments issued by the top Russian banks.

	In October, 2012 the board of directors and shareholders approved an Employee
	Stock Ownership Plan (&#147;ESOP&#148;) for management of the Group, under which up to 2,565,000 shares of the Company can be granted to management during the ten years of the plan term. Later in January 2013, the Company&#146;s ESOP was amended and
	restated to increase the maximum amount of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan to 3,640,000 class B shares, or 7% of the Company entire issued and outstanding share capital. Vesting is individually agreed for each grant. The contractual term
	of the options granted is 10 years from the date of grant. The board of directors shall determine the exercise price applicable to the options granted under the ESOP. Following an initial public offering of the Group, the exercise price shall not be
	less than the average closing price of the shares on the principal exchange on which such shares are then traded for the ten business days immediately preceding the grant date. The options can be exercised on a gross or net share basis. Upon
	exercise, one half of shares cannot be sold or otherwise transferred until after the Group achieve a net income target per the Group&#146;s management accounts (prepared on a basis consistent with the basis of preparation of segment data) of
	5,359,284 for the 12 month period immediately preceding the applicable measurement date.

	The expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of peer companies. The share price for
	options granted on December&nbsp;21, 2012 was determined using the discounted cash flows projections based on financial budgets approved by the Group&#146;s senior management covering an eight-year period (2013-2020). An eight-year period was used
	for projections, as the Group considers this time frame to be reasonably forecasted. The share price for options granted after IPO was determined by reference to closing market prices of the Group&#146;s traded shares. Due to lack of historical
	data, the expected life of the options was estimated as a mid-point average between the vesting and the expiration date of each option vesting tranche.
