	We have prepared our

	derived from our audited financial statements which are not included in this Annual Report. For the year ended December 31,
	2015, we have included the results of CynoGen, Inc. as of April 13, 2015, the acquisition date. Further details on the
	acquisition of CynoGen, Inc. can be found in Section 4.B. below. In July 2008, through our wholly owned subsidiary
	Rosetta Genomics Inc., we purchased Parkway Clinical Laboratories, Inc., a privately held Pennsylvania corporation owning
	a CLIA-certified laboratory. Parkway remained an indirect wholly owned subsidiary until we sold it in May 2009. On April
	18, 2013, we signed a settlement agreement with Sanra Laboratories (&ldquo;Sanra&rdquo;) in connection with our sale of
	Parkway to Sanra. Under the terms of the agreement, on April 20, 2013 and on May 10, 2013, Sanra and Parkway paid us a total
	of $625,000. Operating results for Parkway have been classified as discontinued operations for all presented periods.

	We have

	substantial additional funds to continue our operations. Following our acquisition of PersonalizeDx in 2015, we have incurred

<FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	As of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term bank
	deposits and restricted cash of $13.5 million, compared to $15.6 million as of December 31, 2014. Our current operating plan
	includes various assumptions concerning the level and timing of cash receipts from sales and cash outlays for operating
	expenses and capital expenditures. Our ability to successfully carry out our business plan is primarily dependent upon our
	ability to (1) obtain sufficient additional capital, (2) attract and retain knowledgeable employees, (3) increase our cash
	collections and (4) generate significant additional revenues. We believe that our existing operating plan,&nbsp;which
	includes a cost-reduction plan should we be unable to raise sufficient additional capital, will be sufficient to fund our
	operations for at least the next 12 months. We may seek additional funding through collaborative
	arrangements and public or private equity offerings and debt financings, and we may elect to raise additional funds even
	before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. Additional funds may not be available to us when
	needed on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the
	rights of our existing shareholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, further dilution
	to our then-existing shareholders may result. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could
	limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may
	be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs. We also could be required to seek
	funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies,
	tests or products in development or approved tests or products that we would otherwise pursue on our own. Our failure to
	raise capital when needed will materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	Furthermore, the standards that the U.S. Patent
	and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly
	and may change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable
	in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. Furthermore, the field of microRNAs is new and developing. Accordingly, there is significant
	uncertainty about what patents will be issued, and what their claims may cover. It is likely that there will be significant litigation
	and other proceedings, such as interference proceedings and opposition proceedings, in certain patent offices, relating to patent
	rights in the microRNA field. Others may attempt to invalidate our intellectual property rights. Currently, there is an opposition
	proceeding pending against one of our patents in Europe. This opposition relates to a patent granted by the European Patent Office
	that claims the use of miR-34a for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer, wherein the cancer is p53
	negative. Even if this opposition is successful, we do not anticipate that the result will have an adverse effect on our business.

	issued to us or to others. Additionally, the mere issuance of a patent does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable, so even

	In addition, we cannot be certain that we hold
	the rights to the technology covered by our pending patent applications or to other proprietary technology required for us to commercialize
	our proposed tests and products. Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents issue, and because certain
	applications will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by
	our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority
	over those applications. For this and other reasons, we may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing desired exclusivity.
	Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we will need a license. If those organizations
	refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms, we will not be able to market our tests and products.

	From time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court, other federal courts,
	the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our
	business. There have been several cases involving &ldquo;gene patents&rdquo; and diagnostic claims that have been considered by
	the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 13, 2013, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. the Court held that claims
	to isolated genomic DNA were not patentable subject matter, but claims to complementary DNA (cDNA) molecules were patentable subject
	matter. The effect of the decision on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain, and this uncertainty includes microRNAs,
	which have a different chemical composition, differ in size, and have a more complicated discovery process than DNA. On March 20,
	2012, in Mayo Collaborative Services, DBA Mayo Medical Laboratories, et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Court held that
	several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable
	subject matter. Although the decision relates to biomarker method patents, relating to simple methods, for affecting treatment
	decisions, the decision has created uncertainty around the ability to patent certain biomarker-related method patents. On June
	12, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) issued a decision in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom,
	Inc. The decision dealt with the subject matter eligibility of a non-invasive method for detecting paternally inherited cell-free
	fetal DNA from a blood sample of the pregnant woman carrying a fetus. The district court ruled that the method claims were patent
	ineligible and the Federal Circuit agreed. In December 2015, the CAFC denied an
<I>
	en banc
</I>
	hearing of this case. These decisions
	have increased the uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future as well as the value of current and future
	patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. federal courts and the Patent Office, the interpretation of laws and
	regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce
	our existing patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

	On December 15th, 2014, the USPTO released the revised subject matter
	eligibility examination guidance to patent examiners entitled &quot; 2014 Interim Guidance on Patent Subject Matter Eligibility
	&quot; (the &quot;Interim Guidance&quot;). The Interim Guidance intends to assist USPTO patent examiners to evaluate inventions
	that may be related to law of nature, natural phenomena, and/or an abstract idea. The Interim Guidance addresses the concerns raised
	by the public against the guidance issued in March of 2014 &ndash; namely that the USPTO applied with too broad a brush the recent
	Supreme Court decisions regarding the judicial exceptions (law of nature, natural phenomena, and/or an abstract idea). The USPTO&rsquo;s
	new analysis, focusing on the claims as a whole and an analysis of the &ldquo;markedly different&rdquo; properties of the claimed
	subject matter (as compared to the natural counterpart product) is a balanced approach. The Interim Guidance also appears to indicate
	that a claim that recites a natural phenomenon, such as a diagnostic process or method, will satisfy Section 101 if the claim sufficiently
	limits the practical application of the natural phenomenon. The USPTO issued another update in July 2015 to provide additional
	information for subject matter eligibility. While we believe our patents and pending patent applications include claims that are
	patentable under current US law, as well as in foreign jurisdictions, no assurances can be given that a federal district court
	or the USPTO would agree.

	In addition, Congress has directed the USPTO to study effective
	ways to provide independent, confirming genetic diagnostic test activity where gene patents and exclusive licensing for primary
	genetic diagnostic tests exist. This study will examine the impact that independent second opinion testing has on providing medical
	care to patients; the effect that providing independent second opinion genetic diagnostic testing would have on the existing patent
	and license holders of an exclusive genetic test; the impact of current practices on testing results and performance; and the role
	of insurance coverage on the provision of genetic diagnostic tests. The USPTO was directed to report the findings of the study
	to Congress and provide recommendations for establishing the availability of independent confirming genetic diagnostic test activity
	by June 16, 2012. On August 28, 2012, the Department of Commerce sent a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary Committee leadership
	updating them on the status of the genetic testing report. The letter stated in part: &ldquo;Given the complexity and diversity
	of the opinions, comments, and suggestions provided by interested parties, and the important policy considerations involved, we
	believe that further review, discussion, and analysis are required before a final report can be submitted to Congress.&rdquo; The
	USPTO issued a Request for Comments and Notice of Public Hearing on Genetic Diagnostic Testing on January 25, 2012, and held additional
	public hearings in February and March 2013. In September 2015, the USPTO submitted a report to Congress pursuant to Section 27
	of the Leahy Smith America Invents Act. The report stated that in view of the altered legal landscape, the USPTO&rsquo;s recommendations
	to Congress are limited in scope. The report provided three recommendations. The first recommendation was to proceed cautiously,
	monitoring changes in the actual availability of gene-based diagnostic tests from multiple providers. The second recommendation
	was to consider creating mechanisms to facilitate sharing data on diagnostic correlations in order to build robust databases of
	the relationships between genetic mutations and the presence, absence, or likelihood of acquiring the relevant medical condition.
	The third recommendation was to consider the role of cost and insurance. It is unclear whether the recommendations of this study
	will be acted upon by Congress to change the law or process in a manner that could negatively impact our patent portfolio or our
	future research and development efforts.

	Although the FDA has consistently stated that
	it has the authority to regulate clinical laboratory tests as medical devices, it generally exercised enforcement discretion in
	not otherwise regulating most tests such as ours that are designed, manufactured and used within the high complexity CLIA-certified
	laboratory at which the test was performed. These tests are known as laboratory developed tests or LDTs. However, after many years
	of promising that it would be providing guidance on the regulation of LDTs, the FDA issued draft guidance entitled, &ldquo;Framework
	for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)&rdquo; and an accompanying draft guidance document, or Draft Guidance,
	entitled, &ldquo;FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)&rdquo; on October 3 2014.
	If the Draft Guidance is finalized, the FDA may phase-in a risk-based approach to the regulation of LDTs in a manner that is consistent
	with the FDA&rsquo;s current regulation of in vitro diagnostics, or IVDs, which means that new LDTs could be subject to requirements
	for premarket review. We cannot predict when or whether the Draft Guidance will be finalized, but we are monitoring this development
	carefully. Although we intend to continue to launch new clinical tests as LDTs in our CLIA-certified laboratory, we cannot provide
	any assurance that FDA regulations, including pre-market clearance or approval, will not be required in the future for LDTs applying
	our microRNA technology. If pre-market clearance or approval, or additional legal requirements such as implementing additional
	quality controls, are required, our business could be negatively impacted because we would have to obtain the data required to
	support the requirements of new FDA regulations and because our CLIA-certified laboratory may be required to stop offering our
	tests until they are cleared or approved by the FDA.

	laws and foreign laws protecting the privacy and security of identifiable health information, or &ldquo;protected health information&rdquo;
	as defined under HIPAA, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected health information that we are subject to. In
	the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated health information privacy and security rules under
	the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and then significantly strengthened and broadened the applicability
	of HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HIPAA and HITECH and their implementing
	regulations and guidance will be collectively referred to herein as &ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;. HIPAA applies to health care providers
	engaging in certain standard transactions electronically; health plans and health care clearing houses. These entities are referred
	to as &ldquo;covered entities.&rdquo; Certain HIPAA provisions also apply to &ldquo;business associates&rdquo; of covered entities,
	or third party providers of services to covered entities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. HIPAA&rsquo;s
	privacy rules protect medical records and protected health information in all forms by limiting its use and disclosure, giving
	individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting, in some circumstances,
	the use and disclosure of protected health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose
	of the use or disclosure. HIPAA&rsquo;s security standards require both covered entities and business associates to implement administrative,
	physical and technical security measures to maintain the security of protected health information in electronic form. Covered entities
	and business associates must conduct initial and ongoing risk assessments to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of security measures
	and maintain a written information security plan. HITECH amended HIPAA to require the reporting of breaches of protected health
	information to affected individuals, the federal government and in some cases, to the media. We are a covered entity and as such,
	we must comply with HIPAA and ensure that all aspects of our operations comply with relevant HIPAA standards. For example, we must
	take steps to ensure that our sales team does not inappropriately access or use protected health information in providing services
	and support to customers. We are subject to random audit by federal authorities, and enforcement by both state and federal regulators.
	We are also subject to investigation in response to complaints. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules security
	standards, breach notification rules or other HIPAA requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties as well as
	fines, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business. Large breaches of protected health information
	could lead to class action lawsuits and other litigation. Any publicly reported breach could cause significant reputational harm
	to our business and significant expense for reporting, mitigation of harm and implementation of corrective actions mandated by
	regulators. HITECH expanded HIPAA enforcement authority to state attorneys general, so we are subject to additional enforcement
	and penalties from each state where individuals affected by a HIPAA violation may reside. Allegations that we have violated individuals&rsquo;
	privacy or security rights, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in
	adverse publicity that could harm our business. Beyond HIPAA, most states have adopted data security laws protecting the personal
	data of state residents. Personal data subject to protection typically includes name coupled with social security number, state-issued
	identification number, or financial account number. Most states require specific, technical security measures for the protection
	of all personal data, including employee data, and impose their own breach notification requirements in the event of a loss of
	personal data. Many states have also adopted genetic testing and privacy laws. These laws typically require a specific, written
	consent for genetic testing, as well as consent for the disclosure of genetic test results, and otherwise limit uses and disclosures
	of genetic testing results. A few states have adopted laws that give their residents property rights in their genetic information.
	State privacy and data security laws generally overlap and apply simultaneously with HIPAA. In the event of a data breach affecting
	individuals from more than one state, we must comply with all relevant state notification requirements as well as HIPAA and are
	subject to enforcement by all relevant state and federal authorities as well as fines and penalties imposed by each state. Non-U.S.
	privacy protection requirements such as the European Union&rsquo;s Data Protection Directive governing the processing of personal
	data, may be stricter than U.S. law and violations could result in claims for damages, fines or orders to stop or change the processing
	of the personal data. The European Union&rsquo;s final draft General Data Protection Regulation, which is likely to be formally
	adopted, imposes extensive new legal obligations and substantially increases the risk of fines, with upper limits based on a corporate
	group&rsquo;s global turnover. Privacy and data security laws, including those relating to health information, are complex, overlapping
	and rapidly evolving. All of these laws impact our business either directly or indirectly. Our failure to comply with applicable
	privacy or security laws, or significant changes in these laws, could significantly impact our business and future business plans.

	In the United States, private and government
	payors decide whether to cover a new diagnostic test, the amount that they will pay for a covered test and the specific conditions
	for reimbursement. In May 2012, we announced that the designated Medicare Administrative Contractor, or MAC, with jurisdiction
	for the
<FONT STYLE="BACKGROUND-COLOR: WHITE">

</FONT>
	Test had informed us that it plans to cover this test for
	Medicare beneficiaries, and in June 2012, we announced that the MAC had established a reimbursement rate for the test. We then
	announced that this MAC had formalized their coverage decision in a Local Coverage Determination (LCD) effective August 1, 2013.
	Each third-party payor, however, makes its own decision about which tests it will cover and how much it will pay. While many third-party
	payors will follow the lead of Medicare, we cannot provide any assurance that other payors will cover this test or any of our
	other tests. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific
	and clinical support for the use of each of our tests to each payor separately, with no assurance that approval will be obtained.
	Furthermore, reimbursement from third party payors depends upon whether a service is covered under the patient&rsquo;s policy
	and if payment practices for the service have been established. If third-party payors decide not to cover our diagnostic tests
	or if Medicare or other payors offer inadequate payment amounts, our ability to generate revenue from our diagnostic tests could
	be limited. Third-party payors that decide to reimburse for our tests may stop or lower payment at any time, which would reduce
	revenue. We cannot predict whether third-party payors will cover our tests or offer adequate payments. We also cannot predict
	the timing of such decisions. In addition, physicians or patients may decide not to order our tests if third-party payments are
	inadequate, especially if ordering the test could result in financial liability for the patient.

	Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, establishes reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules for Medicare,
	and private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently. While we have been assigned a CPT code for the

	In March 2010, the President of the
	United States signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education
	Affordability Reconciliation Act, or the ACA. This law substantially changed the way healthcare will be financed by both
	governmental healthcare programs and private insurers, and has significantly impacted our industry. The ACA contains a number
	of provisions that affect and will continue to affect our business and operations, including those governing enrollment in
	state and federal healthcare programs, Medicare reimbursement, and healthcare fraud and abuse.

	The Protecting Access to Medicare Act
	of 2014, or PAMA, which was signed into law on April 1, 2014, significantly altered the current payment methodology for
	clinical diagnostic laboratory services covered by the Medicare Part B program and paid according to the Clinical Laboratory
	Fee Schedule, or CLFS.&nbsp;Under PAMA, applicable laboratories must report rates paid by private payors (i.e., health
	insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicaid managed care organizations) for each clinical
	diagnostic laboratory test, or CDLT, that it furnished during the data collection period.&nbsp; The reported data must
	include payment rates (reflecting all discounts, rebates, coupons and other price concessions), Healthcare Common Procedure
	Coding System codes, and the volume of tests associated with each rate. The CLFS payment rate for each CDLT (with some
	exceptions) will be equal to the weighted median, as calculated based on the data submitted by applicable laboratories.&nbsp;
	Every three years new data will be submitted, and new rates for CDLTs will be established based on that
	data.&nbsp;Significant reductions in reimbursement would be phased in over time. CMS would limit the maximum reimbursement
	reduction for a particular CDLT to no more than 10% each year in 2017 through 2019 and no more than 15% each year in 2020
	through 2022.&nbsp;PAMA required publication of a final rule by June 15, 2015, submission of initial payment data on January
	1, 2016, and implementation of new CLFS payment rates as of January 1, 2017.&nbsp;CMS did not publish a proposed rule until
	October 1, 2015, and has yet to issue a final rule.&nbsp; Whether CMS will implement new payment rates as of January 1, 2017,
	as required by PAMA, is therefore unknown at this time.&nbsp;

	Diagnostic tests furnished to Medicare inpatients generally
	are included in the bundled payment made to the hospital under Medicare Part A&rsquo;s Inpatient Prospective Payment System. Further,
	in 2014, CMS began to bundle payment for clinical laboratory tests together with other services performed during hospital outpatient
	visits under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System. While CMS exempted molecular diagnostic tests from this packaging
	provision, it is possible that CMS could propose to bundle payment for such tests in the future. Our tests are generally not paid
	in the hospital outpatient setting, and insofar as they are paid in that setting they likely would be considered molecular tests
	if billed under specific procedure codes, but it is possible that payment for our tests could be bundled if furnished in a hospital
	outpatient setting in the future.

	On several occasions Congress has considered various cost reduction alternatives, including imposing a
	20% co-insurance amount on clinical laboratory services (which would require beneficiaries to pay a portion of the cost of their
	clinical laboratory testing). Although these changes have not been enacted at this time, Congress could decide to impose these
	or other fee reductions or taxes at some point in the future. If so, these additional coinsurance payments for our tests could
	be difficult to collect and any new fee reductions or taxes would impact our revenues

	We expect that there will continue to
	be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to keep healthcare costs
	down. Some of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our tests or the
	amounts of payment available for our tests from governmental healthcare programs or third-party payors. Current and future

	We believe we may be a PFIC for the year ended
	December 31, 2015. The determination of whether or not we are a PFIC is made on an annual basis and will depend on the composition
	of our income and assets from time to time. Specifically, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will generally be classified
	as a PFIC for any taxable year in which either: (i) 75% or more of our gross income is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the
	average value (determined on a quarterly basis) of our total assets for the taxable year (including cash) produce or are held for
	the production of passive income. The calculation of the value of our assets will be based, in part, on the quarterly market value
	of our ordinary shares. It is difficult to make accurate predictions of our future income, assets, activities and market capitalization,
	all of which are relevant to the PFIC determination. For years in which we are determined to be a PFIC for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes, U.S. holders of our ordinary shares may become subject to increased tax liabilities under U.S. tax laws and regulations
	and will become subject to burdensome reporting requirements. Accordingly, our treatment as a PFIC could therefore result in a
	reduction in the after-tax return of U.S. holders of our ordinary shares and may cause a reduction in the value of our shares.

	Furthermore, Israeli tax considerations may

	makes the deferral contingent on the fulfillment of numerous conditions, including a holding period of two years from the date
	of the transaction during which sales and dispositions of shares of the participating companies are restricted. Moreover, with

	In addition, under the rules and regulations
	of The NASDAQ Stock Market, a foreign private issuer may follow its home country practice in lieu of certain NASDAQ listing requirements.
	For example, under NASDAQ&rsquo;s rules, each of (1) the private placement completed in December 2010, (2) the concurrent private
	placement and registered direct offering completed in February 2011, (3) the private placement completed in October 2011, (4) the
	Debenture transaction completed in January 2012, (5) the registered direct offering completed in April 2012, (6) the registered
	direct offerings completed in May 2012 and (7) the private placement completed in October 2015, would have required shareholder
	approval because these offerings represented the issuance (or potential issuance) of more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary
	shares at a price per share below the greater of book value per share or market value per share. However, we chose to follow our
	home country practice, which did not require shareholder approval of these offerings. Because of these SEC and NASDAQ exemptions,
	investors are not afforded the same protections or information generally available to investors holding shares in public companies
	organized in the United States. See also &ldquo;Item 16G Corporate Governance.&rdquo;

	Rosetta Genomics was founded in 2000 with the
	belief that what was known as &ldquo;junk DNA&rdquo; actually contains hundreds, possibly thousands, of tiny RNA genes that encode
	small RNA molecules, later termed microRNAs, which play an important role in the regulation of protein production, and hence the
	onset and progression of disease. In the cell, genes are expressed through information carried from our DNA by messenger RNAs,
	or mRNAs, which is in turn translated into proteins. Proteins are the building blocks of all living cells. The type of cell, its
	function, and the timing of its death are determined by which proteins are produced in the cell, and at what quantities and time
	they are produced. However, the proteins are the end product of a complex process, which begins with the genetic code present in
	DNA. Before a protein is expressed, or produced, relevant parts of the DNA are copied into a mRNA. Each mRNA holds a code with
	instructions on how to build a specific protein using a process called translation. Although one messenger RNA molecule is capable
	of translating hundreds of thousands of protein molecules, the number it actually produces is regulated by microRNAs. MicroRNAs
	have been found to regulate the expression of other genes by binding to the mRNA.

	To leverage the potential of microRNAs as a novel diagnostic platform, we have developed proprietary methods to extract microRNAs
	from a wide range of tissue and body fluid samples and to quantify specific microRNA expression signatures, which may be used
	as diagnostic panels to potentially diagnose cancers, their subtypes, as well as the origin of metastases. We have already developed
	and launched a number of diagnostic tests based on our platforms and have published several papers demonstrating how our methods
	can be used to develop such diagnostics (e.g. Rosenwald et al.,

	We believe that using microRNAs as diagnostic
	biomarkers will enable the development of diagnostic products that can provide more accurate and comprehensive information to
	doctors and patients. Currently, many diagnostic tests are designed to detect abnormal levels of messenger RNAs or proteins. We
	believe microRNA-based tests have the potential to be superior to these tests because it is believed that microRNAs are closer
	to the biological origin of disease and many studies have shown their involvement in disease processes, including the demonstration
	that microRNAs are both diagnostic and prognostic markers. A change in the expression level of a single microRNA may affect the
	activity of dozens of messenger RNA genes, which in turn may affect the level of hundreds of proteins. In addition, microRNAs
	are very tissue specific and very stable in body fluids and tissue samples. Thus, we expect that by focusing our efforts on microRNAs,
	we can develop a less complex biomarker panel. Furthermore, extracting microRNAs from tissue and body fluid samples is more reliable
	than extracting messenger RNAs because of the greater stability of microRNAs. In addition, amplification technologies, such as
	PCR, can potentially increase the sensitivity of a microRNA-based diagnostic test by generating millions of copies of a particular
	microRNA and thereby making it easier for the test to detect the presence of the microRNA. Since amplification technologies cannot
	be used with proteins, we believe microRNA-based diagnostic tests have the potential to be more sensitive than protein-based diagnostic
	tests.

	This test is our second-generation microRNA-based diagnostic for the identification
	of the primary site of metastatic cancer, specifically metastatic cancer of unknown primary
	(CUP). CUP is a heterogeneous group of cancers that constitutes approximately 3-5% of
	all cancers with a poor median survival of six to ten months. It is estimated that over
	50,000 patients in the United States are diagnosed with CUP each year. A patient is typically
	diagnosed with CUP only after undergoing a wide range of tests, including various imaging
	tests such as x-ray, CT, MRI, and PET, which have failed to identify the origin of the
	cancer. Presently, the choice of treatment for metastatic cancer is largely dependent
	on the nature of the primary tumor. Patients with CUP pose a therapeutic dilemma and
	treatment is often empiric with a &ldquo;one treatment fits all&rdquo; approach. In the
	era of rapidly growing effective cytotoxic and targeted therapies for known cancers,
	quicker and more accurate methods to identify the tissue of origin of CUP cancers would
	permit the use of these therapies, thereby improving the chances of achieving a response
	and possibly extending the patient&rsquo;s survival. RosettaGX Cancer Origin

	is able to identify 49 tumor types that include carcinomas, soft tissue tumors, lymphoma
	and other malignancies with very high accuracy.

	&ndash; This is a microRNA-based assay for the diagnosis of indeterminate
	thyroid fine-needle aspirate, or FNA, samples. The test utilizes routinely prepared FNA
	smears to diagnose a cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodule as &ldquo;benign&rdquo;
	or &ldquo;suspicious for malignancy by microRNA&rdquo;. The test also measures a microRNA
	biomarker for medullary carcinoma. The test targets patients with a cytologically indeterminate
	FNA biopsy result estimated to be up to 200,000 people annually in the United States
	alone. FNA biopsy is the most widely used method for diagnosis of thyroid nodules. FNA
	biopsy allows a definitive benign or malignant diagnosis of the majority of tumors, however,
	10-40% of FNAs are classified as cytologically indeterminate. Most patients with cytologically
	indeterminate nodules are referred for partial or complete thyroidectomy, though up to
	70% of these nodules prove to be benign on final surgical pathology.

	For patients with lung
	carcinoma, the accurate determination of tumor type significantly influences treatment decision. In general, SCLC, the main
	sub-type of Neuroendocrine tumors, is much more responsive to chemotherapy and consequently this comprises the mainstay of
	treatment. This is in contrast to NSCLC, which is relatively chemoresistant and thus primarily treated with surgical
	resection for local disease. In addition, the recent emergence of novel biological therapies that effectively target specific
	cellular alterations now demands the most precise classification possible for non-small cell carcinomas. For example, lung
	adenocarcinomas are more likely to respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. erlotinib). Similarly, antibody therapy
	(bevacizumab) directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is more effective in the treatment of
	adenocarcinomas. Not only is bevacizumab less effective in treating squamous cell lung cancers, but the squamous phenotype is
	also associated with much higher rates of life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhage. Thus, the distinction of squamous from
	non-squamous carcinomas is becoming increasingly important. Current methods for differentiating squamous from non-squamous
	NSCLC are not standardized, are difficult to reproduce and have an unacceptable level of variability between pathologists and
	laboratories, as indicated in numerous peer review publications.

</I>
	In May 2012 we launched this microRNA-based kidney tumor
	classification test for pathology samples. This test targets newly diagnosed kidney tumor
	patients, estimated to be 61,560 people in the United States in 2015. Renal cancers account
	for more than 3% of adult malignancies and cause more than 14,000 deaths per year in
	the United States. The test was designed to classify primary kidney tumors into one of
	the four most common types: the malignant renal cell carcinomas clear cell (conventional),
	papillary and chromophobe as well as the benign oncocytoma. These histological subtypes
	vary in their clinical course and their prognosis, and different clinical strategies
	have been developed for their management. In some of the kidney tumor cases it is difficult
	for the pathologist to distinguish between tumor types on the basis of morphology. The
	microRNA-based assay that we have developed is performed by measuring microRNA biomarkers
	in a sample from the tumor. The assay uses the expression of 24 microRNAs to accurately
	identify the kidney tumor subtype.

	are sent to surgery as a precaution, though the majority are benign, exposing patients
	to unnecessary surgical risk and costing the system hundreds of millions of dollars.
	In patients with a malignant nodule, the presence of certain mutations in the BRAF and

	Bladder
	cancer risk stratification-
</I>
	We are seeking to discover tissue-based microRNA biomarkers
	for the purpose of developing a new assay for the risk stratification of patients with
	non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. An estimated 74,000 new cases of bladder cancer are
	expected to occur in 2015 in the United States. At diagnosis, 70-80% of bladder tumors
	are non-muscle invasive, of which 50-80% will have one or several recurrences and 15-25%
	will progress to invasive tumors. Recurrence and progression prediction is currently
	based on clinical and pathological factors including tumor grade and stage and presence
	of concomitant carcinoma in situ (CIS). Since follow-up and treatment regimens depend
	on prognosis, there is a need for accurate stratification of these patients. The assay
	we are seeking to develop has the potential to influence clinical management in a cost
	effective manner, by refining risk stratification and guiding therapy. We have so far
	completed and published two studies that demonstrate the role of microRNAs for risk stratification
	of bladder cancer (Rosenberg et al., 2013 and Segersten et al., 2013). We plan to initiate
	an additional study this year and expect to launch this new assay by the first quarter
	of 2018.

	qRT-PCR platform to characterize microRNAs isolated from those CTCs. In the next phase of the collaboration, we and Biocept will
	test for markers currently offered by us, as well as pursue new markers. This joint proof-of-concept study will initially seek
	to determine whether lung cancer CTCs provide microRNA signatures similar to those from tissue biopsy as previously demonstrated
	by us and in clinical use today. Biocept&rsquo;s technology may allow for the study of tumor cells from a simple blood draw starting
	with the point-of-diagnosis and continuing throughout treatment. This has potential to provide valuable insights when a patient's
	disease progresses while on therapy due to emerging resistance, thus allowing the clinician to plot the optimal next course of
	treatment. MicroRNA analysis can provide unique insight into the biomarker profiles of these cells. We believe that combining current

	Accordingly, microRNA inhibition or replacement has the potential to be a key factor in the treatment of various disease conditions.
	MicroRNA replacement will strive to mimic the natural effect of a down-regulated microRNA in a specific indication. This will

	We have demonstrated this in liver cancer,
	ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer, where differential microRNAs that were shown in tissues of patients were used to find drug
	candidates that could inhibit those cancers through either microRNA inhibition or mimetics. In ovarian cancer we selected microRNAs
	that were over-expressed in ovarian tissues (both tumor and normal) comparing to other normal tissues, and in liver and pancreatic
	cancer we chose microRNAs that are over expressed in the cancerous tissue comparing to adjacent healthy tissue. Those microRNAs
	served to help us design modified oligonucleotides with anti-sense sequences that were used in vitro in proliferation assays.
	We specifically wanted to see microRNA inhibition that can lead to reduction in proliferation of cancer cell lines. The anti-microRNAs
	with the strongest effect over cell proliferation were selected as the drug candidates with most potential.

	Rimonim
	Consortium
</I>
	- In January 2011, we joined the Rimonim Consortium, which is supported
	by the Office of the Chief Scientist at the Ministry of Economy of the State of Israel,
	or the OCS. The aim of the consortium is to develop novel technologies for the use of
	short interfering RNA, or siRNA, and microRNA mimetics or anti-microRNAs for therapeutics.
	As a member of the consortium, we are entitled to certain grants to support our research
	and development activities. Under the terms applicable to members of the consortium,
	so long as we continue to meet the criteria for receiving these grants, which criteria
	include the payment by us of part of the expenses for the activities funded by the grants
	and the timely delivery to OCS of written reports regarding those activities, then we
	are not required to repay the grants. If we cease to meet these and other criteria, then
	the grant amounts for the year in which we ceased to meet the criteria become immediately
	due and payable to OCS. As of December 31, 2015, we had received total grants of $827,227
	from the OCS for our development within the consortium and continued to meet the criteria
	to receive grants such that we are not obligated to repay those funds. The vision of
	the consortium is to develop new advanced technologies that are expected to help in solving
	some of the key problems and deficiencies that the industry is facing in developing RNAi-based
	therapeutics and create a significant RNAi-based industry in Israel by using breakthrough
	technologies and producing RNAi therapeutics and a range of additional products (diagnostics,
	chemical and biological services). Since discovery, the development of RNAi as first,
	a powerful research tool and, more recently, as a promising therapeutic approach, has
	occurred very rapidly. The ability to specifically silence virtually every gene including
	previously non-druggable (non-amenable for development of small molecule inhibitors)
	targets has made RNAi-based therapeutics a very attractive approach for treating diseases
	in many therapeutic areas.

	As of March 1, 2016, our patent portfolio

	The term of foreign patents varies in
	accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition,
	in some instances, a patent term in the United States and outside of the United States can be extended to recapture a portion
	of the term effectively lost as a result of the health authority regulatory review period. These extensions, which may be as long
	as five years, are directed to the approved product and its approved indications. We intend to seek such extensions as appropriate.
	Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that
	a patent may remain in force for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage of the patent to our
	business and products.

	The patent positions of companies like
	ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary
	position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted.
	We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents or if issued will assist our
	business. Any patents that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. This could limit our ability
	to stop competitors from marketing related products and reduce the length of term of patent protection that we may have for any
	products. In addition, the rights granted under any patents which may issue may not provide us with proprietary protection or
	competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Our competitors may develop similar technologies, duplicate

	partners, collaborators, employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors and into invention assignment agreements
	with our employees and some of our commercial partners and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary
	information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of the technologies that are developed.

	In August 2006, we signed a royalty-bearing,

	Under the restated agreement, we have licensed from Johns Hopkins the rights to its proprietary microRNAs for all fields and applications
	on a non-exclusive basis. The agreement covers approximately 130 biologically validated microRNAs. We also have the right to further
	sublicense these rights, provided that such sublicense includes a license to substantial intellectual property rights owned or

	erroneous results. The categories were devised on the basis of the complexity of the test and include waived tests, tests of moderate

	A clinical laboratory may be licensed by the state in which it is located, but not all states require licensure. California and
	Pennsylvania require state licensure, and our laboratories located in those states each hold the appropriate state license. In
	addition, some states (California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island) require any clinical laboratory
	that analyzes samples taken from residents of or physicians located in that state to also be licensed by it. Many CLIA-certified
	laboratories also seek accreditation by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, and licensure by states that require that
	state specific licensure for a laboratory that intends to test clinical samples from residents of that state. The CAP Laboratory
	Accreditation Program is an internationally recognized program that utilizes teams of practicing laboratory professionals as inspectors,

	Although the FDA has consistently stated

	in not otherwise regulating most tests designed, manufactured and used within the high complexity CLIA-certified laboratory at
	which the test was performed. These tests are known as LDTs. After many years of promising that it would be providing guidance
	on the regulation of LDTs, the FDA provided notice to Congress on July 31, 2014, that it intended to issue a draft guidance document
	entitled, &ldquo;Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)&rdquo; and an accompanying draft guidance
	document entitled, &ldquo;FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs).&rdquo; The notice
	included the anticipated details of the draft guidance documents (&ldquo;Draft Guidance&rdquo;). In the Draft Guidance, the FDA
	describes its proposed regulatory framework as a phased-in risk-based approach to the regulation of LDTs in a manner that is consistent
	with the FDA&rsquo;s current regulation of in vitro diagnostics, or IVDs. This means that new LDTs or currently available LDTs
	could be subject to requirements for premarket review of higher-risk LDTs that have the same intended uses as IVDs that were (i)
	cleared for marketing by the FDA under section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or (ii) approved for marketing after
	submission, review and FDA approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.

	Devices that are already on the market would be allowed to remain on the market during FDA&rsquo;s review and consideration of

	diagnostic tests. The information

	how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of the
	controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to
	general controls, including labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to FDA&rsquo;s quality system regulation, which are
	device-specific good manufacturing practices. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including
	performance standards and post-market surveillance. Class III devices are subject to most of the previously identified requirements
	as well as to pre-market approval. Nearly all Class I devices are exempt from premarket review; most Class II devices require
	510(k) clearance and all Class III devices must receive premarket approval before they can be sold in the United States. The payment
	of a fee is usually required when a 510(k) notice or premarket approval application is submitted.

	A 510(k) notification requires the sponsor to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to another marketed
	device, termed a &ldquo;predicate device&rdquo;, that is legally marketed in the United States and for which a PMA was not required.
	A device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device if it has the same intended use and technological characteristics as
	the predicate; or has the same intended use but different technological characteristics, where the information submitted to the
	FDA does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and demonstrates that the device is at least as safe and effective

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0PT 0; TEXT-ALIGN: JUSTIFY">
	The FDA is supposed to issue a decision
	letter within 90 days of receipt of the 510(k) if it has no additional questions or send a first action letter requesting additional
	information within 75 days. However, in 2012, the FDA issued a guidance document in which it indicated that it will conduct a
	preliminary review of a 510(k) based on an acceptance checklist within 15 business days of the submission of the 510(k). If the
	FDA determines that the 510(k) is not administratively complete, it will refuse to accept the application until a complete response
	is submitted in response to the refuse to accept, or RTA, notification. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance,
	but a minority will. Requests for additional data, including clinical data, will increase the time necessary to review the notice.
	If the FDA believes that the device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will issue a &ldquo;Not Substantially
	Equivalent&rdquo; letter and designate the device as a Class III device, which will require the submission and approval of a PMA
	before the new device may be marketed. Under certain circumstances, the sponsor may petition the FDA to make a risk-based determination
	of the new device and reclassify the new device as a Class I or Class II device. The FDA continues to reevaluate the 510(k) review
	process, and we cannot predict what if any changes will occur.

	is more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by more detailed and comprehensive

	After the PMA is submitted, the FDA has

	date of filing, although in practice this review time is longer. Questions from the FDA, requests for additional data and referrals
	to advisory committees may delay the process considerably. The total process may take several years and there is no guarantee
	that the PMA will ever be approved. Even if approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the device may be marketed.
	The FDA may also request additional clinical data as a condition of approval or after the PMA is approved. Any changes to the

	In the European Union, IVD medical devices
	have been regulated under EU-Directive 98/79/EC, or the IVD Directive, and corresponding national provisions. The IVD Directive
	requires that medical devices meet the essential requirements set out in an annex of the directive. These requirements include
	the safety and efficacy of the devices. According to the IVD Directive, the Member States presume compliance with these essential
	requirements in respect of devices which are in conformity with the relevant national standards transposing the harmonized standards
	of which the reference numbers have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. These harmonized standards
	include ISO 13485:2003, the quality standard for medical device manufacturers. IVDs are not subject to pre-market authorization
	by a regulatory authority but to a conformity assessment which is often performed by the manufacturer. Certain specified high-risk
	devices and devices for self-testing require that the conformity assessment be performed by an independent third party known as
	a &ldquo;notified body.&rdquo; Notified bodies are designated and monitored by the Member States and act under the control of
	the national authorities. Once certified, devices bear the CE marking which allows them to circulate freely in the EU/EFTA countries
	and Turkey.

	In 2012, the EU published a revision to
	the current Directive in the form of a proposed Regulation. Unlike a Directive, a Regulation minimizes the likelihood of divergent
	transposition by Member States by ensuring that the legal requirements are implemented in the same way and at the same time. The
	proposed Regulation will introduce a new risk-based classification system based on the Global Harmonization Task Force classification
	rules. Depending on the level of risk associated with an IVD, IVD manufacturers will be required to include a notified body in
	the conformity assessment process. In addition, clinical evidence will be required for some IVDs. The new regulatory process is
	expected to replace the current one and will be phased in over a 5-year period.

	IVD medical devices, other than devices
	for performance evaluation, must bear the CE marking of conformity when they are placed on the market. The CE mark is a declaration
	by the manufacturer that the product meets all the appropriate provisions of the relevant legislation implementing the relevant
	European Directive. As a general rule, the manufacturer must follow the procedure of the EC Declaration of conformity to obtain
	this CE marking.

	Each European country must adopt its own

	to the placing on the market or the putting into service within their territory of devices bearing the CE marking according to
	the conformity assessment procedures. In September 2012, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation which if
	adopted will change the way that most medical devices are regulated in the European Union, and may subject our products to additional
	requirements.

	The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
	Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established for the first time comprehensive United States protection for the privacy and security of health
	information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or &ldquo;Covered Entities&rdquo;: health plans, healthcare
	clearing houses, and healthcare providers which conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities must
	have in place administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to guard against the misuse of protected health information.
	Specifically, Title II of HIPAA, the administrative Simplification Act, contains four provisions that address the privacy of health
	data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization
	of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect identifiable health information
	or &ldquo;protected health information&rdquo; by limiting its use and release and giving patients the right to access and amend
	their protected health information. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical
	safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. Additionally, some state laws impose privacy protections
	more stringent than HIPAA and many impose security standards and breach notification requirements that apply in addition to HIPAA.
	Most of the institutions and physicians from which we obtain biological specimens that we use in our research and validation work
	are Covered Entities that must comply with HIPAA standards, such as obtaining proper authorization and consent from their patients
	for the subsequent use of those samples and associated clinical information. We are a Covered Entity to the extent that our U.S.
	operations involve standard transactions conducted electronically (such as billing) in connection with clinical testing. Accordingly,
	we have implemented privacy and security policies and procedures consistent with HIPAA standards and taken other steps to comply.

	In 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of
	the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
	Act of 2009. Final HITECH regulations were published in January, 2013. HITECH amends HIPAA and, among other things, creates significant
	new regulatory compliance obligations for &ldquo;business associates&rdquo; or organizations that provide services to Covered
	Entities involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and downstream entities providing services to business
	associates. Additionally, HITECH expands and strengthens HIPAA enforcement, imposes new penalties for noncompliance and establishes
	new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities and business associates. Under HITECH&rsquo;s new breach notification
	requirements, Covered Entities must, as soon as possible but not later than 60 days following discovery, notify each individual
	whose information has been or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired or disclosed as a result of a breach. Covered
	Entities must also report breaches to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and in some cases, publish information
	about the breach in local or prominent media outlets. Consequently, it is important that breaches of PHI are promptly detected
	and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications. Most states have adopted data security laws protecting
	the personal data of state residents. Personal data subject to protection typically includes an individual&rsquo;s name coupled
	with social security number, state-issued identification number, or financial account number. Most states require specific, technical
	security measures for the protection of all personal data, including employee data, and impose their own breach notification requirements
	in the event of a loss of personal data. Many states have also adopted genetic testing and privacy laws. These laws typically
	require a specific, written consent for genetic testing as well as consent for the disclosure of genetic test results, and otherwise
	limit uses and disclosures of genetic testing results. A few states have adopted laws that give their residents property rights
	in their genetic information. State privacy and data security laws generally overlap and apply simultaneously with HIPAA. In the
	event of a data breach affecting individuals from more than one state, we must comply with all relevant state notification requirements
	as well as HIPAA and are subject to enforcement by all relevant state and federal authorities as well as fines and penalties imposed
	by each state.

	We are currently subject to the HIPAA
	regulations and maintain an active program designed to address regulatory compliance issues. Regulations and guidance in this
	area are evolving so we must regularly evaluate and update our regulatory compliance measures to remain in compliance with the
	law. We are subject to audit by federal authorities and subject to prosecution or administrative enforcement and increased civil
	and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including monetary penalties. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys
	general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH and who also enforce state data security laws.

	Our activities must also comply with other
	applicable privacy laws. For example, there are international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure
	of health and other personal information. Non-U.S. privacy protection requirements, such as the European Union&rsquo;s Data Protection
	Directive governing the processing of personal data, may be stricter than U.S. law and violations could result in claims for damages,
	fines, or orders to stop or change the processing of the personal data. The European Union&rsquo;s final draft General Data Protection
	Regulation, which is likely to be formally adopted, imposes extensive new legal obligations and substantially increases the risk
	of fines, with upper limits based on a corporate group&rsquo;s global turnover. Privacy and data security laws, including those
	relating to health information, are complex, overlapping and rapidly evolving. All of these laws may impact our business. Our
	failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain tissue samples
	and associated patient information or to conduct clinical testing could significantly impact our business and our future business
	plans.

	The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and
	prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the
	Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, the Office of Inspector
	General for the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has issued regulations, commonly known as &ldquo;safe harbors.&rdquo;
	These safe harbors set forth certain requirements that, if fully met, will assure healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories,
	that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these safe harbor provisions ensures
	against prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, full compliance is often difficult and the failure of a transaction or arrangement
	to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution
	under the Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable
	safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG.

	and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain &ldquo;designated health services&rdquo; for which payment would otherwise
	be made by Medicare if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity.
	The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing Medicare for any good or service furnished pursuant
	to an unlawful referral, and any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral is obligated to refund
	such amounts. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law&rsquo;s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000
	for each such arrangement or scheme. The penalties for violating the Stark Law also include civil monetary penalties of up to
	$15,000 per service and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, through application of other laws, conduct
	that violates the Stark Law can also give rise to False Claims Act lawsuits.

	Many states have their own self-referral

	The AMA has specific procedures for establishing

	Coverage Decisions
</I>
	. When deciding
	whether to cover a particular diagnostic test, private and government third-party payors generally consider whether the test is
	a covered benefit and, if so, whether it is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness and injury. Most
	third-party payors do not cover experimental services. Coverage determinations often are influenced by current standards of practice
	and clinical data, particularly at the local level. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, which is the government
	agency responsible for overseeing the Medicare program, has the authority to make coverage determinations on a national basis,
	but most Medicare coverage decisions are made at the local level by contractors that administer the Medicare program in specified
	geographic areas. Private and government third-party payors have separate processes for making coverage determinations, and private
	third-party payors may or may not follow Medicare&rsquo;s coverage decisions. If a third-party payor has a coverage determination
	in place for a particular diagnostic test, billing for that test must comply with the established policy. Otherwise, the third-party
	payor makes reimbursement decisions on a case-by-case basis.

</I>
	Payment for covered diagnostic
	tests is determined based on various methodologies, including prospective payment systems and fee schedules. Private third-party
	payors may negotiate contractual rates with participating providers, set rates as a percentage of the billed charge, or pay a
	set amount based on a fee schedule. &nbsp;Payment for diagnostic tests furnished to Medicare Part B beneficiaries is made based
	on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, under which a payment amount is assigned to each covered CPT code. Payment for
	a clinical laboratory test is based on the lesser of the actual charge, the local fee, or the National Limitation Amount (NLA).&nbsp;
	The law technically requires local fee schedule amounts to be adjusted annually by the percentage increase in the consumer price
	index, or CPI, for the prior year, but Congress has frozen payment rates in certain years. For calendar year 2016, the NLA is
	74% of the median of all local contractor fee schedule amounts for tests for which NLAs were established before January 1, 2001,
	and 100% for tests for which NLAs were first established on or after January 1, 2001. Medicaid programs generally pay for diagnostic
	tests based on a fee schedule, but reimbursement varies by state.

	The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which was signed into
	law on April 1, 2014, significantly altered the current payment methodology for clinical diagnostic laboratory services
	covered by the Medicare Part B program and paid according to the CLFS. Under PAMA, applicable laboratories must report rates
	paid by private payors (i.e., health insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicaid managed
	care organizations) for each clinical diagnostic laboratory test (CDLT) that it furnished during the data collection
	period.&nbsp; The reported data must include payment rates (reflecting all discounts, rebates, coupons and other price
	concessions), Healthcare Common Procedure
	Coding System codes, and the volume of tests associated with each rate.&nbsp;The CLFS payment rate for each CDLT (with
	some exceptions) will be equal to the weighted median, as calculated based on the data submitted by applicable
	laboratories.&nbsp; Every three years new data will be submitted, and new rates for CDLTs will be established based on that
	data.&nbsp; Significant reductions in reimbursement would be phased in over time.&nbsp; CMS would limit the maximum
	reimbursement reduction for a particular CDLT to no more than 10% each year in 2017 through 2019 and no more than 15% each
	year in 2020 through 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp; PAMA required publication of a final rule by June 15, 2015, submission of initial
	payment data on January 1, 2016, and implementation of new CLFS payment rates as of January 1, 2017.&nbsp;CMS did not publish
	a proposed rule until October 1, 2015, and has yet to issue a final rule. Whether CMS will implement new payment rates as of
	January 1, 2017, as required by PAMA, is therefore unknown at this time.

	Although CMS has not yet

	laboratory tests,&rdquo; or ADLTs, rather than CDLTs. For existing ADLTs, new data will be submitted and new rates will be
	established based on that data annually. The initial payment rate (for a period not to exceed nine months) for a new ADLT
	will be set at the &ldquo;actual list charge&rdquo; for the test as reported by the laboratory. Insofar as the actual list
	charge substantially exceeds private payer rates (by more than 30%), CMS will have the ability to recoup excess payments made
	during the initial nine-month payment period.

	during hospital outpatient visits under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System. While CMS exempted molecular diagnostic
	tests from this packaging provision, it is possible that CMS could propose to bundle payment for such tests in the future. Our
	tests are generally not paid in the hospital outpatient setting, and insofar as they are paid in that setting they likely would
	be considered molecular tests if billed under specific procedure codes, but it is possible that payment for our tests could be

	of our office holders required the approval of our audit committee and our Board of Directors, in that order. In addition, all
	compensation awarded to directors, also required the approval of our shareholders by a simple majority. Following Amendment 20,
	we were required to form a Compensation Committee, whose members need to comply with certain criteria, as well as to adopt a compensation
	policy regarding the compensation terms of our Office Holders, which includes direct and indirect compensation, including equity-based
	awards, exemption from liability, indemnification and insurance, severance and other benefits (&ldquo;Compensation Terms&rdquo;).

	We are incorporated in Israel, and, therefore,
	subject to various corporate governance practices under Israeli law relating to such matters as external directors, independent
	directors, the audit committee, the compensation committee, independent auditor and the internal auditor. These matters are in
	addition to the requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market and other relevant provisions of U.S. securities laws. Under The NASDAQ
	Capital Market rules, a foreign private issuer may generally follow its home country rules of corporate governance in lieu of
	the comparable NASDAQ Capital Market requirements, except for certain matters such as composition and responsibilities of the
	audit committee and the independence of its members. For U.S. domestic companies, NASDAQ Capital Market rules specify that the
	board of directors must contain a majority of independent directors within 12 months of its initial public offering. We currently
	comply with this requirement as well as the committee composition and responsibility requirements with respect to our committees.
	In addition, under the Companies Law, we are required to appoint at least two external directors. Gerald Dogon and Tali Yaron-Eldar
	were appointed as our external directors, each of whom is also independent under the rules of The NASDAQ Capital Market. Mr. Dogon
	and Ms. Yaron-Eldar were re-elected as external directors by a general meeting on August 5, 2013 for three-year terms that expire

	Under the Companies Law, the board of directors
	must appoint an internal auditor recommended by the audit committee. On May, 7, 2007, we appointed Yardeni Gelfend as our internal
	auditor. The role of the internal auditor is to examine, among other things, whether a company&rsquo;s actions comply with applicable
	law and orderly business procedure. Under the Companies Law, the internal auditor may not be an interested party or an office
	holder, or a relative of an interested party or an office holder, nor may the internal auditor be the company&rsquo;s independent
	auditor or anyone on his behalf. An interested party is defined in the Companies Law as a holder of 5% or more of the Company&rsquo;s
	outstanding shares or voting rights, any person or entity who has the right to designate one director or more or the chief executive
	officer of the company or any person who serves as a director or as a chief executive officer. The internal auditor&rsquo;s tenure
	cannot be terminated without his or her consent, nor can he or she be suspended from such position unless the board of directors
	has so resolved after hearing the opinion of the audit committee and after giving the internal auditor the opportunity to present
	his or her case to the board and to the audit committee.

	Upon shareholder approval of the 2006 Global Share Incentive Plan, or 2006 Plan, in July 2006, the 2003 Plan was terminated and

	The Companies Law requires that an office

	known to him or her, in connection with any existing or proposed transaction by the company. The disclosure is required to be
	made promptly and in any event, no later than the board of directors meeting in which the transaction is first discussed. &ldquo;Personal
	interest&rdquo;, is defined by the Companies Law, as a personal interest of a person in an act or transaction of the company,
	including a personal interest of his or her relative or of a corporate body in which that person or his relative holds 5% or more
	of the outstanding shares or voting rights, is a director or general manager, or in which either of them has the right to appoint
	at least one director or the general manager. &ldquo;Personal interest&rdquo; does not apply to a personal interest stemming merely
	from the fact that the office holder is also a shareholder in the company. The term &ldquo;personal interest&rdquo; also includes
	the personal interest of a person voting under a proxy given by another person, even if such appointing person has no personal
	interest in the proposed act or transaction. In addition, the vote of a person voting under a proxy given by a person having a
	personal interest in the proposed act or transaction, even if the person voting under the proxy has no personal interest, shall
	be deemed as a vote made by a person having a personal interest in the proposed act or transaction. The Companies Law defines
	a &ldquo;relative&rdquo; as a person&rsquo;s spouse, sibling, parent, grandparent or descendent, as well as the descendant, sibling
	or parent of a person&rsquo;s spouse, or the spouse of any of the foregoing.

	Under the Companies Law, certain transactions
	require special approvals, provided however that such transactions are for the benefit of the company. A transaction, between
	the company and an office holder, or between the company and a third party in which the office holder has a personal interest,
	must be approved by the board, subject to the provisions of the company&rsquo;s articles of association. If the transaction is
	an extraordinary transaction, then it also must be approved by the audit committee, prior to the approval of the board of directors.
	Any engagement between a company and any one of its office holders with respect to terms of office and/or employment by the company,
	including with respect to the grant of exemption from liability, indemnification or insurance would generally require compensation
	committee and board of directors&rsquo; approval, and in some cases followed by approval of the general assembly, all as noted
	below under &ldquo;Directors&rsquo; and Officers&rsquo; Compensation.&rdquo; Generally, any person having a personal interest
	in the approval of a transaction which is considered at a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee, may not be
	present at such meeting or participate in the vote on such transaction, provided however that an office holder having a personal
	interest in a transaction may be present in order to present such transaction, if the chairman of the audit committee or of the
	board of directors, as applicable, determine that the presence of such office holder is required for the presentation of the transaction.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, a director may be present at such meeting and may participate in the vote on such transaction,
	if the majority of the board of directors or the audit committee, as applicable, has a personal interest in the transaction. If
	a majority of the directors have a personal interest in a transaction, shareholder approval is also required.

	from income eligible for benefits under the Investment Law will generally be subject to a reduced 15% dividend withholding tax

	general, the current and preceding tax year of the Israeli company. The lower 12.5% rate applies only on dividends distributed

	Subject to certain conditions and limitations,

	income tax liability. For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends paid on our ordinary shares will be treated
	as income from sources outside the United States and will generally constitute passive category income. Further, in certain circumstances,
	if a U.S. holder has held ordinary shares for less than a specified minimum period during which the U.S. holder is not protected
	from risk of loss, or is obligated to make payments related to the dividends, such U.S. holder will not be allowed a foreign tax
	credit for foreign taxes imposed on dividends paid on our ordinary shares. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex.
	U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular
	circumstances. Instead of claiming a credit, a U.S. holder may, at its election, deduct such otherwise creditable Israeli withholding
	taxes in computing its taxable income, but only for a taxable year in which such holder elect to do so with respect to all foreign

	of an ordinary share as capital gain or loss, long-term if the U.S. holder has held the share for more than one year. In general,
	a U.S. holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the fair market value of any
	property and the amount of cash received in such disposition and the U.S. holder&rsquo;s adjusted tax basis in such share. A U.S.
	holder&rsquo;s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the U.S. holder&rsquo;s acquisition cost less any return of capital. Subject

	long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. holder generally will be eligible for reduced rates of tax. The deduction

	purchases, or enters into a contract or option to purchase, substantially identical stock or securities within 30 days before or
	after any disposition. Gain or loss from the disposition of our ordinary shares will generally be from U.S. sources, but such gain
	or loss may be from a non-U.S. source under some circumstances under the Treaty. If such gain or loss is treated as U.S. source
	gain or loss, a U.S. holder may not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any Israeli tax imposed on the disposition
	of an ordinary share unless such credit can be applied (subject to applicable limitations) against tax due on other income treated

	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
	are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and
	its subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,

	presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	Rosetta Genomics Ltd. (the &quot;Company&quot;)
	commenced its operations on March 9, 2000. The Company's integrative research platform
	combining bioinformatics and state-of-the-art laboratory processes has led to the discovery
	of hundreds of biologically validated novel human microRNAs. Building on its strong patent
	position and proprietary platform technologies, Rosetta Genomics is working on the application
	of these technologies in the development of a full range of microRNA-based diagnostic
	tools. The Company's microRNA-based tests, RosettaGX Cancer Origin&trade;, RosettaGX
	Reveal&trade;, mi-LUNG&trade;, and mi-KIDNEY&trade;, are commercially available worldwide
	and all samples are processed in its Philadelphia-based CAP-accredited, Clinical Laboratories
	Improvement Amendments (&quot;CLIA&quot;) certified lab. With the acquisition of CynoGen,
	Inc. (described in Note 1c below), the Company now offers a broader menu of molecular
	and other assays for bladder, lung, prostate and breast cancer patients through its new
	facility in Lake Forest, California.

	Under the terms of the 2015 Private

	(subject to adjustment), exercisable for a period of five years from the Closing Date

	the price of the units, and became exercisable for an aggregate of 2,666,667 shares based
	on 85% of the arithmetic average of the five lowest weighted average prices calculated

	As of December 31, 2015, the Company's

	and capital expenditures. The Company&rsquo;s ability to successfully carry out its business
	plan is primarily dependent upon its ability to (1) obtain sufficient additional capital,

	indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on
	audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the
	largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, no liability
	for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded, as a result of the implementation of ASC 740.

	In
	May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede
	most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will
	recognize revenue upon the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in
	exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue
	is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of the time value of money
	in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved
	in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty
	of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity&rsquo;s contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the interim and
	annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 (early adoption is permitted for the interim and annual periods beginning
	on or after December 15, 2016). The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

	In September 2015, the
	FASB issued guidance on current accounting for measurement-period adjustments. The new guidance requires entities to recognize
	adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment
	amounts are determined. Measurement period adjustments were previously required to be retrospectively adjusted as of the acquisition
	date. The provisions of this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
	December 15, 2015 (early adoption is permitted), and should be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the
	impact of the guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

	In November
	2015, the FASB issued guidance on balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The new guidance requires entities to present
	all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, as non-current on the balance sheet. The
	guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (early adoption is permitted).The Company
	believes this guidance will not have significant effect on its consolidated financial statements.

	In
	February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, &ldquo;Leases (ASC 842)&rdquo;, which sets out the principles for the recognition,
	measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard
	requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of
	whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine
</FONT>
	whether lease
	expense is recognized
<FONT STYLE="COLOR: #2F2F2F">
	based on an effective interest method
</FONT>
	or
<FONT STYLE="COLOR: #2F2F2F">
	on
	a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a
	lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of
	12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors
	to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing
	leases and operating leases. The ASU is expected to impact the Company's
</FONT>
	consolidated financial statements as the Company
	has certain operating lease arrangements. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840 Leases. The standard is effective
	on January&nbsp;1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

	the remaining contractual life of the warrant, a risk-free rate of interest, and an estimate of the Company&rsquo;s share volatility.
	The fair value of the liability for warrants related to share purchase agreements classified within Level 3. The fair value of

	The Directors, except for External Directors, shall be classified, with respect to the time for which they severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, as determined by the Board of Directors, one class to hold office initially for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2008, another class to hold office initially for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2009, and another class to hold office initially for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2010, with the members of each class to hold office until their successors are elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of the shareholders, the successors of the class of Directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders held in the third year following the year of their election. If the number of Directors constituting the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly as possible, and any additional directors of any class shall hold office for a term which shall coincide with the remaining term of such class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Notwithstanding anything in these Articles to the contrary, the provisions of this Article 39(a) may not be amended without approval of the greater of (i) holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power represented at a meeting in person or by proxy and voting thereon, or (ii) holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of all shares of the Company voting on such matter at a General Meeting.&quot;

	. Within two weeks of the execution of this Amendment, Rosetta
	will cause a standby letter of credit to be issued for the beneficiary of Lessor in the amount of $625,365.76 (the &ldquo;
<U>
	Letter
	of Credit
</U>
	&rdquo;) in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lessor. The Letter of Credit shall be reasonably reduced from
	time to time by the amount of Base Rent plus Common Area Maintenance charges under the Lease paid by Lessee to Lessor from and
	after the date that the Letter of Credit is initially issued, but in no event shall the Letter of Credit be reduced to less than
	$77,525.04. The Letter of Credit shall be issued by a bank reasonably acceptable to Lessor whose deposits are insured by the FDIC.
	The Letter of Credit shall be unconditional, irrevocable, transferable, and payable to Lessor or Lessor&rsquo;s agent solely upon
	presentment by Lessor or Lessor&rsquo;s agent of a sight draft in person, by courier, overnight mail, or by facsimile transmission
	in partial or full draws. Lessor may draw on the Letter or Credit in whole or in part and use, apply, or retain the whole or any

	other sum payable by Lessee under the Lease if Lessee defaults in observing or performing any of the terms, provisions or conditions
	of the Lease on Lessee&rsquo;s part to be observed or performed, after the expiration of applicable notice and cure periods under
	the Lease. If the Letter of Credit is lost, stolen, or mutilated, Lessee shall cooperate with Lessor, promptly upon Lessor&rsquo;s
	request, to replace such Letter of Credit. If Lessee shall fully and faithfully comply with all of the terms, provisions, covenants
	and conditions of the Lease, and delivers possession of the Premises to Lessor at the Expiration Date in the conditions required
	by the Lease, the Letter of Credit shall be returned to Lessee within 30 days after the Expiration Date. Lessor&rsquo;s use of
	the Letter of Credit proceeds shall not be deemed a waiver of Lessee&rsquo;s default or a waiver of any other rights and remedies
	to which Lessor may be entitled under the provisions of the Lease by reason of such default, it being intended that Lessor&rsquo;s
	rights to use the whole or any part of the Letter of Credit proceeds shall be in addition to, but not in limitation of, any such

	Each Party&rsquo;s right of termination under

</U>
	, written notice thereof must be given by the terminating
	Party to the other Party specifying the provision of
<U>
	Section&nbsp;7.1
</U>
	pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
	Agreement will terminate and become void and of no further force and effect and there will be no further liability or obligation
	on the part of any Party hereto, except that the provisions of
<U>
	Section&nbsp;7.1

	, this
<U>
	Section&nbsp;7.2
</U>

	or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
	provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term

	Legal Representation
</U>
	. Buyer agrees that, as to all communications between all counsel for Seller, the Company, MDI
	and each of their Affiliates (including without limitation, Reed Smith LLP), and Seller and/or any of its respective Affiliates
	(including, prior to the Closing, the Company) that relate in any way to this Agreement or any agreement or matter contemplated
	hereby (collectively, the &ldquo;
<U>
	Privileged Communications
</U>
	&rdquo;), the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of
	client confidence with respect to the Privileged Communications belongs to Seller and may be controlled by Seller and will not
	pass to or be claimed by Buyer, MDI or the Company (after the Closing) or any of their respective Affiliates. The Privileged Communications
	are the property of Seller, and from and after the Closing none of MDI, the Company, its Affiliates or any Person purporting to
	act on behalf of or through MDI, the Company or its Affiliates will seek to obtain such communications, whether by seeking a waiver
	of the attorney-client privilege or through other means. Buyer, MDI, and the Company (after the Closing), and each of their respective
	Affiliates, successors or assigns further agree that no such Party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any
	action against or involving Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing. The Privileged Communications may be used by Seller
	and/or any of its Affiliates in connection with any dispute that relates to this Agreement or any agreement or matter contemplated
	hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
	Affiliates, on the one hand and a third party (other than a Party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates), on
	the other hand, after the Closing, MDI, the Company and its Affiliates may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
	of confidential communications by counsel to such third party, provided that none of MDI, the Company or its Affiliates may waive
	such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller.
