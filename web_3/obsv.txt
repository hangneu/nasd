	We are a clinical-stage
	biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman&#146;s reproductive health and pregnancy. Our goal is to build the leading women&#146;s reproductive
	health and pregnancy company focused on conditions where current treatment options are limited and significant unmet needs exist.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are
	focused on providing therapeutic solutions for women between the ages of 15 and 49 who suffer from reproductive health conditions that affect their quality of life, ability to conceive or that complicate pregnancy and the health of
	newborns.&nbsp;There are millions of women of reproductive age affected by conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids and preterm labor, or that require in vitro fertilization, or IVF, to conceive. Our most advanced product candidates are
	designed to address the symptoms associated with endometriosis and uterine fibroids and to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing IVF.&nbsp;Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue that normally lines
	the inside of the uterus, called the endometrium, grows outside of the uterus, causing monthly bleeding and chronic inflammatory reactions inside the abdomen, that may result in ovarian cyst formation, scar tissue and adhesions.&nbsp;Uterine
	fibroids, also known as leiomyomata or myoma, are common non-cancerous tumors that develop in the muscular wall of the uterus and have disabling symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding.&nbsp;We are also developing a product candidate to treat
	preterm labor.

	We were founded in November 2012 by former executives of PregLem SA, or PregLem, a
	Swiss-based specialty biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative drugs for women&#146;s reproductive health. While at PregLem, our senior management team collaborated in the clinical development and
	commercialization of several women&#146;s reproductive health therapeutics, including Esmya (ulipristal acetate) for the treatment of uterine fibroids. PregLem was subsequently acquired by Gedeon Richter in 2010.&nbsp;We believe we will be able to
	leverage our senior management team&#146;s long-standing experience working together and with key opinion leaders, patient groups, payors, reproductive health networks, fertility clinics, obstetricians and gynecologists, or OB/GYNs, nurses and
	pharmacists to identify, in-license or acquire, develop and commercialize product candidates.

	OBE2109 for the Treatment of Pain Associated with Endometriosis and Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Uterine Fibroids
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are developing OBE2109 as a novel, oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH, receptor antagonist, which is a type of drug that binds to
	the receptor and thus inhibits GnRH from eliciting a response from the same receptor, for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women.&nbsp;As of 2014, we
	believe that approximately 2.5 million women in the United States were diagnosed and being treated for endometriosis, and the majority of those women experience significant pain during menstrual periods. According to a study published in the
	American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology in 2003, uterine fibroids affect an estimated 20 to 40% of women over the age of 30 in the United States based on clinical cases and women who undergo treatment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2015, we in-licensed OBE2109 from Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Kissei, a Japanese pharmaceutical company.&nbsp;Prior to in-licensing
	OBE2109, Kissei completed a preclinical program, a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy female volunteers of Japanese and European descent and three Phase 2a clinical trials in patients of Japanese descent with endometriosis, including one trial that
	included a subgroup of patients with both endometriosis and uterine fibroids. In these trials, OBE2109 was observed to have a linear pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile, a predictable dose-dependent suppression of estradiol, which is a form of the
	hormone estrogen, and a dose range that was well-tolerated and provided symptom relief. A drug&#146;s PK profile refers to the specific way in which a given drug is handled by the body over time, including the particular patterns of the specified
	drug&#146;s absorption, distribution and elimination from the body, while a drug&#146;s pharmacodynamic, or PD, profile refers to the biochemical and physiological effects of a drug on the body. We expect OBE2109 to potentially reduce pain symptoms
	associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, while mitigating bone mineral density loss and other adverse effects associated with excessive estradiol suppression.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are currently conducting a multiple-dose, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109 in patients with endometriosis across 46
	sites in the United States and 15 sites in Central and Eastern Europe, with a target enrollment of 330 patients, which we refer to as the EDELWEISS clinical trial.&nbsp;We expect to report the primary efficacy results from the 24-week evaluation
	period of the EDELWEISS clinical trial in the first half of 2018. For the uterine fibroids indication, we intend to commence a Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program with two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials, which we refer to as the PRIMROSE clinical trials, in
	the first half of 2017. We expect to report data from these Phase 3 PRIMROSE clinical trials in the first half of 2020.

	daily dosing across indications, while one of the competitive product candidates is being developed for twice daily dosing.

	one or two dosing options, which do not appear to account for individual patient characteristics, individual response or patient preference.

	. For symptoms associated with both endometriosis and uterine fibroids, we are developing OBE2109 as a stand-alone treatment (without need for add-back therapy) and
	in association with add-back therapy (fixed-dose combination therapy) to fulfill the needs of a broad patient population with endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Add-back therapy refers to the administration of additional estrogen during treatment to
	counteract the side effects of excessive suppression of estradiol. We believe at least one other product in clinical development is only being evaluated as a fixed-dose combination therapy that includes add-back therapy, which we believe may not be
	suitable for treatment of women with poor tolerance or contraindications to add-back therapy. We also believe that at least one of the other products in clinical development has demonstrated, at the dose being developed in the clinical trials, a
	bone mineral density loss at 24 weeks of treatment comparable to Lupron, a GnRH agonist used for the treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids.

	We are developing OBE001 (nolasiban), an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist, to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in
	women undergoing IVF.&nbsp;In Europe, approximately 620,000 IVF treatments were performed in 2012, and in the United States, approximately 210,000 IVF treatments were performed in 2014. The IVF process has an overall live birth rate of approximately
	33% in the United States and 21% in Europe.

	transfer.&nbsp;In our post-hoc analysis, which excluded patients with progesterone levels in the top quartile of the patient pool, we identified a statistically significant dose-proportional increase in pregnancy rate at 10 weeks as well as live
	birth rates. We believe that high progesterone levels can lead to a premature closing of the embryo implantation window.&nbsp;Based on these results, we intend to

	Preterm labor, defined as the body commencing the birthing process prior to 37 weeks, is characterized by uterine contractions, cervical
	dilation and rupture of the fetal membranes that surround and protect the fetus during pregnancy. Preterm labor can lead to preterm birth, which is currently the leading worldwide cause of death of newborn babies. According to the National Center

	concerns for the fetus. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability and PK profile of OBE022 in healthy post-menopausal female volunteers after single doses of 10 mg to 1,300 mg and multiple doses between
	100 mg per day and 1,000&nbsp;mg per day over 7 consecutive days. Based on preliminary data, OBE022 was observed to have a favorable safety profile and to be well-tolerated at doses up to 1,300 mg after single dose administration and up to
	1,000&nbsp;mg per day after multiple dose administration over 7 days, each of which are above the estimated clinical effective dose.

	offering price of $15.00 per common share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to advance the development of OBE2109, OBE001 and OBE022 and for
	general corporate purposes. Further, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to pursue our strategy to in-license or acquire additional product candidates, although we have no agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses

	The risk of failure for our product candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product
	candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and
	clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective in humans. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial
	process. For example, in our Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE001 in women undergoing IVF, OBE001 did not achieve the primary endpoint of a statistically significant increase in pregnancy rate after six weeks and, as a result, we are required to conduct
	additional clinical trials and analyses which may ultimately delay the development of OBE001. Additionally, we are planning to conduct a PK and PD study to confirm the add-back dosage to be utilized in our Phase 3 PRIMROSE clinical trials for
	OBE2109&#146;s uterine fibroid indication. If the results of the PK and PD study do not support our dosing assumptions, we may need to adapt our

	In addition, the results of preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical
	trials. The results generated to date in preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates do not ensure that later preclinical studies or clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. Further, we have limited clinical data for
	each of our product candidates and have not completed Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials for any of our product candidates. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having
	progressed through preclinical and earlier stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles,
	notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have
	believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.

	In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product
	candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in clinical trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols, and the rate
	of dropout among clinical trial participants. Specifically, the three Phase 2 clinical trials of OBE2109 only enrolled women of Japanese descent, and therefore the effects of OBE2109 on women of European descent in our Phase 2b clinical trial of
	OBE2109 in women with pain associated with endometriosis or our two planned Phase 3 clinical trials of OBE2109, which will be conducted in Europe and in the United States, in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids may

	We intend to seek formal advice and guidance from the FDA prior to advancing our product
	candidates into further studies and pivotal clinical trials. If the feedback we receive is different from what we currently anticipate, this could delay the development and regulatory approval process for these product candidates. For example, we do
	not believe our subjective 11-point numeric pain rating scale we are using in our Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109 in women with pain associated with endometriosis will be sufficient, on its own, to support a suitable endpoint for future Phase 3
	clinical trials. As a result, we believe we will be required to validate an additional assessment of pain for our Phase 3 program.&nbsp;We will have limited experience using this new pain assessment rating scale in a clinical setting, which, as a
	result, increases the risk that we may have unforeseen, or variability in, results from this clinical trial.

	We generally plan to seek

	such other countries regarding safety, efficacy, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates. Even if we are successful in obtaining approval in one jurisdiction, we
	cannot ensure that we will obtain approval in any other jurisdiction. Failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere.&nbsp;Failure to obtain marketing authorization for our product
	candidates will result in our being unable to market and sell such products. If we fail to obtain approval in any jurisdiction, the geographic market for our product candidates could be limited. Similarly, regulatory agencies may not approve the
	labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates or may grant approvals for more limited patient populations than requested.

	Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of an NDA or foreign marketing application for our product candidates,
	the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials or the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS,
	which may be required to ensure safe use of the drug after approval. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of that product candidate and would adversely impact our

	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product

	Clinical trials, such as our initial Phase 2 clinical trial for OBE001, often fail to demonstrate efficacy or safety of the product candidate studied for the target indication.

	Moreover, undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt
	clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.&nbsp;Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and
	prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. Accordingly, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or sub-populations in which such side effects are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable
	from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in preclinical or early-stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that restricted their use and prevented further development of the compound for larger

	There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly
	approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered.
	The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. Some third-party payors may require pre-approval of
	coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use such therapies. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and

	Obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly. No uniform policy
	for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is
	often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently
	or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases at short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely.

	Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market
	regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of
	medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price
	controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the
	United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.

	Moreover, increasing efforts by
	governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover
	or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance
	organizations, and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers

	periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, clinical trial sites and other contractors. Although we rely on CROs to conduct any current or planned GLP-compliant preclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical trials and have
	limited influence over their actual performance, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations,
	and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fail to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed

	of our intellectual property by CROs, which may reduce our trade secret protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or
	obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reason, our clinical
	trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize any product candidate that we develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any

	If our

	that Kissei is using to supply the API for OBE2109 received a warning letter from the FDA in November 2016 citing deviations from cGMP requirements with respect to its drug manufacturing facility. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully
	manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control
	over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product
	candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if
	approved. Any failure to achieve and maintain compliance with these laws, regulations and standards could subject us to the risk that we may have to suspend the manufacturing of our product candidates or that obtained approvals could be revoked,
	which would adversely affect our business and reputation. Furthermore, third-party providers may breach agreements they have with us because of factors beyond our control. They may also terminate or refuse to renew their agreements because of their
	own financial difficulties or business priorities, potentially at a time that is costly or otherwise inconvenient for us. If we were unable to find adequate replacement or another acceptable solution in time, our clinical trials could be delayed or

	There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA,
	and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate passed legislation, which if signed into law by President-elect Trump, would repeal certain
	aspects of the ACA. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. At this time, the full effect that the ACA would have on our business remains unclear.

	In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011,
	the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years
	2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year.
	These reductions went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025

	unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare
	payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new
	laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have an adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop
	new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, set a goal of moving 30% of Medicare payments to alternative payment models tied to the quality or value of services by 2016
	and 50% of Medicare payments into these alternative payment models by the end of 2018. In March, HHS announced that it has achieved its goal for 2016. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which
	manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare
	products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.

	Individual states
	in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts,
	restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by
	third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine
	what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect
	our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

	In the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory
	developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize any of our product candidates, if approved. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or member state
	level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and
	reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than European Union, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the
	pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service
	providers. Coupled with ever-increasing European Union and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval
	activities and affect our ability to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price
	ceilings on specific products and therapies.

	We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to
	our development programs and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our current and future product candidates. We have
	sought to protect our proprietary position by filing and in-licensing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our development programs and product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and

	It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain

	prosecute and maintain the patent rights for OBE022 and rely on our licensors Kissei and Merck Serono to prosecute and maintain the patent rights for OBE2109 and OBE001. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in
	a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our current and future product candidates in the United States or in other
	foreign countries. Our patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless, and until, a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover

	behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions remain confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the

	United States&nbsp;remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States&nbsp;and elsewhere are published approximately 18&nbsp;months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing

	and the patent&#146;s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our product candidates. We may incorrectly determine

	Patents have a limited

	the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering OBE2109, OBE001 and OBE022 are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, including biosimilar or
	generic medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are
	commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to ours.

	Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be
	eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a
	patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail
	to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent
	term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a
	result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced.&nbsp;Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product
	earlier than might otherwise be the case.

	As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents.
	Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological complexity and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In

	An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a &#147;first-to-file&#148; system
	for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO,
	after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to
	filing of a patent application, but circumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions.

	of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S.
	patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially
	provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt
	to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and
	costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.

	, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain

	value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to
	enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent laws has also increased in recent years. For example, the April 2010 amendment of the European Patent
	Convention, which limited the time permitted for filing divisional applications, was subsequently abrogated. This amendment and subsequent abrogation illustrates the uncertainty involved in the prosecution of European patent laws.&nbsp;In addition,

	our patents are invalid or unenforceable or claims challenging the scope of the intellectual property rights we own or control. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are
	commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability
	assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar
	validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte re-examinations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the
	context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our licensors and the patent examiner were unaware during
	prosecution. For the patents and patent applications that we have licensed, we may have limited or no right to participate in the defense of any licensed patents against challenge by a third party. Our agreements with Kissei and Merck Serono give
	our licensors the first right to defend such validity challenges. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be defended in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.&nbsp;If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion

	Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual
	property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those
	relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign
	jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent
	applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly,
	our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our
	intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to
	protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets.

	Additionally, the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly

	We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, trade secrets
	or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property
	litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim
	proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common shares.

	Periodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over
	the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent
	lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in
	partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits,
	non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would harm
	our business.

	of companies governed by the U.S. laws. In the performance of its duties, our board of directors is required by Swiss law to consider the interests of our company, our shareholders, our employees and other stakeholders, in all cases with due
	observation of the principles of reasonableness and fairness. It is possible that some of these parties will have interests that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. Swiss corporate law limits the ability of our
	shareholders to challenge resolutions made or other actions taken by our board of directors in court. Our shareholders generally are not permitted to file a suit to reverse a decision or an action taken by our board of directors but are instead only
	permitted to seek damages for breaches of fiduciary duty. As a matter of Swiss law, shareholder claims against a member of our board of directors for breach of fiduciary duty would have to be brought in Geneva, Switzerland, or where the relevant
	member of our board of directors is domiciled. In addition, under Swiss law, any claims by our shareholders against us must be brought exclusively in Geneva, Switzerland. Class actions and derivative actions as such are not available under Swiss
	law. In addition, Swiss corporation law restricts our ability to implement rights plans or U.S.-style &#147;poison pills.&#148; Since the Swiss takeover rules do not apply to us, our ability to resist an unsolicited takeover attempt may be limited.

	We are a Swiss stock corporation, and our jurisdiction of

	persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or upon such persons or to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts,
	including judgments in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Switzerland of original
	actions, or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities to the extent predicated upon the federal and state securities laws of the United States. Original actions against persons in Switzerland based solely upon the
	U.S. federal or state securities laws are governed, among other things, by the principles set forth in the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law. This statute provides that the application of provisions of non-Swiss law by the courts in
	Switzerland shall be precluded if the result is incompatible with Swiss public policy. Also, mandatory provisions of Swiss law may be applicable regardless of any other law that would otherwise apply.

	Swiss law reserves for approval by
	shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. For example, the payment of dividends and cancellation of treasury shares must be approved by shareholders. Swiss law also
	requires that our shareholders themselves resolve to, or authorize our board of directors to, increase our share capital. While our shareholders may authorize share capital that can be issued by our board of directors without additional shareholder
	approval, Swiss law limits this authorization to 50% of the issued share capital at the time of the authorization. The authorization, furthermore, has a limited duration of up to two years and must be renewed by the shareholders from time to time
	thereafter in order to be available for raising capital. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including exceptions explicitly described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants pre-emptive rights to existing shareholders to
	subscribe for new issuances of shares. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various rights and regulations that can attach to different classes of shares as do the laws of some other jurisdictions. These Swiss law requirements
	relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided benefits to our shareholders. See the sections of this prospectus entitled &#147;Description of Share Capital and

	authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; (2) the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from

	the occurrence of specified significant events. In addition, foreign private issuers are not required to file their annual report on Form 20-F until four months after the end of each financial year, while U.S. domestic issuers that are accelerated
	filers are required to file their annual report on Form 10-K within 75 days after the end of each fiscal year. Foreign private issuers are also exempt from the Regulation Fair Disclosure, aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures

	certain requirements regarding the solicitation of proxies. Furthermore, in accordance with Swiss law and generally accepted business practices, our articles of association do not provide quorum requirements generally applicable to general meetings
	of shareholders. Our practice thus varies from the requirement of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5620(c), which requires an issuer to provide in its bylaws for a generally applicable quorum, and that such quorum may not be less than one-third of the

	We are currently a foreign private issuer and therefore, following the consummation of this offering, we will not be required to comply with
	all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.&nbsp;In order to maintain our current status as a foreign private issuer, either (1) a majority of our common shares must be
	either directly or indirectly owned of record by non-residents of the United States or (2)(a) a majority of our executive officers or directors may not be United States citizens or residents, (b) more than 50% of our assets cannot be located in the
	United States and (c) our business must be administered principally outside the United States. If we lost this status, we would be required to comply with the Exchange Act reporting and other requirements applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, which
	are more detailed and extensive than the requirements for foreign private issuers. We may also be required to make changes in our corporate governance practices in accordance with various SEC and stock exchange rules. The regulatory and compliance
	costs to us under U.S. securities laws if we are required to comply with the reporting requirements applicable to a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly higher than the cost we would incur as a foreign private issuer. As a result, we expect
	that a loss of foreign private issuer status would increase our legal and financial compliance costs and would make some activities highly time-consuming and costly. If we lose our foreign private issuer status and are unable to devote adequate
	funding and the resources needed to maintain compliance with U.S. securities laws, while continuing our operations, we could be forced to deregister with the SEC. A deregistration would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of
	our securities in the United States. We also expect that if we were required to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, it would make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability
	insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of

	This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our
	current plans and business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of

	As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be
	relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of those net proceeds. Pending these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing deposits.

	Based on the planned use of proceeds described above, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our current cash and cash
	equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for more than 12 months. We anticipate these funds will be sufficient for the completion of our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of OBE2109
	in patients with endometriosis, the initiation of our two Phase 3 clinical trials of OBE2109 in patients with uterine fibroids, the initiation and completion of our European Phase 3 clinical trial of OBE001 in women undergoing IVF and the completion
	of our Phase 1 and DDI clinical trials and the subsequent initiation and completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE022 for the treatment of preterm labor. We anticipate that we will need additional funds to complete our two Phase 3 clinical
	trials of OBE2109 in patients with uterine fibroids. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

	Since our incorporation, we have never paid a dividend, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to
	retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business. As a result, investors in our common shares will benefit in the foreseeable future only if our common shares appreciate in value.

	Under Swiss law, any dividend must be proposed by our board of directors and approved by a shareholders&#146; meeting. In addition, our
	auditors must confirm that the dividend proposal of our board of directors conforms to Swiss statutory law and our articles of association. A Swiss corporation may pay dividends only if it has sufficient distributable profits brought forward from
	the previous business years or if it has distributable reserves, each as evidenced by its audited stand-alone statutory balance sheet prepared pursuant to Swiss law and after allocations to reserves required by Swiss law and its articles of
	association have been deducted. Distributable reserves are generally booked either as &#147;retained earnings&#148; (

	The table above assumes no exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional common shares in
	this offering. If the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional common shares is exercised in full, the number of common shares held by existing shareholders would be reduced to 75% of the total number of common shares outstanding after this
	offering, and the number of common shares held by new investors participating in the offering would be increased to 25% of the total number of common shares outstanding after this offering.

	The tables and discussion above do not include 4,172,623 common shares that may be issued from our conditional share capital to cover equity
	grants awarded under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, which will become effective prior to the completion of this offering.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To the extent
	that options are exercised, new options are issued under our equity incentive plan, or we issue additional common shares or convertible securities in the future, there will be further dilution to investors participating in this offering. In
	addition, we may choose to raise additional capital because of market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If we raise additional capital through the sale
	of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our shareholders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Certain
	of our existing shareholders and their affiliated entities have indicated an interest in purchasing up to an aggregate of $30.0 million of our common shares in this offering at the initial public offering price per share. Based on an assumed initial
	public offering price of $15.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, these entities would purchase up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 of the 6,450,000 shares in this offering based on these
	indications of interest. However, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, these entities may determine to purchase fewer shares than they indicate an interest in purchasing or not to purchase any shares
	in this offering. It is also possible that these entities could indicate an interest in purchasing more of our common shares. In addition, the underwriters could determine to sell fewer shares to any of these entities than the entities indicate an
	interest in purchasing or not to sell any shares to these entities. The foregoing discussion and tables do not reflect any potential purchases by these entities or their affiliated entities.

	We are a
	clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman&#146;s reproductive health and pregnancy. We are focused on providing therapeutic
	solutions for women between the ages of 15 and 49 who suffer from reproductive health conditions that affect their quality of life, ability to conceive or that complicate pregnancy and the health of newborns.&nbsp;Our goal is to build the leading
	women&#146;s reproductive health and pregnancy company focused on conditions where current treatment options are limited and significant unmet needs exist.

	We are developing OBE2109 as a novel, oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH, receptor antagonist, for the treatment of pain associated
	with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women. We are currently conducting a multiple-dose, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109 in patients with endometriosis, with a
	target enrollment of 330 patients.&nbsp;We expect to report data from the first 24-week evaluation period of this trial in the first half of 2018. For the uterine fibroids indication, we intend to commence a Phase&nbsp;3 clinical development program
	with two Phase 3 clinical trials in the first half of 2017. We expect to report data from these Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials in the first half of 2020. We are also developing OBE001 (nolasiban), an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist, to improve
	clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing in vitro fertilization, or IVF. We intend to initiate a European Phase 3 clinical trial in women undergoing IVF in the first half of 2017 and expect to report data for the primary endpoint
	in the second quarter of 2018.&nbsp;In addition, we are developing OBE022 an oral and selective prostaglandin F

	antagonist, as a once daily treatment for preterm labor in weeks 24 to 34 of pregnancy. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability and PK profile of OBE022 in healthy post-menopausal female volunteers
	after single doses of 10 mg to 1,300 mg and multiple doses between 100 mg per day and 1,000 mg per day over 7 consecutive days. Based on preliminary data, OBE022 was observed to have a favorable safety profile and to be well-tolerated at doses up to
	1,300 mg after single dose administration and up to 1,000 mg per day after multiple dose administration over 7 days, each of which are above the estimated clinical effective dose.

	We were founded in November 2012 and our operations to date have included organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, in-licensing
	rights to OBE2109, OBE001 and OBE022 and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales as none of our product candidates have been approved for commercialization. We have
	historically financed our operations exclusively through the sale of equity. As of September&nbsp;30, 2016, we have raised an aggregate of $93.2&nbsp;million of gross proceeds and also acquired license rights on product candidates from the sale of

	Research and development expenses increased by $3.6 million during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
	2016 compared to the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 primarily due to the increased costs of $5.5 million resulting from the initiation of our Phase 2b clinical trial with OBE2109 in endometriosis, increased costs of $1.6 million resulting

	Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations.&nbsp;We have
	funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity. From inception through September&nbsp;30, 2016, we have raised an aggregate of $93.2&nbsp;million of gross proceeds from the sale of preferred shares. As of September&nbsp;30, 2016, we had

	Our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses, primarily research and
	development expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. We currently have no ongoing material
	financing commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees.

	We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing
	activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product
	candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to program sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of potential
	collaborators. Furthermore, following the completion of this offering, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our
	continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.

	We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the net proceeds from this offering, will enable us to fund our operating
	expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12&nbsp;months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our

	Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial

	We recognize expenses incurred in carrying out our research and development activities in line with our best estimation of the stage of
	completion of each separately contracted study or activity. This includes the calculation of research and development accruals at each period to account for expenditure that has been incurred. This requires us to estimate of the full costs to
	complete each study or activity and to estimate the current stage of completion. There have been no material adjustments to estimates based on the actual costs incurred for the periods presented. In all cases, we expense the full cost of each study
	or activity by the time the final study report or, where applicable, product, has been received.

	research and development expenditure incurred prior to achieving such approvals as it is incurred. None of our product candidates have yet received regulatory and marketing approvals.

	We test assets for impairment in accordance with International Accounting Standard, or IAS, 36
	Impairment of Assets. IAS 36 outlines that an impairment loss must be recognized if an asset&#146;s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset&#146;s fair value less costs to sell and its value
	in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets
	(cash-generating units). The recoverable amounts of our assets and cash-generating units have been determined based on fair value less costs to sell calculations, which require the use of certain assumptions.

	We were founded in November
	2012 by former executives of PregLem SA, or PregLem, a Swiss-based specialty biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative drugs for women&#146;s reproductive medicine. While at PregLem, our senior
	management team collaborated in the clinical development and commercialization of several women&#146;s reproductive health therapeutics, including Esmya (ulipristal acetate) for the treatment of uterine fibroids. PregLem was subsequently acquired by
	Gedeon Richter in 2010.&nbsp;We believe we will be able to leverage our senior management team&#146;s long-standing experience working together and with key opinion leaders, patient groups, payors, reproductive health networks, fertility clinics,
	obstetricians and gynecologists, or OB/GYNs, nurses and pharmacists to identify, in-license or acquire, develop and commercialize product candidates. We are merging our passion for, and extensive experience in, the field of women&#146;s reproductive

	OBE2109 for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids

</B>
	. We are developing OBE2109 as a novel, oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or
	GnRH, receptor antagonist, for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women.&nbsp;Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which the tissue that
	normally lines the inside of the uterus, called the endometrium, grows outside of the uterus, causing monthly bleeding and chronic inflammatory reactions inside the abdomen that may result in ovarian cyst formation, scar tissue and adhesions. The
	symptoms of endometriosis include significant pain during menstrual periods, chronic pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, excessive menstrual bleeding and infertility. These symptoms can impact general physical, mental and social well-being. As of
	2014, we believe that approximately 2.5 million women in the United States were diagnosed and being treated for endometriosis and that the majority of those women experience significant pain during menstrual periods. Uterine fibroids are common
	non-cancerous tumors that develop in the muscular wall of the uterus and have disabling symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding. According to a study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology in 2003, uterine fibroids affect
	an estimated 20 to 40% of women over the age of 30 in the United States based on clinical cases and women who undergo treatment.

	dose-dependent suppression of estradiol and a dose range that was well-tolerated and provided symptom relief. We are currently conducting a multiple-dose, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109 in patients with endometriosis, with a
	target enrollment of 330 patients, which we refer to as the EDELWEISS trial.&nbsp;We expect to report data from the first 24-week evaluation period of the EDELWEISS trial in the first half of 2018. For the uterine fibroids indication, we plan to
	perform a Phase 1 PK and PD clinical trial to assess two different doses of add-back therapy in patients receiving 100 mg and 200 mg doses of OBE2109 over six weeks. We expect that the results of this clinical trial, which we expect to receive in
	the first half of 2017, will confirm the selection of the add-back therapy dose or doses planned in the two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials that we intend to commence in the first half of 2017.&nbsp;We refer to these Phase 3
	clinical trials of OBE2109 in patients with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids as the PRIMROSE clinical trials. The PRIMROSE clinical trials will each have a target enrollment of approximately 500 patients. We expect to report
	data from the PRIMROSE clinical trials in the first half of 2020. We believe OBE2109, if approved in either indication, has the potential to be a best-in-class oral GnRH receptor antagonist based on its favorable PK and pharmacodynamic, or PD,
	profiles, and its expected balance between safety and efficacy.&nbsp;We expect OBE2109 to potentially&nbsp;reduce pain symptoms associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, while mitigating bone
	mineral density loss and other adverse effects associated with excessive estradiol suppression.&nbsp;Further, we believe that OBE2109 has the potential to offer personalized dosing that can be tailored to a patient&#146;s individual
	response.&nbsp;Finally, we believe OBE2109 has certain advantageous characteristics including the absence of food effect, high bioavailability, low volume of distribution, and low PK and PD variability.&nbsp;We believe these characteristics could be
	key product differentiators compared to other GnRH receptor antagonists in clinical development.

	. We are developing OBE001 (nolasiban), an oral oxytocin

	achieve pregnancy through the collection of mature eggs in the ovaries, followed by fertilization and early embryo development in the laboratory before transfer of the embryos into the womb. In Europe, approximately 620,000 IVF treatments were

	approximately 33% in the United States and 21% in Europe. In 2016, we completed our 247-patient Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE001 in women undergoing IVF.&nbsp;OBE001 did not reach the primary endpoint of a statistically significant increase in
	pregnancy rate at six weeks after embryo transfer, or ET.&nbsp;In our post-hoc analysis of the data, which excluded patients with progesterone levels in the top quartile of the patient pool, we identified a statistically significant
	dose-proportional increase in pregnancy rate at 10 weeks and live birth rate. We believe that high progesterone levels can lead to a premature closing of the embryo implantation window. Based on these results, we intend to initiate a European Phase
	3 clinical trial in women undergoing IVF in the first half of 2017 and expect to report data for the primary endpoint in the second quarter of 2018.

	pregnancy. Preterm labor can lead to preterm birth, which is currently the leading worldwide cause of death of newborn babies. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, approximately 9.6% of babies in the United States were born

	receptor, OBE022 is designed to control preterm labor by reducing inflammation, decreasing
	uterine contractions and preventing cervical changes and fetal membrane ruptures. Based on its PK profile and efficacy observed in animal models, we believe OBE022 has the potential to become a first-in-class therapy to suppress preterm labor and
	delay or avoid preterm birth, without significant safety concerns for the fetus. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability and PK profile of OBE022 in healthy post-menopausal female volunteers after
	single doses of 10 mg to 1,300 mg and multiple doses between 100 mg per day and 1,000 mg per day over 7&nbsp;consecutive days. Based on preliminary data, OBE022 was observed to have a favorable safety profile and to be well-tolerated at doses up to
	1,300 mg after single dose administration and up to 1,000&nbsp;mg per day after multiple dose administration over 7 days, each of which are above the estimated clinical effective dose.

	Endometriosis is a painful disorder in which the endometrium grows outside of the uterus, typically on the lining of the pelvis, on the
	ovaries, in the rectovaginal septum, on the bladder, and in the bowels. Endometriosis causes monthly bleeding and chronic inflammatory reactions in the abdomen that may result in ovarian cyst formation, scar tissue and adhesions.&nbsp;The symptoms
	of endometriosis include significant pain during menstrual periods, chronic pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, excessive menstrual bleeding and infertility which in turn can impact general physical, mental and social well-being. Often the pain
	associated with endometriosis is cyclical in nature and reflects the response to reproductive hormones circulating throughout the body, particularly estrogen. Endometriosis is also one of the leading causes of infertility.&nbsp;In many instances,
	endometriosis is only diagnosed when women seek treatment for such infertility.

	The exact causes of endometriosis and uterine fibroids are not currently understood.&nbsp;However, several factors can contribute to their
	development and progression, including the rise and fall of hormones, particularly estrogen, mainly in the form of estradiol.&nbsp;The production of estrogen in the body is regulated by GnRH.&nbsp;GnRH is responsible for stimulating the synthesis
	and release of luteinizing hormone, or LH, and follicle stimulating hormone, or FSH, by the pituitary gland.&nbsp;LH and FSH in turn drive estrogen production through stimulation of the ovaries.&nbsp;Estradiol is the hormone that, among other
	effects, causes the endometrium inside the uterus to thicken during the menstrual cycle.&nbsp;Similarly, estradiol has been determined to promote the growth of endometriosis lesions and uterine fibroids.&nbsp;Various pharmacological treatments
	directed at addressing endometriosis and uterine fibroids attempt to regulate the production of estrogen, particularly estradiol, by controlling the activity of GnRH.

	For

	improve fertility. Oral contraceptives, progestins and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, are generally first-line treatments for women experiencing pain.&nbsp;Following the failure of first-line therapies, current treatment options

	endometriosis range from laparoscopy to more complex open abdominal surgery.&nbsp;If a woman has not responded to other medical or surgical treatments, a radical hysterectomy, which is the removal of all or part of the uterus and the ovaries may be

	embolization, which is a procedure to obstruct the arteries nurturing the fibroid, performed by arterial catheterization, and (3) if the dominant symptom is bleeding, endometrial ablation, which is a procedure to remove the inner layer of the uterus
	performed by thermic or ultrasonic process.&nbsp;According to a study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology in 2012, approximately 200,000 hysterectomies and 30,000 myomectomies are performed annually for the treatment of

	from Kissei, we submitted an IND for OBE2109 in May 2016, which was accepted by the FDA. We are currently conducting the multiple-dose, placebo-controlled Phase 2b EDELWEISS clinical trial of OBE2109 in 330 endometriosis patients in the United

	In the Phase 1 clinical trial, OBE2109 was observed to have a favorable safety profile and to be
	well-tolerated up to 400 mg once daily for seven days. Additionally, OBE2109 had a linear PK profile, a half-life of approximately 15 hours and no significant differences between women of Japanese and European descent. Moreover, OBE2109 was observed
	to have a low volume of distribution, meaning the drug remained in the blood and did not accumulate in fatty tissue, and a dose-proportional response shown in the Figure 1 below. Furthermore, in the Phase 1 clinical trial, there was no food effect
	observed.&nbsp;OBE2109 was observed to induce a dose-dependent decrease in LH and FSH over time, which we believe correlates with the ability of OBE2109 to control estradiol levels in a dose-dependent manner. Based on the low PK variability and lack
	of dose overlap observed in the Phase 1 clinical trial, we believe we will be able to more tightly control biological response with personalized doses of OBE2109.

	were moderate in severity and none were severe.&nbsp;No serious adverse events were reported in the KLH1203 trial. A single serious adverse event was observed in each of the KLH1201 and KLH1202 trials and both were determined by the principal
	investigators to be unrelated to OBE2109.

	Based on feedback we received from the FDA in November 2016, we intend to commence the two PRIMROSE
	Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in the first half of 2017. The PRIMROSE clinical trials will each have a target enrollment of approximately 500 patients. One of the trials will be
	conducted in the United States and the other trial will be conducted in the United States and in Europe. We expect to report data from these PRIMROSE Phase 3 clinical trials in the first half of 2020. We also plan to perform a Phase 1 PK and PD
	clinical trial to assess two different doses of add-back therapy in patients receiving 100 mg and 200 mg doses of OBE2109 over six weeks. We expect that the results of this clinical trial, which we expect to receive in the first half of 2017, will
	confirm the selection of the add-back therapy dose or doses planned in the PRIMROSE clinical trials. We believe that a 100 mg dose of OBE2109 could control symptoms in a significant proportion of patients without requiring add-back therapy. We also
	intend to further assess the efficacy of a 200&nbsp;mg dose of OBE2109 both with and without add-back therapy. We believe that the 200 mg dose will require add-back therapy to prevent excessive bone mineral density loss. In addition, in 2016 we
	completed a Phase 1 trial to assess the impact of OBE2109 on the potential induction of a liver enzyme known as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which is responsible for the metabolism of add-back back therapy. In this trial, we observed no relevant
	CYP3A4 induction, which we believe means that OBE2109 will not interfere with add-back therapy.

	The IVF process has an overall live birth rate of approximately 33% in the United States and 21% in Europe. The success of IVF depends on the
	quality of the embryo, the transfer procedure and ultimately the receptivity of the uterus.&nbsp;In order for the embryo transfer to be successful, it is important for the uterus to be receptive to embryo implantation, which includes a proper
	hormonal environment, appropriate blood flow within the uterus, and minimal uterine contractions at the time of embryo transfer. The endometrium is the inner layer of the uterus that is in direct contact with the implanting embryo. Uterine
	contractions occur throughout the course of a woman&#146;s menstrual cycle and the frequency and intensity of the contractions depend on the phase of the cycle.&nbsp;In a study published in Human Reproduction in 1998, after IVF, the rate of uterine

	Oxytocin is a hormone that is secreted by the pituitary gland. Oxytocin receptors are present on the uterus smooth muscle cells, the
	endometrium and the uterus arteries. The release of oxytocin by the pituitary gland activates oxytocin receptors, which results in uterine contractions. As shown in the graphic below, blocking the activation of the uterine oxytocin receptors at the
	time of embryo transfer may enhance uterine receptivity by decreasing uterine contractions, improving uterine blood flow and enhancing the receptivity of the endometrium to embryo implantation, which can lead to increased clinical pregnancy and live
	birth rates.

	A systematic review and meta-analysis of investigator-sponsored trials conducted in 2014 and published in
	Fertility &amp; Sterility concluded that pregnancy rates doubled with the infusion of an oxytocin receptor antagonist at the time of embryo transfer. As part of this analysis, it was observed that improvement in pregnancy rates was not restricted to
	women with a high rate of uterine contractions. According to this analysis, additional mechanisms, such as endometrium receptivity and uterine blood flow, may also contribute to improving pregnancy rates. In a recent trial published in 2016
	involving patients with endometriosis undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer, clinical pregnancy rates were approximately 20% higher after treatment with an oxytocin receptor antagonist, representing a 51% increase relative to the placebo.&nbsp;In
	addition, according to studies published in Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics in 2011, women who received an oxytocin receptor antagonist after embryo transfer, were observed, based on three dimensional power doppler ultrasound, to have improved
	characteristics for uterine receptivity, including enhanced endometrial blood flow.

	OBE001 was discovered and initially developed by Merck Serono.&nbsp;Following our in-license of OBE001 from Merck Serono in 2013,
	we submitted an IND for OBE001, which became effective in January 2015.&nbsp;Under that IND, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE001 in 2016.&nbsp;Though OBE001 did not reach the primary endpoint of a statistically significant increase in
	pregnancy rate six weeks after the ET based on our post-hoc analysis of the Phase 2 data excluding patients with progesterone levels in the top quartile of the patient pool, we identified a statistically significant dose-proportional increase in
	ongoing pregnancy rate at week 10 and live birth rate, with both having an absolute increase of up to 20%, equivalent to a 67% relative increase to the placebo.&nbsp;Beginning in the first half of 2017, we intend to initiate a European Phase 3
	clinical trial in women undergoing IVF to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of OBE001. Our IND for OBE001 is currently inactive following the Phase 2 clinical trial, but we intend to reactivate the IND after discussions with the FDA if the

	Following our receipt of the initial data, we reviewed the patients&#146; characteristics within each of
	the dose groups. From this review, we discovered that patients in the 300 mg group demonstrated higher estradiol levels and higher progesterone levels prior to embryo transfer than in the other groups. We believe that high estradiol levels are
	responsible for the earlier expression of progesterone receptors, which induce advancement of endometrial maturation, and that high progesterone levels can lead to a premature closing of the embryo implantation window, preventing or impairing the
	embryo implantation. Therefore, we subsequently conducted a post-hoc analysis of the results of the Phase 2 clinical trial, removing patients with a progesterone level in the top quartile of the patient pool. There were 25 patients excluded in this

	In the IMPLANT trial, OBE001 was well tolerated at doses up to 900 mg.&nbsp;Adverse events were reported through 10 weeks following the OPU
	day. Increased doses were not observed to result in increased occurrence of adverse events. The most common adverse events were determined to be related to pregnancy, menstrual bleeding or the IVF procedure and occurred at similar frequencies in the
	placebo and active treatment groups. Serious adverse events were reported in six patients and included ectopic pregnancy in three patients, and adnexal torsion, vaginal hemorrhage and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in one patient each.&nbsp;None
	of these serious adverse events were determined by the investigator to be related to the treatment and none caused trial discontinuation. One patient in the OBE001 900 mg group discontinued participation in the trial due to a non-serious adverse
	event of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which was determined by the investigator to be unrelated to treatment. Only three adverse events, which occurred in patients in the 300 mg group, were considered related to treatment (mild nausea, mild
	dizziness and mild rash), and the patients fully recovered from the adverse events.

	Preterm labor, defined as the body commencing the birthing process prior to 37 weeks, is characterized by
	uterine contractions, cervical dilation and rupture of the fetal membranes that surround and protect the fetus during pregnancy. According to a study published in the Lancet in 2012, approximately 15 million babies were born preterm in 2010,
	accounting for 11.1% of all live births worldwide. In the 65 countries with reliable data for preterm birth, 62 countries had increasing rates of preterm birth over the period from 1990 to 2010. According to the National Center for Health
	Statistics, the United States&#146; preterm birth rate was 9.6% in 2014, which, according to the March of Dimes Foundation, ranks among the worst of high-resource countries. In 2007, the Institute of Medicine reported that the cost associated with

	Reviews of these different classes of tocolytic drugs concluded that prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, also known as NSAIDs, provided the
	best efficacy for delaying labor at 48 hours and seven days. According to a study published in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology in 2009, prostaglandin antagonists were most effective at delaying delivery at 48 hours and seven days among the class of
	drugs available in the United States. Delaying delivery as long as possible up to full term is ideal, but delaying delivery by at least 48 hours is significant because a steroid can be administered to the mother to mature the baby&#146;s lungs so
	the baby can potentially breathe on its own.&nbsp;The table below, which shows the results of that study, displays the percentage of patients that did not deliver a baby at various time points following treatment.

	Preclinical studies have also been conducted to support oral administration of OBE022 in humans. Overall, the toxicological profile of OBE022
	observed in repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs appeared to be benign. We also conducted safety studies to evaluate OBE022 compared to NSAIDs in pregnant rats prior to delivery.&nbsp;In these studies, we observed that the NSAID
	indomethacin induced constriction of the blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery to the aorta and impaired the renal function in the newborn rats, while OBE022 did not. Based on the results of these preclinical studies, we believe that OBE022
	has the potential to be an effective, safer tocolytic agent for the treatment of preterm labor.

	In our current Phase 1 clinical trial, we are assessing the safety, tolerability and PK profile of OBE022 when administered in approximately 70

	is also involved in uterine contractions and the related pain that can occur during normal menstruation in
	non-pregnant women, we are assessing the ability of OBE022 to reduce the intra-uterine pressure and the pelvic pain scores in healthy female volunteers of child bearing age during menstruation. Based on preliminary data from the single doses
	administered of 10 mg to 1,300 mg and multiple doses between 100 mg per day and 1,000 mg per day administered over 7 consecutive days in the Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial, which is ongoing, OBE022 was observed to be readily absorbed and converted into
	the active stable metabolite OBE002. Exposure to OBE002 increased with dose of OBE022 and reached clinically meaningful exposure levels within an hour after administration which is an important feature for orally administered preterm labor
	treatments. To date, median OBE002 half-lives have been observed to be between 7 and 15 hours, which we believe is an adequate half-life for OBE022 to have once daily or twice daily dosing. Preliminary plasma concentration-time data is presented in
	Figure 16 below. To date, single and multiple administrations of OBE022 were well tolerated at all doses. There have been no serious adverse events and no clinically relevant changes in safety parameters.

	supply. In the event of a disruption to Kissei or to a CMO Kissei elects to utilize for OBE2019, we will have no other means of producing OBE2109 until Kissei restores the affected facilities, selects an alternate CMO or we or it procures

	The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding

	requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, may
	oversee some clinical trials. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on

	After we complete the required preclinical, CMC and clinical testing, we can prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA, who must approve the NDA

	detailed information relating to the drug&#146;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials on a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including

	The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether it will accept the
	application for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the
	application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
	The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s continued safety,
	quality and purity. Once the FDA accepts the filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to standard
	review NDAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe is often extended. The FDA reviews most applications for standard review drugs within ten to 12 months and most applications for priority review drugs within six
	to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists.

	In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain
	data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe
	and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric
	data requirements.

	The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of
	safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee.&nbsp;This is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts that will review, evaluate, and recommend whether the FDA should approve the application. The FDA is not bound by the
	recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP, and will inspect the facility or the facilities
	at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.

	After the FDA evaluates the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports
	regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the FDA has completed its review of the application, and the agency has
	determined that it will not approve the application in its present form.&nbsp;A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional clinical data or other significant, expensive, and
	time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions of the NDA addressing such deficiencies in two or six months, depending on the type of information
	included. Even with the submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.&nbsp;The government may establish additional requirements, including those resulting from new
	legislation, or the FDA&#146;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drugs under development.

	An
	approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that
	the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain
	circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, the FDA may condition approval on substantial post-approval testing
	and surveillance to monitor the drug&#146;s safety or efficacy.

	Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in

	There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects

	In addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United
	States since the ACA was enacted.&nbsp;For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the
	American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been
	heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more

	to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed
	to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.&nbsp;In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers
	will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This measure could reduce the ultimate demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing.

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the
	United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors.
	Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the
	process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a
	particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For example, the payor&#146;s reimbursement payment rate may not be adequate
	or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private
	payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payor&#146;s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage
	for the product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product
	development. Further, some third-party payors may require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they provide reimbursement for use of such therapies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of products and services,
	in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of
	our product.&nbsp;These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product
	after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.&nbsp;Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly.

	The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest
	in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription products. By
	way of example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of products, including, for example, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory
	discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#146; share of sales to federal health care programs. CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. For example,
	the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, set a goal of moving 30% of Medicare payments to alternative payment models tied to the quality or value of services by 2016 and 50% of Medicare payments into these alternative payment models
	by the end of 2018. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our products.

	In the European Community, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national
	health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the
	government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member
	states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high
	barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

	The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party
	payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing.
	Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we attain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and
	reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

	Numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services,
	other divisions of the HHS, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state, and local government authorities, regulate sales, promotion and other activities following product approval. As described above, the FDA regulates all

	Medicaid, make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase
	or prescription of a particular product. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, limited statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, and the scarcity of guidance in the form of regulations, agency advisory opinions, sub-regulatory
	guidance and judicial decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the
	ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to
	violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or
	fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. In addition, private individuals can bring similar actions under the federal civil False Claims Act. False claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil False
	Claims Act, prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed products or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for
	items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws, as well as civil monetary penalties laws
	and the criminal healthcare fraud provisions enacted as part of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines
	and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement, and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring
	requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called &#147;responsible corporate
	officer&#148; doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing.

	Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often

	increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Other healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs
	the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; analogous state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than
	HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of products, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to

	authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that demonstrates &#147;significant clinical benefit&#148; in comparison with existing therapies.&nbsp;This system is usually referred to as &#147;8+2&#148;. Abridged applications cannot rely
	on an innovator&#146;s data until after expiry of the eight year date exclusivity term, meaning that a competitor can file an application for a generic product but the product cannot be marketed until the end of the market exclusivity term.

	Certain of our existing 5% shareholders and their affiliated entities have indicated an interest in purchasing up to an aggregate of
	$30.0&nbsp;million of our common shares in this offering at the initial public offering price per share. Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of
	this prospectus, these entities would purchase up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 of the 6,450,000&nbsp;shares in this offering based on these indications of interest. However, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments
	to purchase, these shareholders may determine to purchase fewer shares than they indicate an interest in purchasing or not to purchase any shares in this offering. It is also possible that these shareholders could indicate an interest in purchasing
	more of our common shares. In addition, the underwriters could determine to sell fewer shares to any of these shareholders than the shareholders indicate an interest in purchasing or not to sell any shares to these shareholders.

	ownership calculations and other information in the following table gives effect to the conversion of all of our outstanding preferred shares and non-voting shares into an aggregate of 20,965,828 common shares immediately prior to the closing of

	Certain of our existing 5%

	indications of interest. However, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, these shareholders may determine to purchase fewer shares than they indicate an interest in purchasing or not to purchase any
	shares in this offering. It is also possible that these shareholders could indicate an interest in purchasing more of our common shares. In addition, the underwriters could determine to sell fewer shares to any of these shareholders than the

	distributed beyond payment of a dividend of 5% must be retained as general reserves. The CO permits us to accrue additional general reserves. Further, a purchase of our own shares (whether by us or a subsidiary) reduces the distributable reserves in

	Distributions out of issued share capital (i.e. the aggregate par value of our issued shares) are not allowed and may be made only by way of a

	report must confirm that claims of our creditors remain fully covered despite the reduction in the share capital recorded in the commercial register. The share capital may be reduced below CHF 100,000 only if and to the extent that at the same time
	the statutory minimum share capital of CHF 100,000 is reestablished by sufficient new fully paid-up capital. Upon approval by the general meeting of shareholders of the capital reduction, the board of directors must give public notice of the capital
	reduction resolution in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce three times and notify creditors that they may request, within two months of the third publication, satisfaction of or security for their claims. The reduction of the share capital may

	Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common shares. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the
	public market could adversely affect market prices prevailing from time to time. Furthermore, because only a limited number of common shares will be available for sale shortly after this offering due to existing contractual and legal restrictions on
	resale as described below, there may be sales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market after such restrictions lapse. This may adversely affect the prevailing market price and our ability to raise equity capital in the

	Upon completion of this offering and the conversion of all of our preferred shares into common shares on a one-for-one basis upon
	the closing of this offering, we will have 29,631,262 common shares outstanding, assuming no exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional common shares and assuming no outstanding options are exercised. Of these shares, the
	common shares sold in this offering will be freely transferable without restriction or registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, except for any common shares purchased by one of our existing
	&#147;affiliates,&#148; as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act and, to the extent that the entities affiliated with Medicxi purchase, in the aggregate, at least the amount of our common shares for which they have indicated an
	interest in purchasing in this offering, the shares purchased by such entities. The remaining common shares existing are &#147;restricted shares&#148; as defined in Rule 144. Restricted shares may be sold in the public market only if registered or
	if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rules 144 or 701 of the Securities Act. After the expiration of the contractual 180-day lock-up period described below, these common shares may be sold in the public market only if registered

	In general, a non-U.S. corporation will be a &#147;passive foreign investment corporation&#148; or &#147;PFIC&#148; for any taxable year in
	which (1)&nbsp;75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income (the &#147;PFIC income test&#148;) or (2)&nbsp;50% or more of the average quarterly value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of,
	passive income (the &#147;PFIC asset test&#148;). For purposes of the above calculations, a non-U.S. corporation that directly or indirectly owns at least 25% (by value) of the shares of another corporation is treated as if it held its proportionate
	share of the assets and received directly its proportionate share of the income of such other corporation. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, certain rents and royalties, and capital gains. Assets that produce, or are held for
	the production of, passive income include cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

	We do not believe that we were a PFIC in
	prior taxable years and we do not expect to be a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2016. However, our operations generate very limited amounts of non-passive income. Until we generate sufficient revenue from active licensing and other
	non-passive sources, there is a risk that we will be a PFIC under the PFIC income test. Moreover, we hold, and expect to continue to hold following this offering, a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents. Because the calculation of the
	value of our assets may be based in part on the value of our common shares, the value of which may fluctuate considerably after this offering, it is difficult to predict whether we will be a PFIC under the PFIC asset test. Even if we determine that
	we are not a PFIC after the close of a taxable year, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, will agree with our conclusion. Because PFIC status is a fact specific determination, and generally cannot be made until the
	close of the taxable year in question, no assurance can be given that we will not be a PFIC for our current taxable year and that we will not be a PFIC in future taxable years. Our United States counsel expresses no opinion with respect to our PFIC
	status for prior years, the current taxable year or any future years.

	discussed below, gain recognized on a disposition (including, under certain circumstances, a pledge) of common shares by the U.S. Holder, or on an indirect disposition of shares of a Lower-tier PFIC, will be allocated ratably over the U.S.
	Holder&#146;s holding period for the shares. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of disposition and to years before we became a PFIC will be taxed as ordinary income arising in the taxable year of disposition. The amounts allocated to each
	other taxable year will be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for that taxable year for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, and an interest charge will be imposed on the tax attributable to the allocated amounts. Further, to the
	extent that any distribution received by a U.S. Holder on our common shares (or a distribution by a Lower-tier PFIC that is deemed to be received by a U.S. Holder) exceeds 125% of the average of the annual distributions with respect to such shares
	received during the preceding three taxable years or the U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period, whichever is shorter, the distribution will be subject to taxation in the same manner as gain on disposition of common shares, described immediately above.

	quantity of the
	common shares is traded on a qualified exchange on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter. The NASDAQ Global Market, on which we plan to list the common shares, is a qualified exchange for this purpose. U.S. Holders should consult their tax
	advisors regarding the availability and advisability of making a mark-to-market election in their particular circumstances. In particular, U.S. Holders should consider carefully the impact of a mark-to-market election with respect to their common

	of any excess of the adjusted tax basis of their common shares over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election). If a U.S.
	Holder makes the election, such holder&#146;s tax basis in their common shares will be adjusted to reflect the income or loss amounts recognized. Any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of common shares in a year when we are a PFIC will

	As

	company rules described above, such distributions, other than certain pro rata distributions of common shares, will be treated as dividends to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal
	income tax principles). Because we do not maintain calculations of our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, it is expected that distributions generally will be reported to U.S. Holders as dividends. The amount of a dividend
	will include any amounts withheld by us in respect of Swiss taxes. The amount of the dividend will be treated as foreign-source dividend income to U.S. Holders and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally available to U.S.
	corporations under the Code. Dividends will be included in a U.S. Holder&#146;s income on the date of the U.S. Holder&#146;s receipt of the dividend. The amount of any dividend income paid in Swiss Francs will be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by
	reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. If the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder should not be required to
	recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. A U.S. Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt.

	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the common shares in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions.&nbsp;In determining the source of shares
	to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option.&nbsp;If
	the underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying shares in the open market.&nbsp;A naked short position is more likely to be created if the

	We are organized under the laws of Switzerland and our jurisdiction of incorporation is Geneva, Switzerland. Moreover, a number of our
	directors and executive officers and a number of directors of each of our subsidiaries are not residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may
	not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or upon such persons or to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts, including judgments in actions predicated upon the civil liability
	provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Switzerland of original actions, or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of
	civil liabilities to the extent predicated upon the federal and state securities laws of the United States. Original actions against persons in Switzerland based solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws are governed, among other things,
	by the principles set forth in the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law of 1987, as amended, or PILA. This statute provides that the application of provisions of non-Swiss law by the courts in Switzerland shall be precluded if the result
	was incompatible with Swiss public policy. Also, mandatory provisions of Swiss law may be applicable regardless of any other law that would otherwise apply.

	Switzerland and the United States do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and
	commercial matters. The recognition and enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the United States in Switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the PILA. This statute provides in principle that a judgment rendered by a non-Swiss court

	private issuers. Accordingly, we will be required to file reports and other information with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 20-F and reports on Form 6-K. Those reports may be inspected without charge at the locations described above. As a
	foreign private issuer, we will be exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act related to the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders will be exempt from the reporting and short-swing
	profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we will not be required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. companies whose
	securities are registered under the Exchange Act. Nevertheless, following this offering, we intend to submit quarterly interim consolidated financial data to the SEC under cover of the SEC&#146;s Form 6-K.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:16PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<B>
	To the Board of Directors of ObsEva SA:
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:16PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion,
	the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, changes in equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ObsEva SA and its subsidiaries at
	December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the
	International Accounting Standards Board. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
	these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
	evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:18PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Emphasis of a Matter
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We draw attention to note 22 of the consolidated financial statements which describes the restatement and reissuance of the consolidated financial statements
	due to a stock split the Company effected on December 8, 2016. Management updated the accompanying financial statements to give retroactive effect to the stock split in the outstanding shares, and the loss per share amounts. We issued our original
	auditor&#146;s report dated October 14, 2016 on the previously issued consolidated financial statements. Due to the restatement described in note 22, we provide this new auditor&#146;s report on the reissued consolidated financial statements. Our
	opinion is not qualified in respect of this matter.

	A share-based, equity-settled, plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) was formally set-up by the Group in 2013. Participants eligible for awards under the Plan are
	executives, directors, employees, agents and consultants. The fair value of the shares granted is determined at each grant date by using either an option pricing method that uses a Black-Scholes model or an hybrid method, as appropriate, both based
	on a combination of the discounted cash flow method, under the income approach, and the backsolve method. When the equity instruments granted do not vest until the counterparty completes a specified period of services, the Group accounts for those
	services as they are rendered by the counterparty, during the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity.

	transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to

	On August 28, 2013, the Group in-licensed OBE001 for USD 4.9 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2015, the Group acquired the in-license for OBE022 for consideration including 325,000 series A preferred shares. The consideration payment is
	contingent on the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial by the Group.

	In accordance with IFRS 2

	, the in-license acquisition
	is measured directly, &#147;at the fair value of the goods or services received, unless that fair value cannot be estimated reliably&#148;.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Considering
	the very early-stage of the product candidate, and the high uncertainty and sensitivity attached to the assumptions used in a fair valuation model of the license received, management deemed that the in-license could not be reliably measured, and
	measured instead the value of the in-license, indirectly, by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result, the Group
	recognised the in-license for an amount of USD 2.4 million, based on (1) its best available estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest and be issued (325,000 series A preferred shares), and (2) the fair value (CHF 6.79) of the
	Company&#146;s equity instruments issued at the transaction date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Management used an income approach to determine the Company&#146;s equity value at the
	transaction date, from which the fair value of the series A preferred share was derived using varying allocation methodologies to each classes of shares.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On November 19, 2015, the Group
	entered into an exclusive in-license and supply agreement with Kissei to acquire the product candidate OBE2109 for which Kissei successfully completed Phase 2 trial in Japan. This in-license agreement grants the Group an exclusive license to use,
	develop and commercialize the product candidate worldwide excluding certain Asian countries.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This in-license was acquired for an upfront cash

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group has concluded that the
	Merck Serono licenses and the Kissei license acquisitions do not qualify as business combinations per IFRS 3, as the Group did not acquire processes that are capable of producing outputs given the in-licensed compounds are very early-stage.

	In accordance with the mandatory Swiss pension fund law, all employees of the
	Company participate in a retirement defined benefit plan. Swiss based pension plans are governed by the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors&#146; and Disability Pension Plans (the &#147;LPP&#148;), which stipulates that pension
	plans are to be managed by independent, legally autonomous units. Under the terms of the pension plan, participants are insured against the financial consequences of old age, disability and death. The various insurance benefits are governed by
	regulations, with the LPP specifying the minimum benefits that are to be provided. The employer and employees pay contributions to the pension plan. In the event the pension plan&#146;s statutory funding falls below a certain level, various measures
	can be taken to increase funding above such level, such as increasing the current contribution, lowering the interest rate on the retirement account balances or reducing the additional prospective benefits. The employer can also make additional
	restructuring contributions. Since the risks of death and disability are fully reinsured by an insurance group, the savings plan must be qualified as a defined benefit plan. As required by IAS 19
<I>
	Employee Benefits

	, the projected unit credit
	method has been used in the calculation of present value of the benefit obligations and the related current service cost.

	The Company has established the Plan for employees, executives, directors and consultants (the &#147;Beneficiaries&#148;) of the Group. This equity-settled
	plan entitles the Beneficiaries to acquire a certain amount of the Company&#146;s non-voting shares at a pre-determined price (1/13 of a Swiss franc). The possibility to enroll in the Plan and acquire shares is generally offered at the hiring date
	as well as on the basis of employees&#146; performance. The Beneficiaries may elect not to participate in the Plan.

	Upon Beneficiaries&#146; enrolment in
	the Plan, Beneficiaries are granted a certain number of shares which they are entitled to acquire. The pre-determined price is generally paid by the Beneficiaries at the grant date and recognized as a pre-payment until the vesting period elapses
	resulting in the shares issuance being accounted for.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The shares generally fully vest over a four year vesting period, with 25% of the shares underlying

	The shareholders&#146; agreement signed in 2013 includes specific anti-dilution clauses benefiting one of the Group&#146;s founders, Ernest Loumaye (the
	&#147;Founder&#148;). Subject to specified exceptions, per this clause, if, as a result of a share issuance, the Founder&#146;s shareholding in the Group&#146;s certain classes of shares is diluted below 10%, then the Founder is entitled to acquire
	at nominal value (1/13 of a Swiss franc) a number of common shares allowing him to maintain his shareholding at 10%.

	As of the date of the approval of the consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors, the Group plans (although is not contractually committed) to
	start a number of additional late-stage clinical trials in the first half of 2017. The Group has accordingly revised its financing plans to fulfill its obligations under the expected development plan, primarily through the sale of equity or
	equity-related instruments. The Group also prepared contingency plans such as the potential deferral of the aforementioned clinical trials, in case the Group is unable to raise such additional funds.

	payment to Merck Serono of the 325,000 series A preferred shares due upon occurrence of that event. The 325,000 shares were issued through an ordinary capital increase of the Group on September 28, 2016.

	The unaudited nine-month consolidated interim financial statements (the &#147;interim financial statements&#148;)
	are prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (&#147;IAS&#148;) 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the &#147;IASB&#148;). The accounting policies used in the preparation and
	presentation of the consolidated interim financial statements are consistent with those used in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 (the &#147;annual financial statements&#148;).

	The Group fulfills its obligations by the use of its cash reserves. As of the date of the approval of the unaudited
	consolidated interim financial statements by the Board of Directors, the Group plans to start a number of additional late-stage clinical trials in the first half of 2017. The Group has therefore revised its financing plans to fulfill its obligations
	under the expected development plan, primarily through the sale of equity or equity-related instruments. The Group also prepared contingency plans, including the potential deferral of the aforementioned clinical trials, in case it is unable to raise
	such additional funds. Therefore the Group believes it will be able to meet all of its obligations as they fall due for a further 12 months from September&nbsp;30, 2016, hence, the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements have been
	prepared on a going concern basis.

	benefits referred to in clause (i)&nbsp;above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
	as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (after
	deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to,
	among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties&#146; relative
	intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of

	Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were
	offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
	(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters&#146; obligations in this subsection (d)&nbsp;to contribute are several in
	proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the
	Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 10(d).
