</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are an
	innovative biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that treat diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, a set of pathways that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking
	and clearance. Leveraging our unique and comprehensive expertise of the proteostasis network, we have developed the Disease Relevant Translation, or DRT, technology platform, a validated drug screening approach for identifying highly translatable
	therapeutics based on predictive and functionally pertinent phenotypic assays and disease relevant models. Using this proprietary platform, we identified a new class of small molecules, which we call amplifiers, that modulate proteins in the
	proteostasis network. Our initial therapeutic focus is cystic fibrosis, or CF, which is caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, protein and insufficient CFTR protein function. We are initially
	developing and intend to commercialize our lead amplifier of CFTR protein, PTI-428, to improve CFTR protein function.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is presently
	no cure for CF. CF affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide with the vast majority of the identified patients residing in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. CF is a progressive disease and the most common fatal
	inherited disease among Caucasians. Without normal CFTR protein activity, thick mucus accumulates in vital organs, particularly the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, and causes many complications, including respiratory infections, chronic
	lung inflammation, poor absorption of nutrients and in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, hours of self-care, and frequent hospitalizations. In 2014, the median age of
	death in the United States from CF was 29 years.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead product candidate PTI-428 is an orally bioavailable CFTR modulator belonging to
	the amplifier class. CFTR modulators are compounds that affect the folding, trafficking and clearance of CFTR protein and can be classified according to the ways in which they affect CFTR protein. Amplifiers, which include PTI-428, are CFTR
	modulators that selectively increase the amount of an immature form of CFTR protein, thereby providing additional substrate for other CFTR modulators, such as correctors and potentiators, to act upon. Correctors, such as lumacaftor or VX-661, are
	believed to improve protein folding and trafficking to enable abnormally folded CFTR protein to achieve some level of activity without repairing the actual protein. Potentiators, such as ivacaftor, are believed to increase the opening time of the
	CFTR protein channel resulting in higher ion flow across the cell membrane. Using industry-standard
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	studies, we have demonstrated that co-administration of PTI-428 with these other CFTR modulators significantly improves the
<I>
	in
	vitro
</I>
	CFTR protein activity achieved by these CFTR modulators alone. Due to the unique ability of amplifiers to selectively increase the amount of an immature form of CFTR protein and its synergistic mechanism of action with certain other types
	of CFTR modulators, we believe that our amplifiers could become the anchor therapeutic agent for combination therapies comprising multiple classes of CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	With the recent advent of CFTR modulators, the CF treatment paradigm is shifting from palliative care, which addresses only the symptoms of
	CF, to disease-modifying agents that target the genetic mutations and protein dysfunction that cause the disease. We are developing and intend to commercialize PTI-428 for CF patients with an F508del mutation of the CFTR gene, the most common CFTR
	gene mutation. In the United States, approximately 87% of all CF patients have an F508del mutation of the CFTR gene, of which approximately 55% are homozygous (having two copies of the F508del mutation), and approximately 45% are heterozygous
	(having an F508del mutation and one other mutation).

	Our analyses of published data by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, of
	its CFTR modulators (the potentiator ivacaftor and the correctors lumacaftor and VX-661) and combinations thereof, show a strong correlation between the
<I>

	CFTR protein activity and lung function improvement. We have shown

	drug application, or IND, that we submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate our PTI-428 product candidate became effective. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first quarter
	of 2016, expect to have preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data from the Phase 1 clinical trial available in the first half of 2016 and aim to complete the Phase 1 clinical trial with the final report by the end of 2016. If
	our Phase 1 clinical trial results are favorable, we plan to initiate our Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2016 with proof of concept data expected to be available in the first half of 2017.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have exclusive worldwide commercial rights to PTI-428. Initially, we plan to pursue regulatory approval for PTI-428 in regions where
	ivacaftor and lumacaftor are commercially available. Given the well-characterized and clearly identified patient populations with CF in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia, we plan to independently commercialize PTI-428 in those regions.
	Outside of those regions, we may seek a partner to commercialize our products. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and advocacy groups, as well as provide patients with support programs, ensure product access and
	secure reimbursement.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are leveraging our DRT technology platform to design and develop our own correctors and potentiators that are
	optimized to work more synergistically with our amplifiers than third-party CFTR modulators. Internal screening against our own proprietary amplifiers has identified a number of novel proprietary correctors and potentiators that, when tested as a
	triple combination of corrector, potentiator and amplifier, restored
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	CFTR protein activity to between 80% and 100% of normal in patient-derived human bronchial epithelial, or HBE, cells homozygous for F508del. There is significant
	potential for improvement in clinical outcomes beyond existing treatments and therapies presently in clinical development for the treatment of CF. We believe that the treatment paradigm in CF for the vast majority of patients will be based on
	combination therapies of CFTR modulators anchored by our amplifiers.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are using our platform to independently explore the activity of
	other CFTR modulators in additional respiratory-related diseases. PTI-130 is a novel small molecule CFTR modulator that we are developing for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, a progressive disorder characterized by
	poor airflow. COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We believe the mechanism of action of PTI-130 can be complementary to drugs currently approved or in development for COPD. In order to further the development of PTI-130, we
	plan to collaborate with one or more biopharmaceutical companies that have capabilities in COPD development.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, we have
	partnered with major pharmaceutical companies for indications with large patient populations. Our Usp14 program with Biogen New Ventures Inc. (formerly Biogen Idec New Ventures Inc.), or Biogen, is intended to enhance the clearance of misfolded
	aggregation-prone proteins in neurodegenerative diseases, such as in Alzheimer&#146;s and Parkinson&#146;s disease. We have announced the achievement of our initial preclinical milestone in July 2014, and we continue to make progress in seeking
	orally available, potent, selective and brain-penetrant inhibitors of Usp14 as candidates for evaluation in the IND-enabling safety assessment studies required for transition to the clinic. Our unfolded protein response, or UPR, program with
	Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, is intended to reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, which is observed in many diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network and characterized by defects in
	protein folding, trafficking and clearance, including genetic, neurodegenerative and retinal degenerative diseases. We are presently using our DRT technology platform to identify selective UPR activators and plan to initiate preclinical development
	in 2017.

	CF is an orphan disease that affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide, with the vast majority of affected individuals in the
	United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. CF is the most common fatal inherited disease in Caucasians. The incidence of CF varies across the globe. CF affects one out of 3,500 births in the United States, one out of 2,000 to 3,000 in Europe, and
	one out of 2,500 in Australia.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is presently no cure for CF. It is a progressive disease caused by a deficiency in CFTR protein
	activity, resulting in the accumulation of thick mucus in vital organs, particularly the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. As a result, CF patients experience, among many other conditions, respiratory infections, chronic lung inflammation,
	poor absorption of nutrients and, in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. Although the life expectancy of CF patients has improved, the median age of death in the United States in 2014 was only 29 years, with a vast majority of such deaths
	resulting from respiratory failure.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, hours of self-care, frequent
	hospitalizations and lung transplants, which if available, are life-extending but not curative. In the United States, estimated lifetime cost of care for CF patients not eligible for ivacaftor ranges from $1.1 to $2.3 million, including $50,000 to
	$63,000 per year in direct healthcare expenditures and substantial additional costs for frequent hospitalizations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These estimates
	exclude the estimated $300,000 annual cost of ivacaftor, marketed by Vertex as Kalydeco, and the estimated $250,000 annual cost of a combination therapy composed of ivacaftor and lumacaftor, marketed by Vertex as Orkambi. As of the end of the third
	quarter of 2015, more than 3,000 eligible patients in the United States have started the treatment with Orkambi, with product sales totaling $131 million for that quarter. In 2014, CF treatments in the United States and major markets in the European
	Union, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, were estimated to cost approximately $1.4 billion, of which approximately $431 million was attributed to sales of ivacaftor. It is projected that in 2018, the market for CF
	therapeutics will exceed $5 billion, of which more than $4.3 billion will be attributable to CFTR modulators, including Kalydeco and Orkambi.

	CF is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes CFTR protein, which plays a critical role in regulating the
	viscosity of the mucus layer that lines human organs. CFTR protein regulates the flow of ions in and out of the cells of vital organs such as the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. We refer to this as ion flow. When CFTR protein expels the
	ions, osmosis draws water out of the cell and hydrates the cell surface. Through regulation of the location of the ions across the cell membrane, the amount of salts in the fluid both inside and outside the cell remains balanced.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In CF patients, the CFTR gene is defective, and as a result, CF patients lack the functional CFTR protein necessary to regulate ion flow.
	Altered ion concentration gradient between the inside and the outside of the cell reduces the amount of water molecules outside the cell, causing the accumulation of thick mucus on the epithelial surface as shown in Figure 1.

	The deficiency in CFTR protein activity in CF patients is particularly problematic in the lungs,
	where the build-up of thick mucus obstructs air flow and impairs proper immune response, which leads to chronic infection and persistent inflammation. In the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract, the build-up of mucus prevents the release of
	digestive enzymes that help the body break down food and impairs the absorption of nutrients, resulting in poor growth and development.

	CF is an autosomal, recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. A person must have a

	someone has a mutation in only one copy of the CFTR gene and the other copy is normal, he or she is a carrier but will not suffer from CF.

	Epidemiological forecasts predict that the total number of CF patients will grow significantly in the near
	term due to improvements in the standard of care, which has improved life expectancy. It is anticipated that the European CF population will grow by approximately 40% by 2025, reaching over 57,000 patients. The improvements in life expectancy in the
	United States and Canada suggest similar trends in CF population growth will likely occur in those territories.

	There is presently no cure for CF. Kalydeco and Orkambi are the only products currently approved to treat the underlying cause of
	CF. Kalydeco is a potentiator believed to increase CFTR protein activity by keeping the ion channel of the CFTR protein open for longer periods of time. However, Kalydeco is presently approved only for the treatment of CF patients with Gating
	mutations and R117H Conductance mutations, which impact less than 10% of the CF patient population in the United States and Canada. Although other potentiators may be developed, it is expected that potentiators, when used alone as a monotherapy,
	would likely address only Gating, Conductance and some Synthesis mutations, impacting only approximately 15% of all CF patients in those regions. Orkambi includes a corrector believed to improve protein folding and trafficking to enable abnormally
	folded protein to achieve some level of activity without repairing the actual protein, which works together with the same potentiator in Kalydeco, to enhance overall CFTR protein activity. However, Orkambi is only approved for the treatment of CF in
	people ages 12 and older who are homozygous for F508del, which comprises approximately 45% of the CF patient population in the United States and Europe.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The current standard of care for all other CF patients remains the management of the disease symptoms. The thick mucus that builds up in the
	lungs, the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract leads to airway obstruction and difficulty absorbing nutrients, resulting in poor growth and development. CF patients take numerous prescribed and over-the-counter medications to alleviate symptoms and
	reduce complications. Primary treatment options include inhaled therapies, which thin the mucus in the lungs, as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which improves absorption of nutrients. In addition, because thick mucus in the lungs
	impairs CF patients&#146; immune response, they also often develop chronic bacterial lung infections that require treatment with inhaled antibiotics.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Several companies are presently developing other small molecule CFTR modulators called correctors for the treatment of CF patients with

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are developing and intend to commercialize amplifiers, a new class of CFTR modulators that have pharmacological characteristics and a
	mechanism of action that is distinct from, yet synergistic with, other CFTR modulators, including correctors and potentiators. Our
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	studies demonstrate that our amplifiers selectively increase the amount of an immature form of CFTR
	protein in the cell, thereby providing additional substrate for other CFTR modulators, such as correctors and potentiators to act upon, leading to improved overall CFTR protein activity. The combined effect of amplifiers and marketed correctors and
	potentiators further increases the CFTR protein activity, which is correlated with improved clinical outcomes in CF.

	Although the mechanism of action is not fully characterized, we have confirmed that our amplifiers,
	including PTI-428 and PTI-130, do not belong to a known class of potentiators or correctors. Potentiators, such as ivacaftor, are believed to increase CFTR protein activity by keeping the ion channel of the CFTR protein open for longer periods of
	time. The distinguishing feature of potentiators is the so-called &#147;acute effect&#148; observed
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	as measured by increased CFTR protein activity immediately upon the addition of the molecule to the cells. However, our
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	studies show that acute addition of our amplifiers does not immediately affect CFTR protein activity.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Likewise, correctors, such as
	lumacaftor and VX-661, alter the ratio of mature to immature form of CFTR protein by acting on the protein folding process to increase the amount of the mature form. Our
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	studies show that our amplifiers do not affect the ratio of the
	two protein forms but rather lead to increases in the total amount of both forms of CFTR protein in a dose-dependent fashion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Accordingly, we believe that our amplifiers represent a new class of CFTR modulator distinct from correctors and potentiators. Furthermore,
	the effect on CFTR mRNA is specific. Our amplifiers do not appear to increase mRNA levels
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	for the so-called housekeeping genes that are needed for the normal functioning of the cell. In a surface and total protein expression assay,
	which measures changes in the abundance of proteins both on the plasma membrane and within the cell, our amplifiers were shown to increase the levels of CFTR, but not PgP, a closely related membrane protein.

	There is no known cure for COPD, but the symptoms are treatable and its progression can be delayed. The major goals of management are to
	reduce risk factors, manage stable COPD, prevent and treat acute exacerbations, and manage associated illnesses. The mainstays of drug therapy for symptomatic relief in stable COPD are bronchodilators. The bronchodilator agents most often used are
	&szlig;2 agonists, anticholinergics, and theophylline. Long-acting &szlig;2 agonists, or LABA, or long-acting muscarinic antagonists, or LAMA, with or without inhaled corticosteroids, or ICS, are often used in combination for those with moderate to
	severe COPD. Recently, anti-inflammatory drugs, such as PDE-4 inhibitors, have also been used for the treatment of severe COPD. Supplemental therapies, such as oxygen, pulmonary rehabilitation and physiotherapy, immunizations, nutrition and exercise

	However, no therapies definitively address mucus accumulation, which has been
	associated with lung function decline, exacerbation frequency, and early mortality. Experimental evidence also confirmed that cigarette smoking, a major risk factor for COPD, reduces CFTR activity and is causally related to reduced mucus transport
	in smokers due to inhibition of CFTR-dependent fluid transport. Accordingly, CFTR modulators have been suggested as a novel treatment strategy for the treatment of COPD given their ability to increase CFTR protein activity which could result in
	improved epithelial hydration and restoration of mucus formation to physiological levels.

	should be re-formulated for administration with devices such as inhalers and nebulizers. We believe this new formulation and different route of administration will result in lower clinically efficacious doses and lower systemic exposure that will
	avoid any toxicology issues previously observed, but additional safety and toxicology studies will need to be completed on any new formulation of PTI-130 prior to IND submission. We plan to enter into one or more research, development and

	The unfolded protein
	response, or UPR, program is focused on developing therapies that modulate the cellular processes activated when proteins do not fold properly and is directed toward developing treatments for diseases caused by defects in protein folding,
	trafficking and clearance, which include neural and retinal degenerative disorders. The ER is an organelle in the cell that is important in biosynthesis and folding of proteins. Only properly folded and functional proteins are trafficked out from
	the ER. Misfolded, poorly functional proteins remain in the ER and are targeted for clearance. When misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, the folding, trafficking and clearance capacity of the cell is increased through the activation of the UPR,
	and protein synthesis is arrested through activation of the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase, or PERK, receptor. Nonclinical studies have shown that a selective pharmacologic activation of the UPR without activating the PERK pathway has improved
	the stress response and restored cellular function, suggesting that this process can be beneficial as a potential novel disease-modifying therapy for multiple diseases with high unmet medical needs.

	We were
	founded around our unique and comprehensive expertise regarding the proteostasis network, which comprises pathways and cellular processes that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance within a cell. Many diseases appear to be
	caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, including loss-of-function diseases, such as CF, and gain-of-toxic-function diseases, such as Alzheimer&#146;s and Parkinson&#146;s diseases. The decreased ability of the proteostasis network to
	cope with misfolded proteins from inherited gene mutations, aging, and metabolic or environmental stress appears to trigger or exacerbate proteostasis diseases.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The proteostasis network is comprised of a number of integrated pathways totaling more than 1,000 proteins. A natural way to address this
	complex, interrelated network of pathways and proteins is through phenotypic screening where a desirable change in the cellular phenotype is monitored. A phenotypic screen is often viewed as more physiologically relevant and less artificial than a
	target-based screen, since it relies on cells with a native cellular environment close to the disease state, unlike other widely used approaches such as target-based assays that are based on genetically modified cells or artificial systems. For
	example, in CF screens, the change in phenotype is a functional readout for an increased ability of mutant CFTR protein to transport ions across the membranes of HBE cells from CF patients.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have developed and validated a phenotypic drug screening approach that is based on the use of highly predictive and functionally pertinent
	cellular assays. Our DRT technology platform is an integral part of our drug discovery and development approach used to discover compounds for other loss-of-function and gain-of-toxic-function diseases. We believe our DRT technology platform allows
	us to identify drug candidates with optimal pharmacological profiles to restore the proteostasis imbalance in the cell and thus address the cause of the disease. Our approach makes it also possible to identify active compounds that modulate a
	disease phenotype by acting on previously undescribed targets.

	FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. A plan for pediatric assessment also must be discussed at the end of the Phase 2 meeting. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually
	complete additional animal trials and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP
	requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate, and the manufacturer must develop methods for confirming the identity, quality, purity, and potency of the final products.
	Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability trials must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life and distribution pathway.

	New Drug Application Review and Approval Processes
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The results of drug candidate development, preclinical trials and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process,
	analytical tests conducted on the drug candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a new drug application, or NDA, requesting approval to market the drug candidate. The submission of an NDA is
	subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees; a waiver of fees may be obtained under limited circumstances.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, NDAs are subject to substantial application user fees and the
	sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. Under PDUFA, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA&#146;s fee schedule,
	effective through September&nbsp;30, 2016, the user fee for each NDA application requiring clinical data is $2,374,200. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for drugs ($114,450), and an annual establishment fee ($585,200) on facilities used to
	manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for
	products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA reviews each NDA to ensure that it
	is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it may be filed. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and
	effective for its intended use and indication for use, including use of a drug as a combination therapy, and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the drug candidate&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA
	may refer the NDA to an advisory committee consisting of a panel of external experts for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved and under what conditions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the
	facility or facilities where the active ingredient and the formulated drug candidate are manufactured and tested.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The approval process is
	lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not
	satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a Complete Response Letter if the agency decides not to
	approve the NDA in its present form. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the Complete Response Letter may include recommended
	actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases, dosages, or indications for use, which could restrict the
	commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to
	further assess a drug&#146;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

	Expedited Development and Review Programs
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA has various programs, including fast track, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, that are
	intended to increase agency interactions, expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing drug candidates, and/or provide for initial approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. We believe that PTI-428 and PTI-130 may qualify for some of these
	expedited development and review programs. Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In January 2016, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the investigation of PTI-428 for the treatment of CF. The Fast Track
	program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and
	demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to
	designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete
	application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any
	required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including
	under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide
	safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the
	evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in
	treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical
	trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of
	approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or the inability to confirm a clinical
	benefit during post-marketing trials, may allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA presently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could
	adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 also amended the FDCA to require FDA to expedite the development and review
	of a breakthrough therapy. A drug can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement
	over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, FDA shall act to
	expedite the development and review of the product&#146;s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product&#146;s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather
	nonclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient
	review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.

	Any products for which we may receive future FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things,
	record-keeping requirements, reporting and analysis of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety, efficacy and quality information, product sampling and distribution requirements, maintaining up-to-date labels,
	warnings, and contraindications, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved label; products cannot be promoted for unapproved, or
	off-label, uses, although physicians may prescribe drugs for off-label uses in accordance with the practice of medicine. Manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and
	ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to manufacturing processes often require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional
	labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent
	or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with
	the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing that may disrupt production or distribution or may

	product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters,
	holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil

	Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if issued, may
	be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term to be extended up to five years as compensation
	for patent term effectively lost due to the FDA&#146;s pre-market approval requirements. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term
	restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is
	reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for
	prior to expiration of the patent and within a 60 day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any
	patent term extension or restoration. Where a product contains multiple active ingredients, if any one active ingredient has not been previously approved, it can form the basis of an extension of patent term provided the patent claims that
	ingredient or the combination.

	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific
	scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity never previously approved by the FDA either
	alone or in combination. For a new chemical entity that was issued orphan drug designation, the FDCA provides marketing exclusivity for the &#147;same drug&#148; and &#147;same indication&#148; for a period of seven years. A drug is a new chemical
	entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the compound responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an
	abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an
	application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new
	clinical investigations, other than bioavailability trials, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an
	existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year
	exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical trials and adequate and well-controlled clinical

	In some countries, such as Germany, commercial sales of a product can begin while the reimbursement rate that a company will receive in future

	country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of drugs for human use. A member state
	may approve a specific price for the drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug on the market. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of
	discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. There can be

	U.S. federal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal healthcare programs, such

	or HHS, and various state agencies. These anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the
	referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program. Remuneration is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as cash
	payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies, or equipment. The anti-kickback laws are broad and prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare and
	biopharmaceutical industry. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

	The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented,
	a false or fraudulent claim for payment under federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless

	diabetes and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more
	&#147;concerned&#148; member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the &#147;reference&#148; member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier,
	and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of
	receiving the reference member state&#146;s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether or not to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the
	disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.

	approximately $42.7 million at an initial public offering price of $8.00 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. Based upon our current operating plan, we believe that the net proceeds we received
	from our initial public offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least March 31, 2017. However, changing circumstances beyond our
	control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate, and we may need additional funds sooner than planned. For example, our clinical trials may encounter technical, enrollment or other difficulties that could increase

	In addition to the United States and the European Union, we intend to market our
	product candidates, if approved, in other international markets. Such marketing will require separate regulatory approvals in each market and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedures vary from
	country-to-country and may require additional testing. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA or EMA approval. In addition, in many countries, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement
	before it can be approved for sale in that country. Approval by the FDA or the EMA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by

	therapy with therapies that are approved and commercially available to the patients we plan to enroll in such clinical trials. We anticipate that if our product candidate is approved for marketing, it will be approved to be administered only with
	other therapies. Our development programs and planned studies carry all the risks inherent in drug development activities, including the risk that they will fail to demonstrate meaningful efficacy or acceptable safety. In addition, our development
	programs are subject to additional regulatory, commercial, manufacturing and other risks because of the use of other therapies in combination with our product candidates. For example, the other therapies may lead to toxicities that are improperly
	attributed to our product candidates or the combination of our product candidates with other therapies may result in toxicities that the product candidate or other therapy does not produce when used alone. The other therapies we are using in
	combination may be removed from the market and thus be unavailable for testing or commercial use with any of our approved products. Testing product candidates in combination with other therapies may increase the risk of significant adverse effects
	or test failures. The timing, outcome and cost of developing products to be used in combination with other therapies is difficult to predict and dependent on a number of factors that are outside our reasonable control. If we experience safety or
	toxicity issues in our clinical trials or with any approved products, we may not receive approval to market any products, which could prevent us from ever generating revenues or achieving profitability.

	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small
	patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that fewer
	than 200,000 individuals in the United States have been diagnosed as having at the time of the submission of the request for orphan drug designation. Under Regulation No. (EC) 141/2000 on Orphan Medicinal Products, a medicinal product may be
	designated as an orphan medicinal product if, among other things, it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European
	Union when the application is made. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market
	exclusivity. This exclusivity precludes the EMA or the FDA, as applicable, from approving another marketing application for the same or, in the European Union, a similar drug for the same indication for that time period, unless, among other things,
	the later product is clinically superior. The exclusivity period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union following marketing approval. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets
	the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. We intend to seek orphan designation for PTI-428.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the United States, orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA withdraws or revokes the orphan-drug designation as permitted by law, we
	withdraw the marketing application for the drug, we consent to another&#146;s marketing application for approval of the same use or indication as the designated orphan drug, or we fail to assure a sufficient quantity of the drug as required by law.
	Similarly, in the European Union, exclusivity may be lost if we request the removal of the orphan-drug designation or the drug no longer meets any of the criteria that made it eligible for orphan-drug status at the outset. Even after an orphan drug
	is approved, the same or, in the European Union, a similar drug can subsequently be approved for the same condition if the competent regulatory agency concludes that the later drug is clinically superior to the original orphan drug by providing a
	significant therapeutic advantage over and above that drug.

	The manufacturing process for a product candidate is subject to FDA, EMA and other foreign
	regulatory authority review. Suppliers and manufacturers must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory authorities to comply with regulatory standards such as cGMP.
	In the event that any of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to comply with such requirements or to perform its obligations to us in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or
	interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we currently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with another third party, which we may not be able to do on
	reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual
	restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills or technology to another third party and a feasible alternative may not exist. These factors would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such
	manufacturer in order to have another third party manufacture our product candidates. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply
	with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget.

	not result in a definitive agreement for many reasons. For example, whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator&#146;s resources and expertise, the terms and
	conditions of the proposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator&#146;s evaluation of a number of factors, such as the design or results of our clinical trials, the potential market for our product candidates, the costs and complexities of
	manufacturing and delivering our product candidates to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to ownership or the coverage of our intellectual property, and industry and market conditions generally.
	If we determine that additional collaborations for our product candidates are necessary and are unable to enter into such collaborations on acceptable terms, we might elect to delay or scale back the development or commercialization of our product

	possible that we may initiate a clinical trial or trials for PTI-428 only to find that data from competing products make it impossible for us to complete enrollment in these trials, resulting in our inability to file for marketing approval with

	Although PTI-428 is being developed as a combination therapy to be administered with ivacaftor and lumacaftor, Vertex or other competitors

	Market acceptance and sales of PTI-428, or any other product candidates that we
	develop, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities
	and third-party payors, such as private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit management organizations, decide which medications they will pay for, at what tier level and establish reimbursement levels. A primary
	trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and these third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications.
	Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any
	product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining reimbursement for our
	products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with products administered under the supervision of a physician. Also, reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If
	reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize PTI-428, or any other product candidates that we develop. We will also be required to establish systems and programs that assist
	patients in determining the reimbursement level and in some instances establishing patient economic support programs to alleviate the economic burden of co-pays and/or co-insurance. These patient support programs are complex, costly and require
	knowledge and expertise that we currently do not possess.

	approval of additional generic drug treatments. We expect to experience pricing pressures

	In addition, there may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for approved products, and

	rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Payment rates may vary
	according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for

	Further, the recently enacted ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the
	federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity can now be found guilty of fraud or false claims under ACA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, ACA provides that the
	government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Possible sanctions for violation of
	these anti-kickback laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions. Any violations of these laws, or

	In addition, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state
	legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription drugs and biologics and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While we cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may result in
	decreased reimbursement for drugs and biologics, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. This could harm our ability to generate revenues. Increases in importation or re-importation of pharmaceutical

	It is difficult and expensive to protect our intellectual property rights and we cannot ensure that they will prevent third parties from competing
	against us. If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology, or obtain and maintain issued patents that are sufficient to protect our product candidates, others could compete against us more directly, which would have a material
	adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our success will depend, in part, on our
	ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights, both in the United States and other countries, successfully defend this intellectual property against third-party challenges and successfully enforce this intellectual property to prevent
	third-party infringement. We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements.

	Our ability to
	protect any of our product candidates and technologies from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents in both the United States and other
	countries. Patent matters in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Changes in the patent laws, their implementing regulations or their interpretations may diminish
	the value of our patent rights.

	There can be no assurance that we will discover or develop patentable products or processes or that
	patents will issue from any pending patent applications owned or licensed by us, or if issued, the breadth of such patent coverage. We currently have no issued patents covering any of our product candidates, including PTI-428 and PTI-130, or our
	technologies, and our patent applications related to our CF program are in the earliest stages, primarily provisional patent applications. We cannot provide any assurances that any of our pending patent applications will lead to issued patents and,
	if they do, that such patents will include claims with a scope sufficient to protect our product candidates or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. Even if issued, we cannot guarantee that claims of issued patents owned or licensed to us are
	or will be held valid or enforceable by the courts or, even if unchallenged, will provide us with exclusivity or commercial value for our product candidates or technology or any significant protection against competitive products or prevent others
	from designing around our claims. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection could be reduced. Our patent rights also depend on our
	compliance with technology and patent licenses upon which our patent rights are based and upon the validity of assignments of patent rights from consultants and other inventors that were, or are, not employed by us.

	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual
	questions, and, therefore, the issuance, scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented. U.S.
	patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings,
<I>
	ex parte
</I>
	reexamination, or
<I>
	inter partes
</I>
	review proceedings, supplemental examination and challenges in district court. Patents may be subjected to
	opposition, post-grant review, or comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign, both national and regional, patent offices. These proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in
	the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents, should they issue, that we may own or exclusively license may not provide any protection against competitors.

	In addition, even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge any such patent we own or license through adversarial

	Our success also will depend, in part, on our refraining from infringing patents or otherwise violating intellectual property owned or
	controlled by others. Numerous patents and pending applications are owned by third parties in the fields in which we are developing product candidates, both in the United States and elsewhere. It is difficult for industry participants, including us,
	to identify all third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our product candidates and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the
	meaning of patent claims. Moreover, because some patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the patents publish, we cannot be certain that third parties have not filed patent applications that cover our products and technologies. We may
	fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance to our technology. In
	addition, we may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale, importation or use of a current or future product candidate, or we may incorrectly conclude that a third-party patent is invalid,
	unenforceable or not infringed by our activities. Additionally, pending patent applications can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our future products or the manufacture or use of our
	future products. Pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities, research institutions and others may have filed patent applications or have received, or may obtain, issued patents in the United States or elsewhere relating to
	aspects of our technology, including our products, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patents will require us to alter our product candidates or

	not obtained, we might be prevented from pursuing the development and commercialization of certain of our potential products entirely or for certain indications. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive,
	which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our products on favorable terms may have a material

	If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates or our technology,
	the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States and in most European countries, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a
	validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with
	prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With
	respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or
	unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our
	business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.

	Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business and the unique properties of our technology, our success is highly dependent upon

	and sales, which may strain our existing managerial, operational, regulatory compliance, financial and other resources. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist in formulating our research and development strategy and adhering to complex
	regulatory requirements. We face competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such
	individuals on acceptable terms, if at all. Additionally, our facilities are located in Massachusetts, which may make attracting and retaining qualified scientific and technical personnel from outside of Massachusetts difficult. The failure to

	The stock markets

	realization of any of the risks described in this &#147;Risk Factors&#148; section of this report, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company

	In addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume

	As a public reporting company, we are and will be subject to rules and regulations established from time to

	Upon completion of our initial public offering in February 2016, we became a public reporting company subject to the rules and
	regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the PCAOB. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting.
	Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to
	Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting by the time our annual report for the year ending
	December&nbsp;31, 2016 is due and thereafter, which will require us to document and make significant changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide
	an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at such time as we cease to be an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; as defined in the JOBS Act, although, as described in the preceding risk factor, we
	could potentially qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; for more than five years. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which
	our controls are documented, designed or operating.

	If our senior management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal
	control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on management&#146;s assessment and the effectiveness of our internal
	control over financial reporting once we cease to be an emerging growth company, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have a
	material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our
	financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

	Upon completion of our initial public offering, we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure
	controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and
	reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
	not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system,
	misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

	As a public company, we are incurring and will incur
	significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Dodd-Frank Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market, have required changes
	in corporate governance practices of public companies. In addition, rules that the SEC is implementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to require additional changes. We expect that compliance with these and
	other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, will substantially increase our expenses, including our legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and
	costly. We also expect these laws, rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to
	obtain the same or similar coverage, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as officers. We expect that we will need to hire additional accounting, finance and other
	personnel in connection with our efforts to comply with the requirements of being a public company, and our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. These
	requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Although the JOBS Act may for a limited period of time somewhat lessen the cost of complying with these additional
	regulatory and other requirements, we nonetheless expect a substantial increase in legal, accounting, insurance and certain other expenses in the future, which will negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

	February&nbsp;11, 2016, our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol &#147;PTI&#148;. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock. As a result we have not set forth quarterly information with
	respect to the high and low prices for our common stock for the two most recent fiscal years or provided a performance graph. Shares sold in our initial public offering on February&nbsp;11, 2016 were priced at $8.00 per share. On March 29, 2016, the
	last reported sale price for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market was $9.10 per share.

	On February&nbsp;17, 2016, we closed the sale of 6,250,000 shares of common stock to the public at an initial public offering price of
	$8.00 per share. The offer and sale of the shares in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-208735), which was filed with the SEC on December&nbsp;23, 2015 and amended
	subsequently and declared effective on February&nbsp;10, 2016. The underwriters of the offering were Leerink Partners and RBC Capital Markets, acting as joint book-running managers for the offering and as representatives of the underwriters. Baird
	and H.C. Wainwright&nbsp;&amp; Co. acted as co-managers for the offering. We raised approximately $42.7 million in net proceeds in the IPO after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $3.5 million and other offering
	expenses of $3.8 million. No offering expenses were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates) or persons owning ten percent or more of any class of our equity securities or to any other affiliates. There
	has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act.

	Overview

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are an innovative
	biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that treat diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, a set of pathways that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and
	clearance. Leveraging our unique and comprehensive expertise of the proteostasis network, we have developed the Disease Relevant Translation, or DRT, technology platform, a validated drug screening approach for identifying highly translatable
	therapeutics based on predictive and functionally pertinent phenotypic assays and disease relevant models. Using this proprietary platform, we identified a new class of small molecules, which we call amplifiers, that modulate proteins in the
	proteostasis network. Our initial therapeutic focus is on cystic fibrosis, or CF, which is caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, protein and insufficient CFTR protein function. We are initially
	developing and intend to commercialize our lead amplifier of CFTR protein, PTI-428, to improve CFTR protein function.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead product
	candidate PTI-428 is an orally bioavailable CFTR modulator belonging to the amplifier class. CFTR modulators are compounds that affect the folding, trafficking and clearance of CFTR protein and can be classified according to the ways in which they
	affect CFTR protein. Amplifiers, which include PTI-428, are CFTR modulators that selectively increase the amount of an immature form of CFTR protein to provide additional substrate for other CFTR modulators, such as certain correctors and
	potentiators, to act upon. Using industry- standard
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	studies, we have confirmed that co-administration of PTI-428 with other CFTR modulators significantly improves the
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	CFTR protein activity achieved by those CFTR
	modulators alone.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In December 2015, the investigational new drug application, or IND, that we submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug
	Administration, or FDA, for a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate our PTI-428 product candidate became effective. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first quarter of 2016, expect to have preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics and
	pharmacodynamics data from the Phase 1 clinical trial available in the first half of 2016 and aim to complete the Phase 1 clinical trial with the final report by the end of 2016. If our Phase 1 clinical trial results are favorable, we plan to
	initiate our Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2016 with proof of concept data expected to be available in the first half of 2017.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are leveraging our DRT technology platform to design and develop our own correctors and potentiators that are optimized to work more
	synergistically with our amplifiers than third-party CFTR modulators. There is significant potential for improvement in clinical outcomes beyond existing treatments and therapies presently in

	our amplifiers.

	In addition to PTI-428 and our other proprietary drug candidates for the treatment of CF, which we refer to as our CF
	program, our product pipeline includes our product candidate PTI-130 for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, our product candidate PTI-NC-733, a novel combination of our proprietary CFTR modulators, and two programs that
	we have partnered with major pharmaceutical companies for indications with large patient populations. The Usp14 program with Biogen New Ventures Inc. (formerly Biogen Idec New Ventures Inc.), or Biogen, is intended to enhance the clearance of
	misfolded aggregation-prone proteins in neurodegenerative diseases, such as in Alzheimer&#146;s and Parkinson&#146;s disease. We have announced the achievement of our initial preclinical milestone in July 2014, and we continue to make progress in
	seeking orally available, potent, selective and brain-penetrant inhibitors of Usp14 as candidates for evaluation in the IND- enabling safety assessment studies required for transition to the clinic. The unfolded protein response, or UPR, program
	with Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, is intended to reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is observed in many diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network and characterized by defects in
	protein folding, trafficking and clearance, including genetic, neurodegenerative and retinal degenerative diseases. We are presently using our DRT technology platform to identify selective UPR activators and plan to initiate preclinical development
	in 2017.

	product sales. We have funded our operations to date with proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, the issuance of convertible promissory notes and, to a lesser extent, payments received in connection with collaboration agreements and a research

	We evaluate multiple-element arrangements based
	on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition&#151;Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (1)&nbsp;the deliverables included in the
	arrangement and (2)&nbsp;whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. When deliverables are separable, consideration received is allocated to the
	separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit. When we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we
	must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. This evaluation requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the
	other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of return with
	respect to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research, development,
	manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use any other deliverable for
	its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverable, whether the

	The consideration received under the arrangement that is fixed or determinable is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based
	on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting within each arrangement following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, we determine the estimated
	selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling
	price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price as we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires
	significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and
	estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of
	accounting.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in
	ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, we recognize revenue from the combined unit of accounting over the contractual or estimated performance
	period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of the our research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist, then we recognize revenue
	under the arrangement on a straight- line basis over the period we are expected to complete its performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively
	measurable performance measures exist, then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of
	revenue earned, as determined using the straight-line method or proportional performance method, as applicable, as of the period ending date. At the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is
	substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the
	enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable
	relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone and the level of
	effort and investment required to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is
	substantive. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 605-28, Revenue Recognition&#151;Milestone Method, or ASC 605-28, revenue from milestone payments will be recognized in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of any substantive
	milestones, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive are recognized as earned if there are no remaining performance obligations or over the remaining period of performance, with a
	cumulative catch-up being for the elapsed portion of the research term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

	February&nbsp;11, 2016, we were a private company and we lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Accordingly, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies
	and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. The expected term of our options has been determined utilizing the &#147;simplified&#148; method for awards that
	qualify as &#147;plain-vanilla&#148; options, while the expected term of our options granted to consultants and nonemployees has been determined based on the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to
	the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect
	to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

	the conversion of the warrant to a common stock warrant, which occurred upon the completion of our IPO on February&nbsp;11, 2016. Subsequent to such conversion, the warrant is classified as a component of stockholders&#146; equity and is no longer

	We use the Monte-Carlo simulation analysis, which incorporates assumptions and estimates to value the derivative instrument. We assess these
	assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions is obtained. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement include the fair value of our common stock, expected term of the
	derivative instrument, expected volatility of the common stock price, risk-free interest rate, expected sales-based milestone payments, discount rate, probability of a change of control event, and the probability that the counterparty would elect to
	accept the alternative cash payment in lieu of its right to the future sales-based milestone payments. We determine the per share fair value of the underlying stock price by taking into consideration recent factors we deem relevant. We estimate the
	expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a one-year term. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for a one-year term. We estimate the expected
	sales-based milestone payments based on four times the maximum research funding allowable under the CFFT collaboration agreement plus the expected achievement of certain milestones. We estimate the discount rate in the calculation of the present
	value of the expected future milestone payments based on expected returns of alternative investments of a similar type. We estimate the probability of a change of control event by taking into consideration recent developments.

	also due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $0.1 million. This increase in personnel-related costs resulted from additional salary costs of $0.2 million due to an average increase in the headcount of research and development employees from
	year to year, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $ 0.1 million. Further, facility-related and other general research and development expenses for activities not directly associated with our principal research and
	development programs increased $1.0 million as a result of a $0.5 million increase in the cost of services provided by CROs, an increase of $0.3 million in spending on general lab supplies due to increased activity in our laboratory, and an increase
	of $0.2 million in occupancy and other facility related costs.

	Research and development expenses were $16.7 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, compared to
	$13.0 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase of $3.8 million was primarily due to an increase of $2.7 million in the costs incurred on our CF program. This increase resulted from development work performed in connection with
	the amendment to our collaboration agreement with CFFT in February 2014. Additionally, there was an increase of $0.9 million in the costs incurred on the Usp14 program, a collaboration with Biogen, as the agreement underlying the program was in
	effect for the full year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 compared to less than one month during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The overall increase in research and development expenses was also due to an increase of $0.8 million in
	personnel-related costs due to the increase in headcount of research and development employees to 37 employees as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 from 33 employees as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, and costs of $0.4 million incurred related to the UPR
	program. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in costs associated with a program that was not continued in 2014, a decrease of $0.2 million in scientific advisory board costs as the size of the board was reduced and
	the contracts were renegotiated for lower rates during 2014, and a $0.3 million decrease in depreciation expense as many assets became fully depreciated during 2014.

	Operating Activities
</I>
	. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, operating activities used $19.4
	million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $25.0 million, partially offset by cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $4.3 million and non-cash charges of $1.2 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed
	to research and development activities and our general and administrative expenses, as we had limited collaboration and research grant revenue for the year. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 consisted primarily of a $2.7 million increase in deferred revenue related to our collaboration agreements, a $0.5 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $0.4 million increase in accounts payable, a $0.4 million increase
	in accrued expenses, a $0.2 million decrease in other assets and a $0.1 million decrease in other current assets. The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were due to increased spending on our research and development programs as well
	as the timing of vendor invoicing and payments and the decrease in accounts receivable was due to the timing of payments received under our collaboration agreements.

	In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of convertible preferred stock
	and stockholders&#146; deficit and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
	three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is
	to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
	statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was
	incorporated in Delaware on December&nbsp;13, 2006. The Company is an innovative biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that treat diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, a set
	of pathways that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance. The Company&#146;s initial therapeutic focus is on cystic fibrosis, which is caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
	(&#147;CFTR&#148;) protein and insufficient CFTR protein function. The Company&#146;s lead product candidate, PTI-428, is in early clinical development, and the Company&#146;s other drug candidates are in the discovery phase.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited
	to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Product
	candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant
	amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the Company&#146;s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize
	significant revenue from product sales.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of
	operations, realization of assets, and the satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has primarily funded its operations with proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock
	and, to a lesser extent, payments received in connection with a collaboration agreement and research grants. The Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations and had an accumulated deficit of $120.2 million as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. The Company expects to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future. As of March&nbsp;30, 2016, the Company expects that its cash of $13.8 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, together with net proceeds of $42.7
	million received from its initial public offering (see below), will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least March&nbsp;31, 2017. The future viability of the Company beyond that point is
	dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to finance its operations. Although the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms
	acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could
	adversely affect its business prospects.

	Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or

	in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset group for recoverability, the
	Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset group to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows

<I>
	Revenue Recognition&#151;Multiple-Element Arrangements (&#147;ASC 605-25&#148;)
</I>
	. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC 605-25, the Company evaluates multiple-element arrangements to determine (1)&nbsp;the deliverables included in the
	arrangement and (2)&nbsp;whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. When deliverables are separable, consideration received is allocated to the
	separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit. When the Company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of
	accounting, the Company must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. This evaluation requires the Company to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such
	deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement
	includes a general right of return with respect to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company&#146;s control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, the
	Company considers factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, the Company
	considers whether the collaboration partner can use any other deliverable for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverable, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item, and whether there are
	other vendors that can provide the undelivered items.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The consideration received under the arrangement that is fixed or determinable is
	then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting. The Company determines the selling price of a unit of accounting within each arrangement following the hierarchy of
	evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, the Company determines the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;), if available; third-party evidence
	(&#147;TPE&#148;) of selling price if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling price (&#147;BESP&#148;), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company typically uses BESP to estimate the selling price as it generally does not have VSOE
	or TPE of selling price for its units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, the Company considers applicable market conditions and relevant
	entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. The Company validates the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to
	determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.

	The Company recognizes arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of
	the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. In the event that a deliverable does not represent a separate unit of accounting, the Company recognizes revenue from the combined unit of accounting
	over the contractual or estimated performance period for the undelivered items, which is typically the term of the Company&#146;s research and development obligations. If there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable
	performance measures do not exist, then the Company recognizes revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. Conversely, if the pattern of performance over
	which the service is provided to the customer can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist, then the Company recognizes revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method. Revenue recognized is limited
	to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the straight-line method or proportional performance method, as applicable, as of the period ending date. At the inception of
	an arrangement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether:
	(1)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either the Company&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the Company&#146;s performance to
	achieve the milestone, (2)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. The Company evaluates factors such as
	the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is
	considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive. The Company will recognize revenue in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of any
	substantive milestones, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Milestones that are not considered substantive are recognized as earned if there are no remaining performance obligations or over the remaining period of performance,
	with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

	The Company has entered into various research and development contracts with research institutions and other companies both inside and outside
	of the United States. These agreements are generally cancelable, and related payments are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing research costs. When evaluating the adequacy of
	the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end
	of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company&#146;s estimates. The Company&#146;s historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the actual costs.

	The Company classifies a warrant to purchase shares of its Series A preferred stock as a liability on its balance sheets as this warrant is a
	free-standing financial instrument that may require the Company to transfer assets upon exercise. The warrant was initially recorded at fair value on date of grant, and it is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date. Changes
	in fair value of the warrant are recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Following the reverse stock split of the common stock of the Company and the completion of the
	Company&#146;s IPO in February 2016, the warrant became a warrant to purchase 14,800 shares of common stock. At that time, the warrant was reclassified to a component of stockholder&#146;s equity and is no longer subject to remeasurement.

	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates assumptions and estimates, to value the preferred stock warrant.
	The Company has assessed these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions is obtained. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement include the fair value per share of the
	underlying Series A preferred stock, the remaining contractual term of the warrant, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and expected volatility of the price of the underlying preferred stock. The Company determines the fair value per
	share of the underlying preferred stock by taking into consideration the most recent sales of its convertible preferred stock, results obtained from third-party valuations and additional factors that are deemed relevant. The Company historically has
	been a private company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information of its stock. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a term equal
	to the remaining contractual term of the warrant. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrant. Expected dividend yield
	is determined considering that the underlying Series A preferred stock is entitled to dividends of 8.0%&nbsp;per year, whether or not declared.

	Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per
	share is computed using the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and, if dilutive, the weighted average number of potential shares of common stock, including the assumed exercise of stock options and
	unvested restricted stock. Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines net loss per share for the holders of the Company&#146;s common
	shares and participating securities. The Company&#146;s convertible preferred stock contains participation rights in any dividend paid by the Company and are deemed to be participating securities. Net loss attributable to common stockholders and
	participating preferred shares are allocated to each share on an as-converted basis as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. The participating securities do not include a contractual obligation to share in losses of the Company

	interests. The weighted average number of common shares included in the computation of diluted net loss gives effect to all potentially dilutive common equivalent shares, including outstanding stock options, warrants, preferred stock and the
	potential issuance of stock upon the conversion of the Company&#146;s convertible notes. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share if their effect is antidilutive.

	(&#147;ASU 2014-09&#148;), which

	the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard defines a five-step process to achieve this principle, and will require companies to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance.
	The Company expects that these judgments and estimates will include identifying performance obligations in the customer contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction
	price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,

	The fair value of the derivative liability (see Note 11) is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represents a Level
	3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the derivative instrument was determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation analysis. In determining the fair value of the derivative liability, the inputs impacting fair value include
	the fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock, expected term of the derivative instrument, expected volatility of the common stock price, risk-free interest rate, expected sales-based milestone payments, discount rate, probability of a change of
	control event, and the probability that the counterparty would elect to accept the alternative cash payment in lieu of its right to the future sales-based milestone payments.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company determined the per share fair value of the underlying stock price by taking into
	consideration recent business development and economic factors it deemed relevant. The Company determined the expected term of the instrument to be 0.12 years and 1.0 year for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
	Company estimated its expected stock volatility to be 74.1% and 78.1% for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 respectively, based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for terms matching the expected term of the
	instrument for each respective period. The risk-free interest rate was determined to be 0.14% and 0.25% for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for terms matching the expected
	term of the instrument for each respective period. The Company estimated the expected sales-based milestone payments based on four times the maximum research funding allowable under the CFFT collaboration agreement (see Note 11) plus the expected
	achievement of certain milestones, which totaled $28,520 for each the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. The Company estimated the discount rate in the calculation of the present value of the expected future milestone payments to be 25%
	and 30% for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, based on expected returns of alternative investments of a similar type. The Company estimated the probability of a change of control event to be 10% and 50% for the years
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, by taking into consideration recent developments within the Company.

	August&nbsp;31, 2015, at which time such cumulative accruing dividends totaled $36,016, and (2)&nbsp;the right of holders of Series A preferred stock to receive a cash payment of accruing dividends upon the automatic conversion of the Series A
	preferred stock into common stock was modified such that all previously accrued but unpaid dividends on Series A preferred stock will be paid in shares of common stock, at a price of $13.9019172 per share, upon such conversion of the Series A
	preferred stock. If as of January&nbsp;1, 2016, the Series A preferred stock has not automatically converted into shares of common stock according to its terms, the holders of the Series A preferred stock will be entitled to receive dividends at the
	rate of 8.0%&nbsp;per year of the respective Original Issue Price per share, commencing as of the respective original issuance date of the Series A preferred stock. These amendments to the Series A preferred stock dividend rights were accounted for
	as a modification of preferred stock based on a quantitative assessment of the change in the fair value that resulted from the modification of the dividend rights on the modification date. The decrease in the fair value of Series A preferred stock
	measured immediately before the modification and immediately after the modification, equal to $173, was recorded as a deemed dividend from holders of preferred stock to the holders of common stock, resulting in an increase to additional paid-in
	capital of $173 and a corresponding decrease of $173 to the carrying value of the Series A preferred stock.

	On December&nbsp;17, 2015, the right of holders of Series A and Series B preferred stock to
	become entitled to accruing dividends was further modified such that if, as of April&nbsp;1, 2016, the Series A and Series B preferred stock has not automatically converted into shares of common stock according to its terms, the holders of the
	Series A and Series B preferred stock will be entitled to receive dividends at the rate of 8.0%&nbsp;per year of the respective Original Issue Price per share, commencing as of the respective original issuance date of the Series A and Series B
	preferred stock. The decrease in the fair value of Series A preferred stock measured immediately before the modification and immediately after the modification, equal to $743, was recorded as a deemed dividend from holders of preferred stock to the
	holders of common stock resulting in an increase to additional paid-in capital of $743 and a corresponding decrease of $743 to the carrying value of the Series A preferred stock. The increase in the fair value of Series B preferred stock measured
	immediately before the modification and immediately after the modification, equal to $26, was recorded as a deemed dividend from holders of common stock to holders of preferred stock the resulting in an decrease to additional paid-in capital of $26
	and a corresponding increase of $26 to the carrying value of the Series B preferred stock. In connection with the completion of the Company&#146;s IPO in February 2016, all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock were converted to common

	Under terms of the Astellas Agreement, Astellas purchased from the Company convertible promissory notes totaling $5,000 with terms consistent
	with those of other investors that purchased convertible promissory notes issued during 2014 (see Note 6). In addition, the Company will be eligible to receive research funding support, based on the establishment of an annual research budget, and
	future research, development and sales milestone payments of up to $398,450, as well as tiered royalty payments ranging in the mid single-digit to low double- digit percentages of net sales, as defined in the agreement. Under the agreement, the
	companies will conduct research during the initial research term, which is three and a half years, to identify lead compounds for clinical development. Astellas will reimburse the Company at a specified rate for time incurred as well as 100% of any
	third-party costs incurred by the Company. Research funding to the Company for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 first year of the research term was approximately $6,030, exclusive of reimbursement of third-party costs. In addition, Astellas had
	the right to specify two additional projects to be conducted under the same terms, which, if it fully exercised this right, would bring the total potential payments under the collaboration to $1,200,000. This right had not been exercised by Astellas
	as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 or 2014 and was initially set to lapse on May&nbsp;4, 2015. Astellas has requested, and the Company has agreed, to extend the exercise period for this right through November&nbsp;4, 2016. Astellas will develop and have
	full control over, at its sole cost and expense, the commercialization of each licensed product unless the Company exercises its option to opt in for global co-development and U.S. co-commercialization rights. These options to co-develop and/or co-
	commercialize are at the Company&#146;s sole discretion. If the options are not exercised, the Company will not have any continuing performance obligations.

	The Company determined that the deliverables under the agreement include (i)&nbsp;the research license, (ii)&nbsp;the research services to be

	agreement. The Company concluded that the research license and the involvement in the Committee did not have standalone value to Astellas and, therefore, are not separable from the research services. Therefore, the research license, research
	services and participation in the Committee have been combined and accounted for as a single unit of accounting. Accordingly, the research funding support payments and any reimbursement of third-party costs are being recognized by the Company as
	revenue over the three and a half year research term of the agreement, which commenced in January 2015, with a cumulative catch-up for the elapsed portion of the research term being recognized at the time any such payments are earned. None of the

	Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. (&#147;CFFT&#148;). Under terms of the CFFT Agreement, which was subsequently amended in May 2013 and January 2014, CFFT agreed to provide up to $5,704 (the &#147;Award&#146;) in research funding to the Company
	over two non-consecutive one-year periods from March 2012 to March 2013 and from January 2014 to December 2014. Revenue recognized under the CFFT Agreement totaled $0, $2,561 and $691, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,

	Under the CFFT agreement, the Company has agreed to make future sales-based milestone payments (which the agreement refers to as royalties) to
	CFFT of up to $34,224 upon achieving specified commercialization milestones with respect to the first of any product developed utilizing any compound covered under the collaboration agreement. The Company has also agreed to pay to CFFT royalties of
	a mid single-digit percentage, up to an aggregate of $22,816, on any amounts received by the Company from the sale, license or transfer to a third party of rights in the technology developed as a result of this collaboration. Any such royalty
	payments shall be credited against the first three sales-based milestone payments owed by the Company through the second anniversary of the first commercial sale of a product developed as a result of this collaboration. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015
	and 2014, the Company had not developed a commercial product in connection with this collaboration, and it had not sold, licensed or transferred rights in the technology resulting from this collaboration.

	In lieu of the milestone and royalty payments described above, in the event of a change of
	control of the Company, CFFT may elect to accept a one-time payment equal to the consideration CFFT would have received if it had owned (a)&nbsp;268,265 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock if the change of control occurs prior to the selection
	by the Company of a compound intended for product approval, or (b)&nbsp;444,025 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock if the change of control occurs after the selection by the Company of a compound intended for product approval. This
	alternative payment option upon a change of control would be cash settled in the event of a change of control and meets the definition of an embedded derivative. The Company estimated the fair value of this liability and concluded that the liability
	was immaterial as of the inception date of the CFFT Agreement. The Company estimated the fair value of this derivative liability to be $2 and $65 as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 3). In conjunction with the January 2014
	amendment to the CFFT Agreement, the number of shares underlying the alternative payment option was amended to increase the number of shares used in the calculation resulting in an increase of $113 to the fair value of the instrument. The increase
	in the derivative liability was allocated to the consideration received for research funding under the CFFT Agreement and reduced the amount of revenue that will be recognized over the research funding term by a corresponding amount.

	uncured material breach of any material covenants or obligations or if any representation or warranty is materially untrue as of the date made and uncured after 30 days from notice. CFFT may also terminate if a case or proceeding under the
	bankruptcy laws is filed against the Company and not dismissed within 60 days, or if the Company files for insolvency, reorganization, receivership, dissolution or liquidation.

	Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be
	subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of net
	operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. The Company has not currently completed an evaluation of ownership changes through
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 to assess whether utilization of the Company&#146;s net operating loss or research and development credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382. To the extent an ownership change occurs
	in the future, the net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation. Further, until a study is completed and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.

	This study may result in an increase or decrease to the Company&#146;s credit carryforwards; however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position. A full valuation allowance has

	The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing
	upon its ability to realize the deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards. Management has considered the Company&#146;s history of cumulative net losses
	incurred since inception and its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales since inception and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the
	deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at each reporting period.

	In addition to the potentially dilutive securities noted above, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had
	outstanding convertible promissory notes for which principal and unpaid accrued interest due under the notes was automatically convertible into the class of the Company&#146;s stock issued in the Company&#146;s next qualified financing, as defined,
	based on a conversion price equal to the price per share paid by the investors in the financing (see Note 6). Because the necessary conditions for conversion of the notes had not been met as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company excluded these
