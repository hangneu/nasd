	provisions of Canadian securities laws (collectively, &#147;forward-looking
	statements&#148;) concerning the anticipated production and developments in our
	operations in future periods, our planned exploration, development and mining
	activities, the adequacy of our financial resources and other events or
	conditions that may occur in the future. These statements relate to analyses and
	other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of
	amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Statements concerning mineral reserve and resource estimates
	may also be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements to the extent that
	they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered if and

	discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans,
	projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but
	not always, using words or phrases such as &#147;expects&#148;, &#147;anticipates&#148;, &#147;plans&#148;,

	The Company uses the non-GAAP measures of direct mining cost,
	total cash cost and total production cost per ounce of silver to manage and
	evaluate operating performance. The Company believes that, in addition to
	conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors use
	this information to evaluate the Company&#146;s performance and ability to generate
	cash flows. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and
	should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
	performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This classification is based upon The Silver Institute&#146;s
	production cost standard as endorsed on June 16, 2011. Previous to this date
	there was no standardized presentation guidance and the Company reported cash
	production cost, cash operating cost and total production cost. The Company
	moved to The Silver Institute&#146;s production cost standard in its disclosures in
	2011 in order to facilitate more uniform disclosures within the industry. All
	comparatives have been updated to reflect the current presentation standard.

	In this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar

	references to &#147;$&#148; refer to U.S. Dollars, all references to &#147;C$&#148; refer to

	Table No. 2 below sets out the rate of exchange for the
	Canadian dollar at December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009,
	December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the average rates for each period, and
	the range of high and low rates for each period. Table No. 3 sets out the high
	and low rates of exchange for the Canadian dollar for each month during the
	previous six months.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For purposes of these tables, the rate of exchange means the
	Bank of Canada&#146;s nominal noon exchange rate. The tables set out the number of
	Canadian dollars required under that formula to buy one U.S. dollar. The average
	rate in Table No. 2 means the average of the exchange rates on the last day of
	each month during the period.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We have prepared estimates of future production, operating

	which are not within our control. These factors include, but are not limited to,
	actual ore mined varying from estimates of grade, tonnage, dilution, and
	metallurgical and other characteristics; short-term operating factors such as
	the need for sequential development of ore bodies and the processing of new or
	different ore grades from those planned; mine failures, slope failures or
	equipment failures; industrial accidents; natural phenomena such as inclement
	weather conditions, floods, droughts, rock slides and earthquakes; encountering
	unusual or unexpected geological conditions; changes in power costs and
	potential power shortages; exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations;
	shortages of principal supplies needed for operations, including explosives,
	fuels, chemical reagents, water, equipment parts and lubricants; labor shortages
	or strikes; high rates of inflation; civil disobedience and protests; and
	restrictions (including change to the taxation regime) or regulations (including import restriction

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Pirquitas Mine is currently our only mineral property in

	the risks associated with establishing new mining operations including:
</P>
<UL STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN: JUSTIFY">

	the availability and cost of skilled labor and mining equipment;
<LI>
	the availability and cost of appropriate smelting and refining

</LI>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The costs, timing and complexities of operating the Pirquitas
	Mine and constructing and developing our other projects may be greater than we
	anticipate because the majority of our property interests are not located in
	developed areas, and, as a result, our property interests may not be served by
	appropriate road access, water and power supply and other support
	infrastructure. Cost estimates may increase as more detailed engineering work is
	completed on a project. It is common in new mining operations to experience
	unexpected costs, problems and delays during construction, development and mine
	start-up. In addition, delays in the early stages of mineral production often
	occur. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that our activities will result

	Pirquitas Mine, which achieved commercial production on December 1, 2009, all of
	our properties are in the exploration or development stage. With the exception
	of our Pitarrilla and San Luis Projects we have not defined or delineated any
	proven or probable reserves on any of our exploration stage properties. Mineral
	exploration involves significant risk because few properties that are explored
	contain bodies of ore that become commercially economic to develop into
	producing mines. If our current exploration programs do not result in the

	The unprecedented events in global financial markets in the

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our resource estimates are not directly comparable to those

	requirements, as we report resources in accordance with Canadian practices.
	These practices are different from the practices used to report resource
	estimates in reports and other materials filed by U.S. domestic companies with
	the SEC in that the Canadian practice is to report measured, indicated and
	inferred resources. In the United States, mineralization may not be classified
	as a &#147;reserve&#148; unless the determination has been made that the mineralization
	could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve
	determination is made. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or
	any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into
	reserves. Further, &#147;Inferred Mineral Resources&#148; have a great amount of
	uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or
	economically. Disclosure of &#147;contained ounces&#148; is permitted disclosure under

	maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as such
	standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, and we may
	not be able to ensure that we can conclude, on an ongoing basis, that we have
	effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section
	404 of SOX. Our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of SOX on an
	ongoing, timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the
	reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business
	and negatively impact the trading price or the market value of our securities.
	In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or
	difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating
	results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Future
	acquisitions of companies, if any, may provide us with challenges in
	implementing the required processes, procedures and controls in our acquired
	operations. No evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal
	control over financial reporting will detect or uncover all failures of persons
	within our Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be
	reported. The effectiveness of our processes, procedures and controls could also
	be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. In addition, as we continue to
	expand, the challenges involved in implementing appropriate internal control
	over financial reporting will increase and will require that we continue to
	monitor our internal control over financial reporting. Although we intend to
	expend substantial time and incur substantial costs, as necessary, to ensure
	ongoing compliance, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in complying
	with Section 404 of SOX.

	We are a silver resource and producing company that has one

	projects also contain significant gold resources. Our properties are located in
	Argentina, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru and the United States. We continue to
	explore for, and acquire, if warranted, silver properties throughout the world.
	We are also focused on operating and producing silver from our Pirquitas Mine,
	and on advancing our other mineral projects and project pipeline. A commercially
	viable mineral deposit may not exist on any of our exploration stage properties,
	and further exploration work may be required before a final evaluation as to the
	economic and legal feasibility of any property is determined. See Item 3.D &#150;

	In addition to the Pirquitas Mine located in the Province of

	the more advanced San Luis Project in Ancash Department, Peru; the Pitarrilla
	and San Agustin Projects in Durango State, Mexico; and the Diablillos Project in
	Salta Province, Argentina. We also control a large portfolio of mineral
	properties, with a number of these properties having silver mineral resources
	identified on them, including the Berenguela Project in Peru; the Nazas Project
	in Durango State, Mexico; the Challacollo Project in Chile; the San Agustin and
	Veta Colorada Projects in Mexico; the Candelaria and Maverick Springs Projects
	in Nevada, U.S.A.; and the Sunrise Lake Project in the Northwest Territories of

	Mexico, is currently optioned to a third party (as set out in this Item 4.B -
	&#147;Business Overview - Mineral Properties&#148;). Besides the projects and properties
	noted above, we have a number of other mineral property holdings at various
	stages of exploration in Argentina, Canada, Chile, Mexico and the United States.
	In categorizing our projects, we consider, among other things, the priority of

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	From initial production until the middle of 2011, the Company
	sold its silver and zinc concentrates to a single trading counterparty. Sales of
	concentrate to this company amounted to 100% of total metal sales in 2011.
	Generally, the loss of a single trading counterparty would not adversely affect
	the Company due to the liquidity of the markets and the availability of
	alternative trading counterparties.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In the second half of 2011, the Company commenced marketing discussions
	with several third party smelters, refiners, and traders for the sale of its
	silver and zinc concentrates. The Company has completed various sales contracts
	in 2012 with various counterparties to diversify its revenue base. In the future,
	the loss of any one smelting and refining client may have a material adverse
	effect on the Company if alternate smelters and refiners are not available.
	The Company believes there is sufficient global capacity available to address
	the loss of any one smelter.

	Fiscal stability agreement and regulatory environment

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Pirquitas Mine has a fiscal stability agreement with the
	government of Argentina dating from 1998. In 2002, the government of Argentina
	implemented an export duty on concentrates that did not apply to companies with
	pre-existing fiscal stability agreements. In December 2007 the National
	Customs Authority of Argentina levied an export duty of approximately
	10% from concentrates for projects with fiscal stability agreements pre-dating
	2002. The Company has been advised that the Pirquitas Mine is subject to this
	export duty despite contrary rights detailed under the 1998 fiscal stability
	agreement. The legality of the export duty applied to silver concentrates has
	been challenged and is currently under review by the court in Argentina. In July
	2010, the Company filed a claim in the provincial court for repayment of export
	duties paid on silver concentrates, and for an order to cease payment of the
	export duty until the matter has been decided by the court. An order was granted
	effective September 29, 2010 to cease payment of the export duty on silver
	concentrates pending the decision of the courts, and in April 2011 a government
	appeal against this order was denied.

	As of December 31, 2011 the Pirquitas Mine has paid $6.6
	million in export duties against which it has filed for recovery. In accordance
	with the order to cease payment the Company has not been paying export duties on
	silver concentrate but continues to accrue duties in full until the outcome of
	the claim is known with certainty. At December 31, 2011, the Company had accrued
	a liability totaling $13.1 million, with a corresponding impact on cost of sales
	in the relevant period. If this export duty is successfully overturned the full
	amount of paid and unpaid duty will be recognized in the Consolidated Statement

	In August 2005, Esperanza advised us of the acquisition of
	certain mineral concessions, known as the San Luis Project, as the result of an
	evaluation program carried out under the evaluation agreement. On September 6,
	2005, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Esperanza for the
	exploration of the San Luis Project (the &#147;San Luis Joint Venture&#148;) on the terms
	set out above and elected to increase our interest in the joint venture to 55%
	by funding the first $500,000 in exploration expenditures. During 2006, we earned a 55% interest in the joint venture and
	commenced incurring $1.5 million in exploration expenditures with Esperanza in
	proportion to our respective interests in the joint venture. In March 2006, we
	received notice from Esperanza that the joint venture had incurred $1.5 million
	in exploration expenditures on the San Luis Project. Following receipt of the
	notice, we elected to increase our interest in the San Luis Joint Venture to 70%
	by paying all costs required to be incurred to complete a feasibility study. In
	June 2010, we completed a feasibility study, and accordingly our interest
	automatically increased to 70%.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We acquired the Duthie Property in November 1978 for its then
	known silver reserve, based on the then prevailing price of silver, along with a
	functioning mill. The Duthie Property is located 12 kilometers west of Smithers,
	British Columbia and approximately 1.2 kilometers north of Aldrich Lake. It
	operated intermittently from 1923 until the mid-1980s. Over much of this period,
	some hand-picked direct-shipping ore was mined, especially in the early years.
	Of an estimated 80,000 tons mined, about 59,400 tons were milled. Concentrate
	shipments totalled 7,144 tons.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	At the time of acquisition of the Duthie Property, we were not
	responsible for, and had no obligation in respect of, the reclamation of
	historical tailings. In the early 1990s, British Columbia adopted legislation
	which resulted in us becoming responsible for the reclamation of historical
	tailings on the Duthie Property. As a result, we submitted a reclamation
	proposal for the tailings impoundment area that contained three reclamation
	options to the Province of British Columbia in March 1994. The completed study,
	which defines the most appropriate reclamation option, was submitted to the
	Province of British Columbia in March, 1998. A reclamation option was accepted
	by the Province of British Columbia in June 1999, subject to possible
	refinements. During 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we carried out reclamation work
	of $526,700, $634,200, $22,500 and $64,300, respectively. In 2011, our
	reclamation work program was completed at a cost of $15,800. Remaining
	reclamation obligations beyond 2011 include constructing a wetland and
	monitoring the results in subsequent years. Estimated costs for the remaining
	reclamation beyond 2011 are $935,500 which includes $25,000 per year for 10
	years of ongoing environmental monitoring.

	conceptual reclamation plan, we have estimated the fair value of the liability
	associated with the reclamation of the property to be $2.7 million. A
	reclamation permit was issued by the Province of British Columbia in July of
	2010. In 2011, approximately $529,300 in expenditures for reclamation work were

	Puna de Atacama in the Province of Jujuy of northwestern Argentina. The project
	is held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Mina Pirquitas, Inc. (formerly known
	as Sunshine Argentina, Inc.), and is located approximately 355
	kilometers northwest of the city of San Salvador de Jujuy. Access to the site is
	by public paved and gravel roads. The terrain surrounding the mine is
	mountainous, with elevations ranging from 4,100 to 4,400 meters above sea level.
	There are no nearby electrical power or telecommunication lines; however, the
	Trans Andean natural gas pipeline is located approximately 36 kilometers to the
	south of the project and a spur gas line was constructed to the site. A power
	plant was constructed at the site that provides all power required for the mine
	and processing plant. See the following Pirquitas Project, Location Map.

	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Pirquitas is the largest historical producer of tin and silver
	in Argentina. The following is a chronological description of mining that has
	occurred at Pirquitas:
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	1932-1935&nbsp;
<STRONG>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</STRONG>
	Tin placer deposits were first discovered in the area in 1932. Dredging
	of the tin placers commenced in 1933.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	1935-1990&nbsp;
<STRONG>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</STRONG>
	The bedrock source of the tin placers was discovered in 1935 and mining
	of the tin and silver lodes started soon thereafter. Twelve mines operated in
	the area. Often, mineralization found in one mine would extend into the workings
	of the adjacent mine, and as a consequence several of the mines eventually
	became interconnected. The largest operations were the San Miguel, Chocaya,
	Llallagua, and Potosi mines. Reported total metal production during this time is
	estimated to be 777,600 kg of silver, 9,100 tonnes of tin from placer deposits,
	and 18,200 tonnes of tin mined from the vein systems. 1995-2003 Sunshine
	Argentina, Inc. (&#147;Sunshine Argentina&#148;) acquired the Pirquitas property in a
	bankruptcy auction in November 1995. Sunshine Argentina&#146;s exploration program
	included survey control, geophysical surveys, geological mapping, sampling, and
	drilling. All accessible underground workings were sampled and mapped. Sunshine
	Argentina also conducted extensive diamond and reverse circulation drilling from
	surface as well as diamond core drilling from rehabilitated underground
	workings. A feasibility study was completed for the project by Sunshine
	Argentina in 2000.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	2004-2005&nbsp;
<STRONG>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</STRONG>
	With the acquisition of a 100% interest in the Pirquitas Project, we
	commenced updating the feasibility study that was completed in 2000 to take into
	account current economic conditions. We also commenced an underground ramp to
	(a) provide a platform area to allow underground drilling, to better define the
	base of the open pit as proposed in the 2000 feasibility study and (b) access
	the Oploca vein mineralization, which is located outside the open pit.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	2006&nbsp;

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</STRONG>
	&nbsp;
<STRONG>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</STRONG>
	In 2006, we announced the completion of the update to the previous
	feasibility study along with proven and probable reserves for the Pirquitas
	Project. We also announced our decision to proceed with the development of the
	Pirquitas mine. As part of our exploration efforts, we continued with the
	underground ramp that accessed the Oploca vein mineralization.

	2008-2011&nbsp;
<STRONG>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</STRONG>
	During this period we completed the construction of
	the Pirquitas mine. The Pirquitas mine achieved production status in December
	2009, and produced 6.3 million ounces of silver in 2010. The Pirquitas Mine
	began zinc shipments in 2011 and produced 10.1 million pounds of zinc and 7.1
	million ounces of silver during the year. On November 9, 2011 the Company
	announced a reduction to the estimated mineral reserve at Pirquitas incorporated
	into the mine plan, and filed on SEDAR a NI 43-101 Technical Report dated
	December 23, 2011 titled &#147;NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Pirquitas Mine,

	Geology and Mineralization
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Northwestern Argentina can be subdivided into three main
	geological terranes or belts which are oriented with north-northeasterly trends.
	From east to west, these terranes are referred to as the Sub-Andean Belt, the
	Eastern Cordillera, and the Puna, where the Pirquitas Project is located. These
	terranes are distinguished on the basis of their basement lithology, complexes,
	tectonic histories, magmatism, metallogeny and geomorphologies.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The
<I>
	puna
</I>
	terrane underlies most of the western half of
	Jujuy Province and is marked by a high-Andean geomorphology consisting of
	northerly trending mountain ranges separated by broad valleys and salars or salt
	pans. Elevations range from 3,900 to as high as 6,700 meters above sea level.
	Paleozoic marine sedimentary formations are the main basement rocks in the puna,
	with thick deposits of continental clastics existing where sedimentary basins
	had developed during Mesozoic time subsequent to a major compressional tectonic
	event that had caused crustal uplift and intense folding during the Early
	Devonian. By Middle Tertiary time, the tectonic regime of the puna had changed
	to one of extension, resulting in a basin and range geomorphology being
	developed. As well, the extensional tectonism resulted in the upwelling of magma
	and the development of andesitic to dacitic stratovolcanoes and subsequently a
	number of very large caldera structures from which regionally extensive
	ignimbrite sheets were erupted. These volcanic edifices and deposits are readily
	seen in the present landscape surrounding the Pirquitas Project.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In terms of mineral deposit endowment, the puna is by far the
	most important of the three regional terranes in Jujuy Province. There are four
	main types of mineral deposits in the puna: mesothermal quartz veins containing
	gold and minor amounts of base metals; polymetallic quartz veins genetically
	related to Tertiary volcanic centers; &#147;Bolivian-type&#148; silver-tin sulphide veins
	of which Pirquitas is the best example; and Quaternary placer deposits of gold
	and tin.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	At Pirquitas, the silver-zinc-tin mineralization is hosted by a
	folded and fractured succession of interbedded units of marine sandstone,
	siltstone and minor shale of Ordovician age. The metals of interest occur in a
	variety of sulphide minerals that were deposited in large fractures to form a
	number of east-west trending veins that are a few hundreds of meters in length
	and generally 50 to 200 centimeters wide. Between the larger veins there are
	irregular networks of sulphide veinlets as well as disseminated sulphide grains
	in some of the more porous lithologies. The San Miguel open-pit is mainly
	exploiting a broad zone of sulphide veinlets and disseminations that was defined
	by drilling immediately south of the historically most productive vein
	structure, the Potos&#237; Vein. Silver, zinc and tin commonly occur together in
	mineralized samples, however, their concentrations in the deposit as a whole are
	not directly co-relatable. Silver in the deposit takes the form of silver
	sulphide, acanthite, and as a number of silver sulphosalt minerals. Zinc occurs
	in the sulphides of sphalerite and wurzite, while tin is found mainly in
	stannite along with a number of other rare sulphide and sulphosalt minerals.

	Construction of the mine and all associated infrastructure was

	2009, and produced 1.1 million ounces of silver during that year. In 2010, the
	mine produced 6.3 million ounces of silver of which 5.9 million ounces were
	shipped that year. In 2011, we produced 7.1 million ounces of silver and 10.1
	million pounds of zinc. Due to lengthy production stoppages caused by mechanical
	problems that first affected our crushing capacity and then our milling, the total amount of silver produced in 2011 was
	less than what had been anticipated at the beginning of the year.

	After the repairs to the ball-mill gearbox were completed and
	full milling capacity was restored in the middle of November, 2011, our silver
	production has returned to design levels. For 2012, we anticipate that Pirquitas
	will produce between 8.2 and 8.5 million ounces of silver.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Pirquitas Mine has total property, plant and equipment with
	a net book value of $342.8 million, of which $102.2 million, relates to mineral
	properties i.e. acquisition and capitalized pre-operating costs and plant and
	equipment of $240.6 million. The plant and equipment comprises the cost for
	plant construction, mobile equipment and ongoing sustaining capital. See Item
	5.A &#147;Operating Results &#150; Pirquitas Mine, Argentina&#148; for a discussion of capital
	expenditures and additional information on the Pirquitas Mine. Please also refer

	The following mineral reserve estimates for the Pirquitas
	Project were prepared by Andrew Sharp, Vice President Technical Services under
	the supervision of qualified person, Bruce Kennedy, P.Eng., General Manager of
	the Pirquitas Mine, in accordance with the standards of Canadian National
	Instrument 43-101 and the definitions of the CIM Standards. Disclosure of
	&#147;contained ounces&#148; is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however,
	the SEC only permits issuers to report &#147;resources&#148; as in place tonnage and grade
	without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information concerning
	descriptions of mineralization and resources noted below may not be comparable
	to information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and

	approximately 25 kilometers northwest of Barrick Gold Corporation&#146;s Pierina gold
	mine (see San Luis Project Location Map shown below). Having completed the
	purchase of Esperanza&#146;s remaining 30% interest in the project in 2011, we now
	hold a 100% interest in the project. The property lies within the Cordillera
	Negra mountain range at elevations that range from 3,800 to 4,700 meters above
	sea level. The project can be accessed by two all-weather roads from the town of
	Casma on the Pacific Coast and from the town of Huaraz which lies in the valley
	of Santa River that flows east of the property. Electrical power for our
	exploration camp is currently generated on-site using diesel generators.

	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The veins that are the focus of interest at the San Luis
	Project were discovered in mid-2005 by an Esperanza field crew carrying out a
	prospecting program under the evaluation joint venture that existed at the time
	between Esperanza and Silver Standard. Following the discovery in July 2005,
	Esperanza, as the operator of the San Luis joint venture completed channel
	sampling of the Ayel&#233;n Vein, one of five veins that were identified in the field
	at that time. Channel samples were spaced approximately every 25 meters (82
	feet) along the strike length of the Ayel&#233;n Vein. Based on the results of the
	channel sampling, a diamond drill program was commenced by Esperanza in late
	2006.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On April 1, 2007, we assumed the role of operator for the San
	Luis Joint Venture and continued with the diamond drill program. From 2006 to
	2008, the joint venture completed 33,600 meters of diamond drilling in 154
	holes. In 2010, we completed a feasibility study for the development of the San
	Luis Project. In 2011 we signed a land access agreement with the Cochabamba
	community.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	Geology and Mineralization
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	At the San Luis Project, gold and silver-bearing quartz veins
	are hosted within Tertiary-age volcanic rocks. Five separate,
	north-northwesterly trending veins have been identified so far with a cumulative
	strike length of over 5,000 meters; however, at this time only one of the veins,
	the Ayel&#233;n Vein, hosts an economic deposit of precious metal mineralization.
	Individual veins range from several hundreds of meters to over 2,000 meters in
	strike length and are up to 10 meters wide though widths of one to three meters
	are more common.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The well mineralized Ayel&#233;n Vein is typical of quartz-adularia
	or low-sulfidation epithermal precious metal vein systems. Vein textures such as
	well-developed banding and multiple brecciation indicate that repeated episodes
	of quartz deposition occurred, with gold and silver likely being precipitated
	from the fluids as they ascended towards the paleo-surface and boiled. Modeling
	of the concentration of precious metals within and along the Ayel&#233;n Vein
	indicates that high-grade mineralization forms subvertically elongated zones
	commonly referred to as &#145;ore shoots&#146;.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	Status
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In June 2010, we completed a feasibility study for the
	development of the project, and in the fall of 2010, we submitted our
	environmental impact assessment study to the Peruvian Ministry of Mines and
	Energy. In December 2011, we executed a long-term, land-use agreement with the
	Cochabamba community, one of the two local communities. We are in negotiations
	with the other local community to secure the other required long-term, land-use
	agreement. We will make a construction decision once we have received approval
	of the environmental impact assessment and entered into the remaining required
	land-use agreements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On February 28, 2011, we entered into a share purchase
	agreement with Esperanza, our then joint venture partner in the San Luis
	Project, to purchase all of Esperanza&#146;s remaining interest in the project which
	closed on July 28, 2011. See Item 4.B &#150; &#147;Business Overview &#150; Mineral Projects &#150;

	Reserve Estimates
</I>

	The following mineral reserve estimates for the San Luis
	Project were prepared by Steve L. Milne, P.E. of Tucson, AZ, and presented in a
	technical report dated June 4, 2010, in accordance with the standards of
	Canadian National Instrument 43-101 and the definitions of the CIM Standards.
	Disclosure of &#147;contained ounces&#148; is permitted disclosure under Canadian
	regulations; however, the SEC only permits issuers to report &#147;resources&#148; as in
	place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization and

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our wholly-owned Pitarrilla Project is located in the
	north-central part of the State of Durango, Mexico. The Pitarrilla property is
	easily accessible year-round and can be reached by traveling along all-weather
	roads either from the small town of San Francisco de Asis or the village of
	Casas Blancas via the town of El Palmito. The required driving time from the
	city of Durango is about 4 hours (approximately 260 km by road). See the
	Pitarrilla Project Location Map shown below.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Being situated in a high-desert environment, the climate at
	Pitarrilla is generally an arid one. The hottest and driest months are from May
	through July, with day-time temperatures generally greater than 45&#176;C. During the
	winter months, December through February, day-time temperatures range from 15&#176;C
	to 25&#176;C, while night-time temperatures are generally in the -5&#176;C to 10&#176;C range.
	The wettest months are August through October, with most of the annual rainfall
	of about 500 mm coming during this period.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Supplies and resources, including fuel and groceries, are
	available in the town of Rodeo which is a two hour drive to the southeast.
	Limited supplies are available in San Francisco de Asis and no services are
	available in Casas Blancas. The company has accommodations, a mess hall and a
	warehouse in Casas Blancas. Most large items, supplies, assay laboratories and
	air transportation are available in the cities of Durango and Gomez
	Palacio-Torreon. Electrical power for the camp facilities is obtained from the
	existing power grid. Power alternatives for the Pitarrilla Project in connection
	with the preparation of a Feasibility Study are being evaluated.

	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Consulting geologists P. Durning and F. Hillemeyer of La Cuesta
	International Inc. (LCI) first recognized the mineral potential at Pitarrilla in
	1995 as part of a generative gold exploration program for Monarch Resources Ltd.
	In 2002, we entered into an agreement with LCI to claim what is now the core
	area of the current property. Following programs of geological mapping, rock
	sampling and reverse circulation drilling, the Company reported in October, 2003
	the discovery of the Cordon Colorado, Pe&#241;a Dyke and Javelina Creek mineralized
	zones. Subsequent diamond drilling campaigns resulted in the discovery of two
	additional zones of silver mineralization, the South Ridge and Breccia Ridge
	zones. In the six years following the discovery at Cordon Colorado, the Company
	drilled 186 reverse circulation boreholes with a combined length of
	approximately 20,600 meters as well as 365 diamond drill-holes with a total
	length of approximately 180,200 meters. In addition, a decline ramp was
	developed underground during 2007 and 2008 in an effort to gain access to the
	sulphide-associated Ag-Pb-Zn mineralization of the Breccia Ridge Zone.
	Approximately 1,350 meters of decline were excavated; however the underground
	development was halted at the end of 2008 due to the global economic crisis,
	with the ramp ending short of its target depth. A further 83 diamond drill-holes
	with a total length of approximately 13,900 meters were drilled in 2011.

<I>
	Geology and Mineralization
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Pitarrilla silver-zinc-lead deposit is characterized by
	iron oxide- and sulphide-associated mineralization, which together defines a
	vertically stacked mineralized system centred on an intrusive complex of
	rhyolitic dikes and sills that constitute the feeder system for a rhyolitic
	flow-dome. These subvolcanic rocks are estimated to have formed roughly 30
	million years ago (during the Oligocene) and were emplaced into a sequence of
	somewhat older Eocene volcaniclastic rocks. More than 450 meters below surface,
	the Eocene volcaniclastic rocks are underlain by folded marine sedimentary
	strata, mainly siltstones and sandstones, that are believed to be older than 60
	million years. A conglomerate formation separates the sedimentary succession
	from the overlying younger volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. The
	sulphide-associated silver mineralization is rooted in the basement sedimentary
	strata and comprises a vertically extensive zone of disseminated and
	veinlet-forming Ag-Zn-Pb(-Cu-As-Sb) sulphide mineralization. In addition,
	replacement-style sulphide mineralization exists stratabound within the
	conglomerate formation. The sulphide mineralization that forms the central
	Breccia Ridge Ag-Zn-Pb zone extends upwards into the overlying Eocene
	volcaniclastic strata and into Oligocene rhyolitic sills where it abruptly
	grades into a laterally more extensive zone of disseminated iron
	oxide-associated silver mineralization. The Cordon Colorado, Pe&#241;a Dyke, Javelina
	Creek and South Ridge silver zones are marked by ubiquitous but minor amounts of
	iron and manganese oxides that are believed to have formed through the oxidation
	of disseminated sulphides. The main Ag-Zn-Pb mineralization event is interpreted
	to have occurred during or relatively soon after emplacement of the Oligocene
	rhyolitic dome.

	A NI 43-101 Technical Report &#150; Pitarrilla Property
	Pre-Feasibility study on the economic viability of an underground mining
	operation on the Pitarrilla Property was prepared by mining consultants Wardrop,
	A Tetra Tech Company (&#147;Wardrop&#148;) in September of 2009 (the &#147;Preliminary
	Feasibility Study&#148;). As presented in Wardrop&#146;s Preliminary Feasibility Study,
	the underground project was to have a 12-year mine life, would mine 4,000 tonnes
	per day and produce approximately seven million ounces of silver per year.
	Capital costs were projected at $277 million with average operating costs of
	$33.81/tonne. Metal recoveries vary by rock type with expected weighted average
	recoveries of 88.4% for silver, 93.2% for zinc and 89.6% for lead.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Ore processing would produce two concentrates, a lead
	concentrate which would contain the bulk of recovered silver and a zinc
	concentrate. The lead concentrate was expected to average 60.7% lead and contain approximately 8,000 g/t silver. The zinc concentrate
	was expected to average 48.5% zinc and contain approximately 400 g/t silver.

	In the Preliminary Feasibility Study completed by Wardrop, the
	capital cost estimate (CAPEX) was determined with an accuracy of &#177;25% and is
	suitable for project evaluation and client budgeting. The Pitarrilla Project&#146;s
	CAPEX consists of four main parts: direct costs, indirect costs, contingency,
	and owner&#146;s costs. As of April 2009, the CAPEX for the Project was estimated at
	$277 million. The estimate is subject to qualifications, assumptions, and
	exclusions, as detailed in the Preliminary Feasibility Study. The economic
	evaluation of the Pitarrilla Project was prepared by Wardrop based on a pre-tax
	financial model. For the 12-year mine life and 16.7 Mt reserve, the following
	pre-tax financial parameters were calculated: 10.9% internal rate of return
	(IRR); 6.2 years payback on $277 million capital; $107.4 million net present
	value (NPV) at a 5% discount rate. The base case prices supplied by the Company
	were as follows: silver &#150; $11.00/oz, zinc &#150; $0.70/lb, lead &#150; $0.50/oz.
	Sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the project economics for
	2-year, 5-year, and current metal prices. The financial outcomes for four metal
	price scenarios were tabulated for NPV, IRR and payback of capital. Discount
	rates of 10%, 8%, and 5% were applied to all cases identified by the following
	metal price scenarios: base case, 2-year average, 5-year average, and current
	prices. The five year average prices for silver, zinc, and lead were $11.16/oz,
	$0.99/lb and $0.72/lb, respectively. The two year average prices for silver,
	zinc, and lead were $14.06/oz, $1.01/lb and $1.02/lb, respectively, and the spot
	prices at the time of the study for silver, zinc, and lead were $14.02/oz,
	$0.71/lb and $0.77/lb, respectively. The results are presented below:

	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Discovered in the 1970s, the property was primarily explored
	from 1988 to 2001. A mineral deposit know as the Oculto deposit was initially
	defined by 17 diamond drill-holes totaling 3,010 meters and 79 reverse
	circulation holes totaling 19,114 meters, with this drilling being done by
	previous property holders BHP-Utah and Pacific Rim Mining. Barrick, under an
	option to purchase agreement with Pacific Rim Mining drilled an additional 24
	diamond drill holes and 150 reverse circulation holes during the period of
	1997-1999. Following our deposition of the project in 2003, we drilled 20
	drill-holes totaling 3,046 meters, mainly to test geophysical anomalies outside
	of the Oculto deposit and to test for continuity of several high-grade zones
	within the known deposit. The peripheral drilling intersected several areas with
	minor gold and silver mineralization. The drilling within the Oculto deposit
	zone confirmed continuity of the mineralization forming the deposit. During
	2006, a geological review of the project, done as part of an update of the
	Barrick pre-feasibility study determined that the previous reverse circulation
	drilling may have understated the gold and silver values. As a result, a diamond
	drilling program of approximately 17,600 meters in 107 drill holes was completed
	by us in 2007 and 2008. This drilling program was designed to investigate
	whether previously obtained drilling results understated gold concentrates and
	also to test a number of gold targets separate from the Oculto Zone where a
	reinterpretation of the geology indicates potential for the discovery of new
	gold zones.

	Geology and Mineralization
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The gold and silver deposit at the Diablillos Project is
	interpreted to be an example of the high-sulphidation subgroup of the epithermal
	class of precious metal deposits. The mineralization is predominantly hosted by
	volcanic tuffs, breccias and minor flows that have been intensely leached by
	acidic fluids which rendered these rocks to be highly porous. The acidic fluids
	that strongly altered the mineralized rocks are believed to have formed by two
	processes, in part by magmatic vapors reacting with ground waters during the
	primary mineralizing event, and then later by the near-surface oxidation of
	sulphide mineral grains which had been deposited from the deposit-forming
	hydrothermal fluids. Lying directly below the sequence of Tertiary volcanic
	rocks is a basal conglomerate formation that contains pebbles and cobbles of
	older, underlying rocks, including Paleozoic granite and metamorphosed
	sedimentary rocks. The conglomerate is a particularly important host to the
	precious metal mineralization, especially zones with higher concentrations of
	gold. Two main sets of faults have affected the rocks at Diablillos; ENE-WSW
	trending structures appear to have been important conduits that channeled the
	hydrothermal fluids which deposited gold and silver in the conglomerate
	formation and overlying volcanic rocks, whereas N-S fault structures are
	interpreted to be younger than the ENE-WSW faults and define the margins of a
	downward-displaced structural block that includes the Oculto deposit.

	The bulk of the Oculto gold-silver deposit is hosted by
	oxidized and porous volcanic and sedimentary rocks containing abundant hematite,
	limonite and jarosite. Gold generally occurs as fine grains of native gold and
	electrum, while silver is found as fine grains of acanthite (silver sulphide),
	chlorargyrite (silver halide), matildite (silver bismuth sulphide) as well as
	with gold in electrum. Owing to the relatively high grades of gold and silver in
	the Oculto mineralization and the less anticipated recoveries of these metals by
	heap-leach processing methods, the Oculto deposit is being considered for a
	conventional milling operation.

	cutoff grade of $10/tonne. The RMV was based on metal values of $11/oz silver
	and $700/oz gold, and applied recoveries of 65% for gold and 40% for silver.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The local geology at San Agustin is dominated by a subvolcanic
	intrusive complex that was emplaced into a folded and faulted sequence of thinly
	bedded, fine-grained marine clastic sedimentary rocks that are believed to be
	more than 30 million years older than the intrusive rocks. The emplacement of
	the dacite porphyry intrusive rocks apparently resulted in the dense fracturing
	and local brecciation of the sedimentary rocks over a broad area, which
	facilitated the migration of metal-bearing hydrothermal fluids outwards from the
	intrusive stock into the enclosing sedimentary rocks. These fluids deposited
	pyrite and lesser amounts of sphalerite as disseminated grains and stringer
	veinlets in both the feldspar-porphyritic intrusive rocks and the fine-grained
	interbedded sandstone and siltone units. At depths of 30 meters and more below
	the surface, in unoxidized rocks, the precious metal mineralization generally
	consists of disseminated grains and stringer veinlets of pyrite that contain
	minute inclusions of gold, while silver is more commonly associated with zinc
	and lead sulphides in veinlets. Within 30 meters of surface, most of the rocks
	have been oxidized, with sulphide minerals being converted to iron oxide
	minerals, namely hematite, goethite and limonite. In terms of gold recovery, the
	oxidized mineralization is more favourable than the sulphide-associated
	mineralization, especially considering the low-grade nature of the pyritic
	mineralization.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Prior to us acquiring the property, exploration activities that
	were done on the property in the 1990&#146;s consisted of geological mapping, soil
	sampling and the drilling of 69 reverse circulation boreholes totaling 10,400
	meters which outlined the first gold-silver resource to be identified at San
	Agustin. In early 2004, we completed a reverse circulation drilling program,
	which totaled 3,890 meters in 24 holes.

	In 2006, Geologix Exploration (&#147;Geologix&#148;) entered into an
	option to purchase agreement with Silver Standard for the San Agustin property.
	In the following two years, Geologix completed a 175-hole, 40,700 meter diamond
	drilling program in accordance with the terms of the option agreement (see Item
	4.B - &#147;Business Overview &#150; Mineral Properties &#150; San Agustin Project&#148;). At the
	end of 2008, a mineral resource estimate was completed for Geologix by mining
	consultants Wardrop, a Tetra Tech Company. Two months later, in early 2009,
	Geologix was unable to meet its option payment obligations as defined by the
	agreement due to the global financial crisis that was taking place at that time,
	and as a consequence, the purchase option was terminated. In 2010, we decided to
	resume our own exploration of the property, completing a program of multi-method
	geophysical surveying together with some re-logging of drill cores for a
	re-interpretation of the geological controls on the mineralization that
	constitutes the gold-silver(zinc) deposit. Plans are to resume exploration work
	at San Agustin in 2012 by completing another drilling campaign to expand the
	known resources and to test some of the geophysical anomalies that were outlined
	in 2010.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The silver-copper-manganese deposit at the center of the
	Berenguela Project is hosted by a strongly folded sequence of marine sedimentary
	rocks consisting of interbedded units of limestone, dolomite, marl (impure
	carbonate), sandstone and minor shale. A formation rich in gypsum, probably an
	evaporite, occurs in the lower part of the succession which is believed to have
	been deposited roughly 100 million years ago. Mineralization consists of massive
	replacement of limestone, dolomite and to a lesser extent marl beds by manganese
	oxide minerals which contain variable amounts of silver and copper. How silver
	and copper actually occur in the mineralization is not well understood, but
	mineral phases of silver and copper are rarely observed with the naked eye.
	Overall, the deposit consists of a few lenticular bodies of replacement
	mineralization that are grossly conformable with, and occur within 100 meters of
	the surface which occurs at an elevation of about 4,200 meters above sea
	level.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The deposit was mined intermittently between 1905 and 1965 by
	the Lampa Mining Company, principally for silver. In the 1960s, Charter
	Consolidated Mining Co. and then Asarco Inc. assessed the mining potential of
	the Berenguela deposit. The two companies completed a total of 6,600 meters of
	diamond drilling and channel-sampled underground workings at 1.5 -meter
	intervals for a total of 5,108 meters. In 1968, Charter Consolidated developed
	an open-pit plan, and calculated a mineable ore reserve for the project. Since
	the closure of the mine in 1965, no significant quantity of ore has been
	recovered from the project. The ore reserve estimated by Charter Consolidated
	does not comply with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 and CIM Standards;
	under these mining industry guidelines, Charter Consolidated&#146;s &#145;mineable
	reserve&#146; would be classified as a mineral resource only.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In the late 1960s, the Peruvian Government nationalized the
	Berenguela Project. SOMINBESA acquired the project from Minero Peru (a state
	owned mining company) in 1995 and completed engineering studies for the
	development of the project. Under our option agreement, we agreed to undertake
	additional drilling and prepare a resource estimate for the project in
	accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 and the CIM Standards.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	From late 2004 through mid-2005, we completed a reverse circulation
	drill program that totaled 19,029 meters in 222 holes. The program objectives
	were: (1) to twin historic, relatively wide-spaced drill-holes to verify the
	grade of mineralization, and (2) to complete sufficient in-fill drilling in
	two areas of deposit to determine the scope of future drilling requirements
	for a measured, indicated and inferred resource. In 2010, we undertook a broader
	assessment of the mineral potential of the property by completing a comprehensive
	program of geophysical surveying, a soil geochemistry survey and campaign of
	diamond drilling. The drilling program consisted of 16 boreholes, with a total
	of 5,546 meters being drilled. Only three of 2010 drill-holes tested the area
	of the known Ag-Cu-Mn deposit, with the remaining holes probing geophysical
	anomalies that were outlined to the east, west and south of the deposit. A preliminary
	economic assessment study was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2010 and continued
	until March, 2011 when it was terminated before its completion. The early-stage
	metallurgical and engineering studies that were done for the preliminary economic
	assessment were performed by mining consultants Kappes, Casssidy &amp; Associates.
	No exploration or other types of work programs were carried out on the property
	in 2011.

	Nazas Project
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Until October, 2011, the property that constitutes the Nazas
	Project was a collection of 31 contiguous mineral concessions located in
	north-central Durango State, Mexico, that lies about 17 kilometers east of our
	Pitarrilla project (refer to the Nazas Project Location Map, shown below).
	Covering a total of 23,591 hectares, the property is a collection of four claims
	purchased from Camino Minerals Corp., two claims that were acquired through a
	prospecting agreement with La Cuesta International, Inc., and 25 small claims
	under an option to purchase agreement with Minerales y Productos Metalurgicos
	S.A. de C.V., a private Mexican mining company. The project can be accessed from
	the city of Torreon or the city of Durango by travelling paved highways to a
	point a few kilometers north of the town of Rodeo where a dirt road turns off to
	the northwest, eventually reaching the property as it passes along the Nazas
	River. The trip to the property from Torreon takes about 4 hours, and is about 5
	hours from Durango.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our exploration efforts at the Nazas Project are directed at
	discovering deposits of epithermal gold and silver mineralization. In 2011, we
	completed a systematic and comprehensive exploration program that consisted of
	multiple methods of geophysical surveying (ground magnetics, induced
	polarization chargeability and resistivity, gravimetrics and magneto-tellurics
	resistivity), geological mapping and rock sampling and the diamond drilling of
	20 boreholes for a combined length of 11,641 meters. Several of the drillholes
	targeted large epithermal quartz veins that contain weak but significant gold
	mineralization at surface. Other drillholes were designed to test at depths of
	more than 300 meters below surface the intersection between subvertical faults
	and a subhorizontal contact between an upper package of Tertiary volcanic rocks
	and significantly older sedimentary rocks. Such a geological setting is found at
	our Pitarrilla Project where it is proven to be highly prospective for
	silver-rich F-Zn-Pb mineralization. While a number of the 2011 drillholes
	intersected mineralized zones containing anomalous concentrations of gold,
	silver, zinc and lead, a mineral resource was not delineated by our drilling. As
	a consequence, the decision was made in October, 2011 to terminate the option to
	purchase agreement with Minerales y Productos Metalurgicos S.A. de C.V. for the
	25 small claims included in the Nazas Projects. However, the remaining six
	claims at Nazas which we control 100% subject to royalty interests held by La
	Cuesta International, Inc. will continue to be explored in the future.

	kilometers east of the Pan American Highway at an elevation of 1,500 meters
	above sea level (refer to the Challacollo Location Map, shown below). The
	property comprises approximately 37.5 square kilometers and essentially covers a
	range of high, rocky hills that is surrounded by sandy plains of the Atacama
	Desert. The project can be readily accessed by following a good dirt road that
	connects the site of the former Challacollo silver mine to the Pan American
	Highway. In order to maintain our rights to the concessions that comprise the
	project, we are required to pay annual

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Challacollo Project is focused on four main north-south
	trending epithermal quartz veins and silicified breccia structures that are
	hosted by volcanic tuffs and flows that were deposited on considerably older
	marine sedimentary rocks. The Lol&#243;n Vein is the largest and most productive
	vein; it is more than 3,500 meters in length, locally up to 13 meters wide, and
	was historically mined for silver along a 700 m-long section of the structure
	where multiple episodes of quartz deposition and brecciation can be observed.
	Below the zone of surficial oxidation, silver is associated with lead and zinc
	sulphides, but in the former underground mine the vein rock is oxidized, where
	primary sulphide minerals have been replaced by iron oxides, with silver
	occurring in supergene mineral phases.

	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the two decades between the closure of the underground
	mine and us acquiring the Challacollo Project in 2001, a number of mining
	companies held exploration options to explore the property. These companies
	completed underground sampling and drilled a total of 22 boreholes that tested a
	number of veins. Following our acquisition of the property, we completed an
	extensive sampling program of the underground workings at 25 meter intervals,
	collecting and analyzing more than 1,000 chip-channel samples. In addition, a
	seven-hole, 746-meter drill program was carried out and tested approximately
	600 meters of strike length of the Lol&#243;n Vein. In 2003, a follow-up
	drilling program of 5,685 meters was completed for in-fill and step-out
	purposes. Combining the assay results obtained by the 2002 and 2003 drilling
	campaigns with assays obtained from underground channel samples, we were able to
	prepare a resource estimate for the project in accordance with Canadian National
	Instrument 43-101 and the CIM Standards. More recently, in 2007, we completed a
	37-hole, 7,986-meter reverse circulation drill program with the objective of
	expanding resources along the known veins and to test for porphyry-related
	copper mineralization. In 2010, we contracted to have multiple geophysical
	surveys performed over the property, including airborne magnetics and
	radiometrics surveys. We also completed a grid-controlled rock-sampling survey,
	where samples were collected for geochemical analysis as well as mineralogical
	spectral analysis. The new geophysical and geochemical data have been used to
	identify several drill targets that will be tested in the future.

	Our wholly-owned Candelaria Mine Project is located in the
	Candelaria Hills in west central Nevada approximately 55 miles south of
	Hawthorne, Nevada and approximately five miles west of Highway 95, which
	connects Reno, Nevada to Las Vegas, Nevada. Access to the property is by paved
	road from Highway 95. The mine site is connected to the local power grid and has
	water wells and pumping equipment in place. See the following Candelaria Mine
	Project Location Map.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Candelaria District developed into the richest silver
	district in the State of Nevada, following discovery of high-grade mineralized
	quartz veins in 1864. From then until 1954, the property produced 22 million
	ounces of silver. The property was acquired by Occidental Minerals and later
	Nerco Minerals, who built a processing facility and operated the mine from 1980
	until 1989. During that time they produced over 33 million ounces of silver.
	Kinross Candelaria Mining Company, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
	Kinross Gold, purchased the Candelaria mine in 1994 and operated the mine until
	January 1999. Kinross produced over 13 million ounces of silver, bringing the
	total historical production for the property to over 68 million ounces of
	silver.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Mineralization within the district is confined to the
	Candelaria Shear, a linear zone of brittle-ductile deformation related to
	faulting. High-grade veins form along contacts of felsic rock dikes that
	were intruded into the shear zone that is developed in a sequence of
	Tertiary volcanic rocks. Lower grade, bulk tonnage mineralization extends as a
	halo from the veins into the surrounding shear zone. The main ore bodies vary in
	width from 80 to 120 feet and average 3.5 to 4.1 ounces of silver per ton in
	silver concentration.

	Reclamation of the Candelaria mine has been on-going for the

	re-seeded. Kinross completed re-contouring and re-seeding of the leach ponds in
	the first quarter of 2002. We have completed an environmental audit of the mine.
	This audit did not identify any significant environmental issues and confirmed
	that the substantial amount of reclamation work completed to date met all state

	The Carlin Trend is thought to mark a deep penetrating fault
	that separates relatively thick and stable continental crust to the east from a
	zone of thinned transitional crust to the west. The Maverick Springs Project is
	underlain primarily by Paleozoic marine
<B>
</B>
	sedimentary rocks that are
	unconformably overlain by basin-fill clastic sediments and Middle Tertiary
	volcanic tuffs. Gently folded and normal-faulted limestone and calcareous siltstone formations are the main host
	rocks to the silver-gold mineralization at the Maverick Springs Project. The
	disseminated mineralization does not outcrop; it occurs at depths of 500 feet to
	600 feet below surface and has been delineated by programs of reverse
	circulation and diamond core drilling. The mineralization trends north-northeast
	and occurs as a gently convex-shaped tabular body with length-width dimensions
	of approximately 8,000 feet and 2,500 feet, respectfully. In the vertical
	dimension the mineralized body attains a maximum thickness of about 200 feet.

	History
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Newmont was the first company to test the mineral potential of
	the Maverick Springs Property in the late 1990&#146;s, completing geological mapping,
	soil and stream sediment geochemical surveys as well as a substantial amount of
	drilling. A total of 130 drillholes were completed by Newmont, of which 37 were
	shallow conventional rotary or percussion holes, 39 were reverse circulation
	holes, and 54 were diamond core holes. Vista Gold and its Nevada based
	affiliate, VNC, then took over Newmont&#146;s purchase option agreement for the
	mineral rights to the property and conducted a wide-spaced seven-hole reverse
	circulation drilling program to test for continuation of the previously
	identified mineralized zone. In 2003 and 2004 respectively, Vista completed an
	additional 16 and 13 reverse circulation holes to further test the continuation
	of mineralization. In 2006, an 18-hole, 16,035 foot reverse circulation drill
	program encountered additional silver mineralization at the north end of the
	mineralized zone. In 2008, we assumed the role of operator under a joint venture
	with Vista Gold, whose 45% interest in the project is now controlled by Allied
	Nevada, and completed a 5 hole, 5,330 foot reverse circulation drilling program.
	Since the 2008 work program, we have not carried out any exploration activities
	on the property.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Veta Colorada Project is located a few kilometers northwest
	of the city of Parral in Chihuahua State, Mexico, approximately 210 kilometers
	south of Chihuahua City. Mining in the Parral mineral district commenced in the
	late 1500s when high-grade silver-gold mineralization was discovered in the
	Colorada vein, the principal mineralized structure in the district. For nearly
	four centuries, dozens of small mines intermittently exploited the Veta
	Colorada. The property of the Veta Colorada Project consists of nine mining
	concessions covering an area of approximately 4,244 hectares. The project can be
	accessed from paved Highway 24 that connects the Mexican cities of Hidalgo del
	Parraland Durango. In order to maintain our rights to these concessions we are
	required to pay surface mining taxes to the Mexican government.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The
<I>
	Veta Colorada
</I>
	vein structure is traceable for over
	10 kilometers, striking north-south and dipping moderately to the east. The base
	of this mineralized structure is represented by a planar fault that cuts through
	a sequence of Tertiary volcanic rocks a few hundred meters thick as well as
	significantly older marine sedimentary rocks that form the basement to the
	volcanics. Quartz veining, with textures that are typical of epithermal precious
	metal deposits, was deposited along sections of this major fault. The commonly
	banded and locally brecciated quartz veins attain thicknesses of one to four
	meters thick. The volcanic rocks in the immediate hanging wall of the veins are
	strongly fractured and locally brecciated, with quartz stocks and
	quartz-cemented breccias bodies extending up to 30 meters from the larger veins.
	Silver mineralization in the breccias bodies tends to be less concentrated than
	the vein-hosted mineralization and was generally left in place by previous
	miners.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Since acquiring the project, we have performed a limited amount
	of exploration work, including geological mapping, surface rock sampling, a
	limited amount of underground rock sampling and the diamond drilling of three
	boreholes for a combined length of 1,001 meters. This work was mainly done in
	2006; no exploration was done on the property in 2011.

	to be a narrow set of northwest trending fault structures in two known vein
	systems, both of which outcrop and can be identified by small historical
	diggings over a strike length of approximately 300 meters. Prior to our
	acquisition of the project Gold-Ore carried out regional stream sediment
	sampling, geological mapping, rock sampling and trenching and completed the

	7.97% Zn (DDH-214), in and around a breccia body to the north of the current

	Silver Standard is engaged in the exploration, development and
	production of silver-dominant mineral properties located in the Americas.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s strategic focus is to optimize production of
	silver from the Pirquitas mine and to advance other principal development and
	exploration projects, including Pitarrilla, San Luis, Diablillos and San
	Agustin. The Company has a large in-ground silver position and looks to exploit
	this for the benefit of the Company&#146;s shareholders. Certain projects also
	contain significant gold and base metals. The Company&#146;s future growth will be
	primarily driven through the development of core projects, while monetizing
	other non-core projects to support funding requirements.

	2011 was a volatile year for equity and financial markets
	globally. Significant sell-offs were evidenced in July and August as the U.S.
	sovereign debt downgrade was pending and the European sovereign debt situation
	worsened. Equity markets did recover somewhat and were led by the U.S. Dow Jones
	Index.

	Central banks around the world, including China and many
	European banks, acted in concert with the Americans to lower interest rates as
	the year progressed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This volatile economic environment has been supportive for the
	silver price and helped drive silver to a record high of $48.70 per ounce at the
	end of April before a sharp price reduction. Price increases through the summer
	saw the silver price back in the $40 per ounce range, but concerns over the
	world economic outlook in September resulted in prices declining to the low $30
	per ounce range. The silver price has been more stable since then and closed the
	year at $28.18 per ounce. Silver has maintained its status as a &#147;safe haven
	asset&#148; and a component of asset portfolios around the world.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company realized an average silver price of $33.58 per
	ounce on deliveries during 2011, compared to $20.92 per ounce in 2010.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The stronger price environment enabled the Company to increase
	revenues by 32% compared to 2010 despite sales volumes being lower, as a result
	of the Company terminating its long-term sales contract in the third quarter of
	2011.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Two significant events impacted Pirquitas during 2011. Firstly,
	the replacement time for delivery of the ball mill gearbox significantly
	impacted operations. The Company believes, however, that during the year
	significant progress was made improving the infrastructure, systems and
	processes for future operations at Pirquitas. The primary crushing capacity was
	increased and the ball mill refurbished. Cost initiatives have also been
	implemented to lower costs where possible and offset the risk of inflationary
	pressures. Despite the ball mill not being operational for over two months of
	the year, production of 7.1 million ounces of silver exceeded 2010 by 12%.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Secondly, a reduction to the estimated mineral reserves at
	Pirquitas has now been incorporated into the mine plan and shortened the mine
	life. However, this had no significant impact on the Company&#146;s financial results
	for 2011. In addition, the Company believes the exploration potential at
	Pirquitas is significant and has planned an extensive drilling program for 2012.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company concluded 2,000 tonnes of spot sales of silver
	concentrate during the fourth quarter of 2011 (of which 1,000 tonnes was
	delivered before the year-end), and announced on February 14, 2012 that it had
	committed an additional 6,000 tonnes of silver concentrate to various customers
	for delivery in the first half of 2012. In addition to the spot sales, trial
	shipments totaling 500 tonnes of silver concentrate are at various stages of
	evaluation with potential customers, and these trials are part of longer term
	contract negotiations. This committed tonnage goes a long way toward reducing
	the inventory which had accumulated during the year, and current deliveries are
	expected to be in a strong price environment.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company also completed significant transactions in the
	year; acquiring the remaining 30% interest in the San Luis project, monetizing
	the non-core Bowdens project for $70 million, and monetizing a significant
	amount of value from the investment in Pretium by selling approximately
	one-third for $130 million. The market value of the Company&#146;s investment in
	Pretium at the year-end was in excess of $300 million.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Exploration remains important for the Company and during 2011
	$36 million was spent, primarily at the development projects of Pitarrilla in
	Mexico and San Luis in Peru.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Through 2011 the Company accelerated the Pitarrilla project in
	Mexico. In the third quarter the Board of Directors committed significant funds
	for completion of a feasibility study by the middle of 2012, and for
	commencement of infrastructure construction, such as the operations camp, access
	roads and water wells. The Company has also been building the management team to
	advance this project.

	We entered production at our Pirquitas mine in Argentina
	on December 1, 2009. As a result, 2009 is our first year of reported

	historical jig tailings to prove the mechanical operation of the plant;
	since December 1, 2009, the tonnes milled were primarily oxide

	In 2011, the Company recorded total revenues from the Pirquitas
	Mine of $147.8 million from the sale of 4.8 million ounces of silver and 12.4
	million pounds of zinc. Shipments made in the period realized an average silver
	price of $33.58 per ounce, excluding the impact of period-end price adjustments,
	and zinc realized an average price of $1.02 per pound. This is compared with
	2010 which recorded revenues of $112.3 million from the sale of 5.9 million
	ounces of silver at an average realized price of $20.92, and 2009 which only
	recognised $5.4 million in revenue because commercial production only started in
	December of that year. There were no zinc sales in either 2010 or 2009. The
	increase in sales recognised compared to 2010 is reflective of the significant
	increase in the price of silver, partially offset by the lower volume sold in
	2011. Zinc sold in 2011 contributed $9.3 million to total revenues.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Since the mine&#146;s start-up, silver concentrates were sold
	pursuant to a sales contract to a single customer. The contract was terminated
	during the third quarter of 2011 which resulted in sales volumes of silver
	concentrate being lower than the prior year. Zinc concentrate sales were
	unaffected. A total of 1,000 tonnes of spot sales of silver concentrate were
	completed in the fourth quarter the Company has committed an additional 7,000
	tonnes for delivery in the first half of 2012. The Company is continuing
	negotiations to establish long-term contracts with various counterparties.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Cost of sales for 2011 was $95.9 million compared to $98.1
	million in 2010, and $7.9 million in 2009. This resulted in income from mine
	operations of $51.9 million in 2011, $14.1 million in 2010 and a loss of $2.5
	million in 2009. The net result was an improvement in margins from 2010 to 2011
	from 14.4% to 54.1% . Higher silver prices realized in 2011, and the
	commencement of zinc sales, fully offset the increase in unit costs that the
	mine experienced in the same period.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	General and administrative expenses for the year ended December
	31, 2011 were $23.7 million compared to $28.9 million in 2010 and $20.9 million
	in 2009. The main reason for the reduction between 2011 and 2010 was share-based
	payments that are revalued based on the Company&#146;s share price were significantly
	lower as the share price declined towards the end of 2011. Salaries and benefits
	were slightly higher in 2011 due to the increase in headcount as the Company
	expands its business. The increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due
	to growth in headcount and was mainly salary, employee benefit and bonus
	related, and the increase in stock price through 2010 also resulted in a
	significant increase in certain forms of share-based payments.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Expensed exploration costs of $5.7 million for 2011 and $2.4
	million in 2010, and $0.5 million in 2009 relate primarily to the drilling
	programs at the Pirquitas mine. Such costs at an operating property are expensed
	in line with the Company&#146;s accounting policy.

	In 2011 the Company recorded a gain on sale of mineral
	properties of $51.4 million from the sale of the Bowdens project in Australia,
	offset by $1.5 million of transaction costs related to the Snowfield and
	Brucejack disposition in 2010, for a net gain of $49.9 million. In 2010 the
	Company recognised a total gain of $402.0 million from the disposal of Snowfield
	and Brucejack, and the smaller Silvertip property.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In September 2011, the Company sold the Bowdens project in
	Australia to Kingsgate for $35.0 million in cash, 3.4 million shares of
	Kingsgate (with an approximate value of $25.6 million), and two deferred cash
	payments of A$5 million each. The first deferred payment was received on
	December 31, 2011 and the second is due on June 30, 2012. Total consideration
	was approximately $70.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $51.4 million
	(after tax gain of $35.3 million).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On December 21, 2010 the Company sold its 100% interest in the
	Snowfield and Brucejack properties located in British Columbia, Canada to
	Pretium for total consideration of $442.3 million. Under the terms of the
	transaction the Company received a total of 32.5 million common shares of
	Pretium with a fair value of $191.9 million, cash proceeds of $211.3 million
	(before costs of $12.4 million) and a non-interest bearing convertible promissory note in the principal
	amount of $39.1 million. This resulted in a gain of $388.8 million (after tax
	gain of $360.6 million).

	During February 2010, the Company sold its 100% interest in the
	Silvertip property located in British Columbia, Canada to Silvercorp Metals Inc.
	(&#147;Silvercorp&#148;). Under the terms of the agreement, Silvercorp paid consideration
	of $15.0 million, comprising cash of $7.1 million and 1.2 million common shares
	of Silvercorp with a fair value of $7.8 million, for an after-tax gain of $13.1
	million.

	On April 8, 2011 the Company sold 11.5 million units of Pretium
	for $120.1 million, before transaction costs. Each unit is comprised of one
	common share of Pretium and half of a warrant to purchase an additional common
	share of Pretium for C$12.50. This constituted a partial disposal of the
	investment in the equity accounted associate, and resulted in a gain of $38.8
	million. As at December 31, 2011 the Company retained an ownership interest of
	28.39% in Pretium, which had a book value of $136.3 million and a market value
	in excess of $300 million.

	The unrealized gain on financial instruments at fair value
	through profit and loss (&#147;FVTPL&#148;) is primarily from the convertible notes, for
	which a gain of $20.2 million was recorded in 2011 compared to a loss of $1.1
	million in 2010. This item was not recorded in 2009 as this instrument did not
	meet the definition of a derivative liability under Canadian GAAP. Since the
	acquisition of the Company&#146;s interest in Pretium in December 2010 the Company is
	required to record its share of Pretium&#146;s losses, which were $6.1 million in
	2011 and $0.1 million in 2010. The Company wrote off exploration costs of $4.5
	million following its decision to let its option of the Navidad claim group at
	the Nazas property expire. There were no significant cost write-offs in either
	2010 or 2009. The gain on marketable securities recognised in the income
	statement is the cumulative gain from the sale of marketable securities which
	has been recycled from other comprehensive income.

	The Company recorded a foreign exchange loss for the year ended
	December 31, 2011 of $2.7 million compared to a loss of $0.9 million in 2010 and
	a gain of $1.2 million in 2009. The Company&#146;s main exposure to foreign exchange
	risk is related to net monetary assets denominated in Canadian dollars and
	Argentine pesos. During 2011 the Canadian dollar was strong against the U.S.
	dollar during the first half of the year and weakened subsequently, while the
	Argentine peso steadily weakened against the U.S. dollar.

	In the year ended December 31, 2011 the Company recorded an
	income tax expense of $31.4 million compared to $32.2 million in 2010 and a
	recovery of $4.3 million in 2009. Of the total tax expense in 2011, $21.1 million reflects the current and deferred tax
	expense at Pirquitas, $5.2 million from the capital gain on the sale of the
	Pretium shares, $16.1 million from the gain on the sale of the Bowdens project;
	these expenses are partially offset by realized losses and the balance relates
	to changes in deferred tax liabilities. In 2010 the tax expense at Pirquitas was
	$5.5 million and there was an expense of $27.1 million in Canada primarily due
	to the sale of the Snowfield and Brucejack properties. The income tax recovery
	in 2009 was the result of unrealized losses on marketable securities and the
	operating loss at Pirquitas in that year.

	The Pirquitas mine commenced production at the end of 2009 and
	gradually increased production, and correspondingly, revenue through 2010 and
	into the first half of 2011. Silver prices also increased from the second half
	of 2010 through 2011. Lower revenues in the second half of 2011 were due to the
	termination of the sales contract while long-term contract negotiations were
	undertaken. Production continued through this period which resulted in a
	significant increase in finished goods inventory.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Income from mine operations follows the trend of revenues as a
	significant portion of operating costs are fixed and, although they increased on
	a unit basis through 2011, were broadly consistent. Net income of the Company
	has been impacted by non-routine transactions such as the sale of mineral
	properties in the fourth quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2011, and the
	partial sale of the Company&#146;s investment in Pretium in the second quarter of
	2011. In 2011 changes in fair value of the derivative liability has had an
	increasingly significant impact on net income with a gain in excess of $20.0

	third quarter. Compared to the prior quarter net income was impacted
	significantly by the following factors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In the fourth quarter of 2011 the Company recognised revenues
	of $14.4 million from the sale of 0.5 million ounces of silver and 1.9 million
	pounds of zinc, with realized silver prices of $33.42 per ounce, and $0.87 per
	pound of zinc. This compares to revenues of $26.2 million in the third quarter
	of 2011 from the sale of 0.7 million ounces of silver, and 3.9 million pounds of
	zinc, with realized silver price of $39.88 per ounce, and $1.01 per pound of zinc. In addition,
	negative final settlement prices and mark to market (&#147;MTM&#148;) adjustments reduced
	revenue compared to units delivered.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Cost of sales was higher in the fourth quarter because a higher
	proportion of operating costs were expensed during the period of plant downtime
	while not producing inventory, an increase in depreciation charges following the
	revised mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, and a write down of low
	grade stockpiles that are planned to be processed towards the end of the mine
	life. The increased costs generated a loss from mining operations in the fourth
	quarter.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	General and administrative costs in the fourth quarter were
	$3.3 million compared to $6.7 million in the third quarter. The reduction in the
	fourth quarter was due to lower expenses on share-based payments that are linked
	to the Company&#146;s share price which fell significantly in the fourth quarter.
	Severance expenses were also incurred in the third quarter.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The recognition of a gain of $51.4 million from the disposal of
	the Bowdens project in the third quarter materially increased net income and
	there were no significant dispositions or similar transactions in the fourth
	quarter.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Unrealised gains on financial instruments at FVTPL were $6.7
	million in the fourth quarter compared to $5.4 million in the third quarter due
	to the continued reduction in fair value of the conversion option of the
	convertible notes.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	An income tax recovery of $10.4 million was recorded in the
	fourth quarter compared to an expense of $30.9 million in the third quarter. The
	recovery in the fourth quarter was a result of the operating loss recorded at
	Pirquitas for the quarter as discussed above, the Company also realized a
	capital loss in Canada which sheltered gains from earlier in the year, and a
	reversal of deferred tax liabilities in Argentina. The significant tax expense
	in the third quarter was primarily driven by the taxable gain from the sale of
	the Bowdens project, operating income at Pirquitas and an increase in deferred
	tax liabilities.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Pirquitas mine produced 7.1 million ounces of silver during
	2011 compared with 6.3 million ounces in 2010. Although production was 12%
	higher than in 2010, 2011 production was negatively impacted by over two months
	of production downtime due to installing additional crushing capacity, and
	operating for most of the year with a damaged ball mill gearbox. The gearbox has
	now been completely rebuilt to nearly-new condition, and the mill recommenced
	operating in early November 2011. A spare gearbox from Europe is due to arrive
	in March 2012 and the Company has purchased a spare ball mill ring gear with
	expected delivery towards the end of 2012. Since the mill has been back in
	operation, it has exceeded design rates and production volumes have been strong.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Operations were also impacted by import restrictions imposed by
	the Argentine government on all industries, including mining. The restrictions
	make the timely sourcing of spare and replacement parts challenging as many
	necessary mining-related parts are not readily available at the required quality
	or specifications in Argentina. Import restrictions therefore result in lower
	equipment availability and additional maintenance costs. Most significantly
	impacted was the operation of the jig circuit. Loading, drilling and haulage
	equipment availabilities were also impacted.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the year, 1.1 million tonnes of ore were processed at an
	average milling rate of 2,983 tonnes per day, compared to 1.3 million tonnes at
	an average of 3,439 tonnes per day in 2010. The reduced tonnage processed during 2011 was due to the aforementioned ball mill
	shutdowns, however, the average milling rate during 2011 per operating day was
	in excess of 3,600 tonnes per day.

	Ore milled during 2011 contained an average silver grade of 253

	improvement compared to a silver grade of 233 g/t and recovery of 65.2% in 2010.
	The better silver recovery achieved during 2011 was due principally to
	improvements in the consistency of feed and continuous improvements to the
	crushing and flotation circuits.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The mine produced a total of 10.1 million pounds of zinc in

	During 2011 the Company adopted The Silver Institute&#146;s
	presentation guidance for production costs. This disclosure guidance differed
	from the Company&#146;s previous methodology; previous disclosures have therefore
	been restated to conform to the amended presentation.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Direct mining costs in 2011 were $13.65 per ounce of silver
	compared to $12.19 per ounce in 2010. The increase in unit cost in 2011 versus
	2010 was primarily driven by inflationary pressures on local labour costs and
	catering, repairs and maintenance costs related to the primary crusher and the
	refurbishment of the ball mill gearbox, additional maintenance costs and
	external costs associated with the import restrictions, and expenditures
	incurred to improve the long-term production efficiency of the facility.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Total cash cost in 2011, which includes by-product credits,
	treatment and refining costs, royalties and production taxes, was $20.93 per
	ounce of silver compared to $18.03 per ounce of silver in 2010. Treatment and
	refining costs, as well as royalties and production taxes all vary as a function
	of sales prices and are recorded for the actual ounces of silver sold.
	Consequently, on a per ounce basis, the variability in total cash cost from
	period to period is partially due to sales prices and the difference between
	production and sales volumes. The higher incremental per ounce impact of these
	costs in 2011 compared with 2010 is due primarily to higher prices achieved for
	sales in the current year.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Total production cost, which includes depreciation and
	amortization, was $25.37 per ounce in 2011 compared to $22.14 in 2010. The
	depreciation and amortization costs are largely similar on a per ounce basis,
	although these costs were impacted in the fourth quarter of 2011 following the
	reduction of mineral reserves at Pirquitas which increased the depreciation
	charges on certain assets.

	In addition to the comprehensive in-fill drilling program that
	was completed in 2011 in the area of the San Miguel open-pit, the Company
	diamond drilled 1,837 meters at an exploration target located just 200 meters
	north of the pit in the Cortaderas Valley. The main target at Cortaderas
	consists of a steeply-plunging breccia body where the breccia matrix is composed
	of silver-bearing iron and zinc sulphide mineralization and sulfide-rich,
	vein-hosted mineralization was intersected by drill-holes in the vicinity of the
	above-mentioned breccia body. To date, nine relatively closely-spaced
	drill-holes have intersected the mineralized breccia body. The results from this
	drilling were encouraging and based on the drilling completed, the Company
	estimated an Inferred Mineral Resource for the breccia of 7.0 million tonnes
	averaging 98.4 g/t silver and 2.3% zinc, for approximately 22.5 million ounces
	of contained silver and 360.1 million pounds of contained zinc, at a 50 g/t

	Fiscal stability agreement and regulatory environment
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Pirquitas mine has a fiscal stability agreement with the
	government of Argentina dating from 1998. In 2002, the government of Argentina
	implemented an export duty on concentrates that did not apply to companies with
	pre-existing fiscal stability agreements. In December 2007 the National Customs
	Authority of Argentina levied an export duty of approximately 10% from
	concentrates for projects with fiscal stability agreements pre-dating 2002. The
	Company has been advised that Pirquitas is subject to this export duty despite
	contrary rights detailed under the 1998 fiscal stability agreement. The legality
	of the export duty applied to silver concentrates has been challenged and is
	currently under review by the court in Argentina. In July 2010, the Company
	filed a claim in the provincial court for repayment of export duties paid on
	silver concentrates, and for an order to cease payment of the export duty until
	the matter has been decided by the court. An order was granted effective
	September 29, 2010 to cease payment of the export duty on silver concentrates
	pending the decision of the courts, and in April 2011 a government appeal
	against this order was denied.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As of December 31, 2011 the Pirquitas mine has paid $6.6
	million in export duties against which it has filed for recovery. In accordance
	with the order to cease payment the Company has not been paying export duties on
	silver concentrate but continues to accrue duties in full until the outcome of
	the claim is known with certainty. At December 31, 2011, the Company had accrued
	a liability totaling $13.1 million, with a corresponding impact on cost of sales
	in the relevant period. If this export duty is successfully overturned the
	benefit will be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the full
	amount of paid and unpaid duty in the period recovery becomes virtually certain.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	On October 26, 2011 the Argentina government announced a decree
	that requires all funds from mining export sales to be repatriated to Argentina
	and converted into Argentina Pesos within the Sole Foreign Exchange Market in
	Argentina, and each transfer is subject to a 0.6% transfer tax. The mining
	industry had previously been exempted from this tax. Although the aforementioned
	fiscal stability agreement also includes stability over foreign exchange
	controls, the government removed such benefits with this decree. The Company
	will comply with all laws and regulations, and is monitoring the situation
	closely. The impact of the transfer tax should not have a material impact on the
	Company.

	During the year, mineral prospecting on the property resulted
	in the discovery of a set of northwesterly trending quartz veins which were
	tested for their precious metal content with the collection of 265 rock-chip
	samples. Assay results for these samples indicate sections of these veins are
	significantly mineralized with gold and require further assessment by diamond
	drilling. In addition, the Company contracted an external consultant to examine
	and assess the potential of the BP Zone. This zone of widespread hydrothermal
	alteration and base metal mineralization is centered about 4 kilometers
	southwest of the Ayelen vein-hosted gold-silver deposit. It was concluded that
	the alteration and mineralization found at the BP Zone is most likely related to
	a porphyry intrusion and warrants additional drill-testing. Exploration programs

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Nazas, which until recently comprised three contiguous mineral

	gold- and silver-bearing quartz veins and related hydrothermal alteration.
	Several of these vein targets have now been tested, with approximately 12,587
	meters being drilled from 22 boreholes during 2011. Early in the campaign,
	drill-holes intersected gold mineralization in epithermal quartz veining that
	prompted the addition of seven holes to the original program.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the fourth quarter of 2011 however, the Company elected
	not to continue its option to purchase the Navidad claim group at the center of
	the Nazas project area and expensed previously capitalized exploration costs of
	$4.5 million. Although mineralization was encountered, assay results were
	inadequate to justify the high costs to maintain the option. Notwithstanding the
	decision on the Navidad claim group, the geological information provided by this
	year&#146;s drilling campaign will be utilized in the planning of future drilling on
	the other two Nazas properties. The goal at Nazas continues to be the discovery

	Critical Accounting Estimates
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as
	well as revenues and expenses.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
<U>
	Review of asset carrying values and impairment
	assessment
</U>
</I>
	In accordance with the Company&#146;s accounting policy each asset
	or cash generating unit is evaluated every reporting period to determine whether
	there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, a formal
	estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment loss is recognized
	to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The
	recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating group of assets is measured at
	the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The determination of fair value and value in use requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected production, sales volumes, commodity prices, reserves, operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditures. The estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there is the possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances some or all of the carrying value of the assets may be further impaired or the impairment charge reduced with the impact recorded in the income statement.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
<U>
	Determination of mineral reserve and mineral resource
	estimates
</U>
</I>
	The Company estimates its mineral reserves and mineral
	resources based on information compiled by qualified persons as defined by NI
	43-101. Reserves determined in this way are used in the calculation of
	depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, and for forecasting the
	timing of the payment of close down and restoration costs. In assessing the life
	of a mine for accounting purposes, mineral resources are only taken into account
	where there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction. There are
	numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves, and assumptions
	that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new
	information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities,
	exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic
	status of reserves and may, ultimately, result in reserve estimates being
	revised. Such changes in reserves could impact on depreciation and amortization
	rates, asset carrying values and provisions for close down and restoration
	costs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the year ended December 31, 2011 the Company presented
	an updated mineral reserve and mineral resource at its Pirquitas mine in
	Argentina, this will increase depletion and depreciation charges in future
	periods by reducing the life of mine and expected tonnes of production.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
<U>
	Determination of useful lives of property, plant and
	equipment
</U>
</I>
	The Company uses the units of production method to depreciate
	mineral property expenditure, whereby depreciation is calculated using the
	tonnage of ore extracted from the mine in the period as a percentage of the
	total tonnage of ore expected to be extracted in current and future periods
	based on proven and probable reserves. As noted above there are numerous
	uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves which are fundamental to this
	calculation.

	Valuation of inventory
</U>
</I>
	Stockpiled ore, work in
	process and finished goods are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable
	value (&#147;NRV&#148;). NRV is calculated as the estimated price at the time of sale
	based on prevailing and future metal prices less estimated future production
	costs to convert the inventory into saleable form and all associated selling
	costs. The determination of both estimated future sales price and production
	costs requires significant assumptions that may significantly impact the stated
	value of the Company&#146;s inventory.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
<U>
	Close down and restoration provisions
</U>
</I>
	Close down
	and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining, and the majority of
	close down and restoration expenditures are incurred near the end of the life of
	the mine. The Company&#146;s accounting policy requires the recognition of such
	provisions when the obligation occurs. The initial provisions are periodically
	reviewed during the life of the operation to reflect known developments, e.g.
	updated cost estimates and revisions to the estimated lives of operations.
	Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Company estimates
	its costs based on studies using current restoration standards and techniques.
	The initial closure provisions together with changes, other than those arising
	from the unwind of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of
	the provision, are capitalized within property plant and equipment and
	depreciated over the lives of the assets to which they relate.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The ultimate magnitude of these costs is uncertain, and cost
	estimates can vary in response to many factors including changes to the relevant
	legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or experience on
	other mine sites. The expected timing of expenditure can also change, for
	example in response to changes in ore reserves or production rates or economic
	conditions. As a result there could be significant adjustments to the provision
	for close down and restoration, which would affect future financial results.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2011,
	the Company recorded a change in its estimate for close down and restoration
	from the preliminary findings of a mine closure plan for its Pirquitas mine in
	Argentina, that is scheduled for completion in 2012. The estimate increased by
	$33.8 million, and this was a prospective change that no impact on the
	Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. There is
	considerable measurement uncertainty with a provision of this nature from the
	timing of cash flows, inflationary environment and impact of exchange rates. The
	final obligation could vary materially from that presented which would impact
	future results.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
<U>
	Determination of the fair value of share-based
	compensation
</U>
</I>
	The fair value of stock options and other forms of
	share-based compensation granted is computed to determine the relevant charge to
	the income statement, and liability if applicable. In order to compute this fair
	value the Company uses different option pricing models that inherently require
	management to make various estimates and assumptions in relation to the expected
	life of the award, expected volatility, risk-free rate and forfeiture rates.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
<U>
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities
</U>
</I>
	The
	determination of the Company&#146;s tax expense for the period and deferred tax
	assets and liabilities involves significant estimation and judgment by
	management. In determining these amounts, management interprets tax legislation
	in a variety of jurisdictions and makes estimates of the expected timing of the
	reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Management also makes estimates
	of future earnings which affect the extent to which potential future tax
	benefits may be used. The Company is subject to assessments by various taxation
	authorities, which may interpret legislation differently. These differences may
	affect the final amount or the timing of the payment of taxes. The Company
	provides for such differences, where known, based on management&#146;s best estimate
	of the probable outcome of these matters.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of potential foreign tax credits that may be used to offset taxes paid in Argentina. These have not been recognised due to measurement uncertainty over the extent and timing of any potential benefit. If recognized this will create a recovery of income tax expense in that period.

	new mixed measurement model having only two categories: amortized cost and

	through other comprehensive income, dividends are recognised in profit or loss
	to the extent not clearly representing a return of investment; however, other
	gains and losses (including impairments) associated with such instruments remain

	IFRS 11 requires a venturer to classify its interest in a

	is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have
	rights to the assets and the obligations for the liabilities. A joint
	venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control
	of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The
	determination whether a joint arrangement constitutes a joint operation or
	a joint venture is based on the parties&#146; rights and responsibilities under
	the arrangement and thus the existence of a separate legal vehicle is no
	longer the main factor in making such determination. Joint ventures will
	be accounted for using the equity method of accounting thereby eliminating
	the option available under existing IFRS to use either the proportionate
	consolidation method or the equity method. Joint operations are accounted
	for by a venturer by recognizing its share of the assets, liabilities,
	revenues and expenses of the joint operation. The Company has not yet

	subsequent periods and items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss in
	subsequent periods. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on
	or after July 1, 2012, with full retrospective application. The Company has not
	yet assessed the impact of the standard or determined whether it will adopt the

	In October 2011 the IASB issued IFRIC 20
<I>
	Stripping Costs in
	the Production Phase of a Surface Mine
</I>
	(&#147;IFRIC 20&#148;). This interpretation provides guidance on the
	accounting for the costs of stripping activity in the production phase when two
	benefits accrue to the entity: usable ore that can be used to produce inventory
	and improved access to further quantities of material that will be mined in
	future periods. IFRIC 20 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after
	January 1, 2013 with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet assessed
	the impact of the standard or determined whether it will adopt the standard
	early.

	The non-GAAP financial measures presented do not have any

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company uses the non-GAAP measures of direct mining cost,
	total cash cost and total production cost per ounce of silver to manage and
	evaluate operating performance. The Company believes that, in addition to
	conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors use
	this information to evaluate the Company&#146;s performance and ability to generate
	cash flows. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and
	should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
	performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This classification is based upon The Silver Institute&#146;s
	production cost standard as endorsed on June 16, 2011. Previous to this date
	there was no standardized presentation guidance and the Company reported cash
	production cost, cash operating cost and total production cost, and moved to The
	Silver Institute&#146;s production cost standard in its disclosures in 2011 in order
	to facilitate more uniform disclosures within the industry. All comparatives
	have been updated to reflect the current presentation standard.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following table provides a reconciliation of direct mining
	costs, total cash costs and total production costs to cost of sales, as reported
	in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Income:

	Financial Instruments and Related Risks
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks as a
	result of its operations, including market risk (which includes price risk,
	currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The
	Company&#146;s overall risk management strategy seeks to reduce potential adverse
	effects on the Company&#146;s financial performance. Risk management is carried out
	under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company may, from time to time, use foreign exchange
	contracts, commodity price contracts and interest rate swaps to manage its
	exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange, metal prices and interest rates.
	The Company does not have a practice of trading derivatives. In the past, the
	Company&#146;s use of derivatives was limited to specific programs to manage
	fluctuations in foreign exchange risk, which are subject to the oversight of the
	Board of Directors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The risks associated with the Company&#146;s financial instruments,
	and the policies on how the Company mitigates those risks are set out below.
	This does not constitute a fulsome discussion of all risks facing the
	Company.

<U>
	Credit Risk
</U>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to
	discharge its obligations under the terms of a financial contract. The Company&#146;s
	credit risk is limited to the collectability of trade receivables in the
	ordinary course of business and the quality of its financial investments.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
<U>
	Credit risk related to financial institutions and cash
	deposits
</U>
</I>
	The Company&#146;s policy is only to utilize highly-rated financial
	institutions and only to invest in government securities. The Company considers
	the risk of loss associated with cash deposits to be low.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
<U>
	Credit risk related to trade receivables
</U>
</I>
	The
	Company is subject to significant concentrations of credit risk related to trade
	receivables because almost all of its sales through 2011 were to a single
	customer. The Company has not, however, recorded an allowance against trade
	receivables because it is confident of the collectability based on the nature of
	its customer and all balances owed have been settled in full when due. In order
	to mitigate this risk, the Company ensures a minimum creditworthiness of
	customers, and has entered into spot sales agreements with additional customers
	in 2012.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
<U>
	Credit risk related to other financial assets
</U>
</I>
	All
	other receivable balances are expected to be collectible in full due to the
	nature of the counterparties and/or a previous history of collectability.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company also has credit risk through its significant value
	added tax balance that is collectible from the government of Argentina. Due to
	the legislative rules and complex collection process the asset has been
	classified as non-current. The Company believes that this balance is collectible
	in full.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to
	meet its obligations over financial instruments as they fall due. The Company
	manages its liquidity risk through a rigorous planning and budgeting process,
	which is reviewed and updated on a regular basis, to help determine the funding
	requirements to support the Company&#146;s current operations, expansion and
	development plans, and by managing its capital structure. The Company&#146;s
	objective is to ensure that there are sufficient committed financial resources
	to meet its business requirements for a minimum of twelve months.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In the opinion of management, working capital at December 31,
	2011 together with future cash flows from operations is sufficient to support
	the Company&#146;s commitments through 2012. For periods beyond 2012 the current
	working capital and cash flows from operations are expected to support further
	development, exploration and growth.

	At December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately $329.1
	million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $96.7 million from December
	31, 2010. This cash is considered sufficient to meet the Company&#146;s working
	capital requirements and debt obligations.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In addition to the cash and cash equivalents, at December 31,
	2011 the Company had positive working capital of $70.0 million, comprised of
	$33.5 million in marketable securities and inventory of $94.7 million, offset by
	current liabilities of $77.6 million. The high finished goods inventory balance
	of $44.5 million at year end was due to the lower level of sales in the second
	half of 2011 while new long-term sales contracts were being negotiated; this is
	expected to be sold in the first half of 2012. Current liabilities constitute
	taxes payable of $22.5 million, and other payables and accrued liabilities in
	the normal course of business.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	At December 31, 2011 the Company also owned 24.7 million shares

	February 29, 2012 the market value of the Pretium holding has risen further, to
	in excess of $400 million.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s liquidity position improved compared to the prior
	year end due to net cash inflows of $96.7 million, for total cash and cash
	equivalents at December 31, 2011 of $329.1 million. Of this $322.7 million is
	held in Canada and the United States.

	The cash inflows during the year were largely the result of the

<I>
	Compensation Philosophy and Principles
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company recognizes that people are our primary asset and
	our principal source of competitive advantage. The success of the Company
<B>
</B>
	depends upon a group of highly qualified and motivated executives dedicated
	to the consistent operation and strong long-term performance of the Company.
	Highly skilled and motivated executives greatly enhance the Company&#146;s ability to
	produce superior results for its shareholders and to be a leader in its
	industry. In 2010, the Company adopted an Executive Compensation Philosophy, the
	purpose of which is to detail the Company&#146;s goals, principles and limitations in
	regard to executive compensation. This philosophy is intended to guide the
	Company in establishing a foundation for executive compensation decisions.
	Executive compensation at the Company is performance-based, driven by the
	achievements of the individual and the Company.
<I>
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The goal for the Company&#146;s executive compensation program is to
	provide a total compensation package that is competitive in the industry,
	flexible, and attracts, motivates and retains experienced and qualified
	executive leadership. The mining industry is experiencing a very competitive
	labour market and this situation is expected to continue for the foreseeable
	future as the talent pool ages and the supply of experienced talent continues to
	decline. As the Company expands the number of operating mines in its portfolio,
	the necessary experienced talent will be drawn primarily from mid-tier and
	senior producer companies within the mining industry.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In order to accomplish its goals and to ensure that the
	Company&#146;s executive compensation program is consistent with its stated mission
	and strategy, the Board of Directors has approved the following philosophy
	statements: (1) The Company will provide a competitive and flexible compensation
	program for its senior executives that will attract, motivate and retain the
	highly qualified individuals necessary to grow our business. Our desire is to
	motivate employees to achieve higher levels of performance and to appropriately
	reward those employees for their efforts; and (2) Compensation programs will
	emphasize a &#147;pay-for-performance&#148; system, in which an individual&#146;s long-term
	compensation and career advancement are dependent upon both individual and
	Company performance, with an objective of increasing long-term shareholder
	value. If the individual or the Company does not meet its objectives, awards
	will be adjusted in accordance with pre-established metrics and formulae.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	There are four components to the Company&#146;s
	&#147;pay-for-performance&#148; system: base salary; short-term incentive compensation;
	long-term incentive compensation; and non-cash compensation.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Base Salary.
</B>
	Annual base salary must be considered in
	the context of the total compensation package. Generally, we will target to be
	competitive within our defined peer group (discussed below) and market place
	where we compete for talent. Salaries are reviewed annually and base salaries
	may be adjusted based on changes within the competitive market of our peer
	group, an individual&#146;s evaluated performance and his or her direct manager&#146;s
	assessment.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Short-term Incentive.
</B>
	The objective of the short-term
	incentive program at the Company is to put variable pay at risk, motivate the
	executive to achieve pre-determined objectives and provide a means to reward
	achievement of the annual business plan. The short-term incentive plan is based
	on the achievement of both corporate and individual goals. Corporate goals are
	derived from the Company&#146;s annual business plan and are typically 5 &#150; 7 in
	number. Bonuses are scaled depending on actual performance compared to the
	expected performance set out in the Company&#146;s business plan. The CEO develops
	individual goals for each member of the senior management team. Individual goals
	for the CEO are developed by the Board of Directors. We continue to strive to
	provide superior compensation for employees who deliver superior results. The
	CEO and the Compensation Committee also retain the right to exercise discretion
	when making incentive compensation recommendations to the Board to reflect
	extraordinary events and or market conditions.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Long-Term Incentive (&#147;LTI&#148;).
</B>
	The objective of the LTI
	program is to ensure the appropriate level of long-term reward/risk to motivate
	executive performance and provide retention of senior management. Prior to 2010,
	our LTI program consisted of only Company stock options. In 2010, our Board of
	Directors approved a new LTI program, which was introduced in January 2011. The
	new LTI program for our executive participants includes Performance Share Units
	(&#147;PSUs&#148;) in addition to stock options. The PSUs are intended to bring better
	alignment of executive risk/rewards measured by total returns to the Company&#146;s
	shareholders relative to our defined peer group. Under the LTI plan, executive
	participants will be eligible for PSU grants on an annual basis, subject to
	Board approval. The PSUs will have a three year cliff-vesting period, and the
	potential payout at the end of the period will range from 0 to 200% of the
	initial grant, depending on results. The payout will be based on a &#147;Total
	Shareholder Return&#148; (&#147;TSR&#148;) calculation at the end of the three year vesting
	period, in comparison to the TSR of our defined peer group. The peer group has
	been established by the Board of Directors and will be reviewed annually for
	continued appropriateness. Our goal continues to be motivation of our executives
	for the long-term by balancing appropriate reward / risk for both the individual
	and the Company.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The criteria for choosing the comparator group is as follows:
	(a) companies in the precious metals segment, with similar revenue, market
	capitalization, operations and projects (b) companies that reflect our
	competition for investment dollars.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In 2011 our TSR Comparator group included Alamos Gold Inc.;
	Allied Nevada Gold Corp.; AuRico Gold Inc.; Compania de Minas Buenaventura;
	Centamin Egypt Ltd.; Coeur d&#146;Alene Mines Corporation; European Goldfields;
	Fresnillo plc; Golden Star Resources Inc.; Hecla Mining Company; Hochschild
	Mining; Iamgold Corporation; Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.; New Gold Inc.; Northgate
	Minerals; Novagold Resources Inc.; Minefinders; Pan American Silver Corp.; the
	Silver Price; Silver Wheaton Corp. and Silvercorp Metals Inc.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Board reviews the TSR Comparator Group on an annual basis
	and adjusts the group based on continued applicability and mergers and
	acquisitions in the market place.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In 2012, we have adjusted our TSR Comparator Group to include:
	Alexco Resource Corp.; Endeavour Silver Corp.; First Majestic Silver Corp.;
	Fortuna Silver Mines Inc.; and International Minerals Corp.; based on the
	criteria listed above, and our desire to increase the size of our comparator
	group. We have removed from the TSR Comparator Group European Goldfields and
	Northgate Minerals (due to acquisitions) and Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. This adjusted
	TSR Comparator Group will be used to calculate the value of PSUs which were
	granted January, 2012.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under the Company&#146;s Stock Option Plan, grants are made annually
	at the market price of the underlying stock and the options vest one-third
	annually on the first, second and third anniversaries of grant. The Board
	currently grants stock options with a term of seven years.

	Base Salary
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The base salary of our Named Executive Officers is designed to
	attract and retain individuals who can contribute to our growth as an operating
	mining company. During the last several years, competition among resource
	companies for skilled executives has been intense and the base salaries of
	recently hired Named Executive Officers have been established through
	negotiation in the market place. Base salaries are reviewed annually to reflect
	performance and market conditions if appropriate. For 2012, base salaries for
	each Named Executive Officer were reviewed by our Compensation Committee and
	changes were approved by the independent members of the Board, in consultation
	with our CEO and based on discussion, analysis and review of compensation data
	provided by the Hay Group on our peer group of companies and the PwC Canadian
	mining survey of base salaries. In 2010, our Compensation Committee established
	and reviewed our peer group of companies, against which to benchmark the base
	salaries of our Named Executive Officers. The selection of our peer group was
	based on two principal criteria; (1) Companies that are similar to Silver
	Standard in terms of roles, operations, locations, staff levels, projects etc.;
	and (2) Companies which are a potential source of executive talent. The peer
	group for 2012 includes Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd., Aurico, First Majestic Silver
	Corp., GoldCorp., NovaGold, Teck Resources, Yamana Gold, IAMGOLD Corp.,
	Fresnillo Mining, QuadraFNX Mining Ltd., Centerra Gold Inc., Eldorado Gold
	Corp., HudBay Minerals Inc., Pan American Silver Corp., Thompson Creek Metals
	Co. Inc., Stillwater Mining Co., New Gold Inc., Coeur d&#146; Alene Mines Corp.,
	Golden Star Resources Ltd., Hecla Mining Co., Eastern Platinum Ltd., European
	Goldfields Ltd., Ivanhoe Mining Ltd., and Lundin Mining. The Company will
	continue to monitor relevant market data and our peer group, to ensure
	competitiveness of our base salaries for Named Executive Officers in the
	marketplace.

	Short Term Incentive Award
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Short-term incentive awards are used to reward Named Executive
	Officers for their performance during the year and to incentivize such
	individuals for the following year. The awards are comprised of cash bonuses in
	amounts determined by the Compensation Committee, in consultation with our CEO,
	and approved by the Board. The target annual short term incentive award ranges
	from 50% to 100% of base salary (actual payouts can range from 0 to 200% of
	target) for each Named Executive Officer. Cash bonuses were awarded to our Named
	Executive Officers, based on the Company&#146;s achievement of corporate objectives
	as well as achievement of their own personal objectives that were established at
	the start of the year, as determined by our CEO and the Compensation Committee
	and approved by the board. For the Named Executive Officers, the short term
	incentive awards are weighted 70% for corporate objectives and 30% for personal
	objectives.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s corporate targets for 2011 were measured and
	based on the following factors: production of ounces of silver at the Pirquitas
	Mine; operating costs; operating cash flow; completion of feasibility studies
	for some of our mineral projects; exploration reserves increase; reduction of
	&#147;High Potential Incidents&#148; (&#147;HPI&#148;) across the Company; and a reduction in
	environmental and community relations incidents. In 2011, it was determined that
	the Company achieved 45% of its corporate objectives. The Company overachieved
	on its HPI objective, achieved its exploration and community relations targets,
	but did not achieve expectations on production, operating cost, feasibility
	studies and environmental objectives.

	Individual Performance for Named Executive Officers
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For the Named Executive Officers, the individual performance
	component is weighted at 30% of the bonus potential, except for Matthew Freeman
	whose performance component is weighted at 50%, with the ability to over achieve
	based on accomplishments of the individual (described below). For 2011 the
	Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that discretion be applied to
	awards for the individual performance component of our plan to reflect the
	significant effort of our Named Executive Officers in addressing unique
	operating circumstances and to build the Company foundation for future growth,
	irrespective of the short-term impact on financial results. The Compensation
	Committee did not alter our plan with respect to the corporate performance
	component.

	John Smith &#150; President and Chief Executive Officer is evaluated

	Significant progress was made in recruiting executives and technical teams as

	future. He also pursued alternative strategic options for several projects in
	our development pipeline.

	John W.

	Matthew Freeman, Interim Chief Financial Officer, exceeded

	Standard directing the preparation of monthly, quarterly and year-end financial
	reports as well as leading our annual budgeting process. It should be noted that

	For 2011, the Compensation Committee monitored and made
	improvements to the short-term incentive award program that sets objective and
	subjective corporate performance goals and personal performance goals for all
	Named Executive Officers. These improvements focused on timing of the objective
	setting process. Annual performance objectives are established through
	consultation amongst the CEO, Named Executive Officers and the Compensation
	Committee, for final approval by the Board. The Compensation Committee will also
	review personal objectives for the CEO and recommend them to the Board of
	Directors for approval.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<I>
	Long Term Incentive Awards
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Our Long-Term Incentive program utilizes both Stock Options and
	PSUs. Stock Options are used to retain our Named Executive Officers while
	aligning their interest with those of our shareholders by providing incentive to
	grow the Company and increase the wealth of our shareholders, through an
	increase in our share price. The vesting schedule for our stock options is
	currently as follows: 1/3 of options granted vest one year after the date of
	grant; 1/3 of options vest two years after the date of grant; and the final 1/3
	of options vest three years after the date of grant. The term for exercising
	stock options is seven years.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In January 2011, stock options and PSUs were granted to our
	Named Executive Officers with the exception of Mr. Freeman. The number of
	options granted to each Named Executive Officer was reviewed by the Compensation
	Committee and approved by the Board, in consultation with our CEO. The
	Compensation Committee recommended the grant of options after discussion taking
	into account individual performance, targets under our approach to LTI,
	participant&#146;s ability to contribute to our long term growth and the need to
	retain our Named Executive Officers. Based on this discussion and our plan
	design, Named Executive Officer participants were granted options valued from
	50% to 100% of their base salaries.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Target Milestone for the PSUs granted is based on the TSR
	of Silver Standard over the Performance Period compared with the TSR of our
	comparator group of companies set forth above (the &#147;Comparator Companies&#148;) over
	the same time period. The Compensation Committee may revise the Comparator
	Companies, as appropriate from time to time and did so in 2012 for the reasons
	discussed above.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As soon as reasonably practicable following the end of the
	Performance Period (and in any event not later than 30 days following the end of
	the Performance Period), the Committee will determine the Company&#146;s TSR
	performance and assign a percentage from 0 &#150; 200% reflecting such performance as

	Subject to the PSU Plan, the number of PSUs granted vest in

	PSUs granted to such Designated Participant multiplied by the Performance
	Percentage. The formula for granting PSUs to the Named Executive Officers&#146; is a
	target award of from 50% to 100% of base salary (50% for Vice Presidents, 75%
	for Senior Vice Presidents and 100% for the CEO) divided by the 5 day Volume
	Weighted Average Price (&#147;VWAP&#148;) prior to the date of the award.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The PSUs will also vest in the event of a termination upon a
	change of control. If the termination date is on or after the date which is one
	half way through the applicable performance period, all unvested PSUs are deemed
	to be vested PSUs based on an assumed performance percentage of 100% and shall
	be redeemed at a cash amount equal to the market value of the shares at the
	termination date. If the termination date is before the date which is one-half
	way through the Performance Period applicable to the PSUs held, all unvested
	PSUs shall immediately be deemed to be Vested PSUs as of the termination date
	based on an assumed Performance Percentage of 100 per cent and the Company shall
	redeem such vested PSUs by paying, as of the redemption date, a cash amount
	calculated by multiplying the Market Value of such vested PSUs as of the
	termination date by the proportion of the Performance Period which has elapsed
	as of the termination date. In the event of a Change of Control where an
	acquiror of the Company does not agree to assume all of the obligations of the
	Company under the PSU Plan, or the Committee determines that such assumption is
	not consistent with the objectives of the PSU Plan, all unvested PSUs held shall
	immediately be deemed to be vested PSUs as of the effective date of the Change
	of Control based on an assumed Performance Percentage of (a) 100 per cent or (b)
	any percentage specifically determined by the Committee for this purpose and the
	Company shall redeem such vested PSUs by paying to each Designated Participant,
	as of the Redemption Date, a cash amount equal to such vested PSUs calculated by

	A PSU transition grant was granted to the Named Executive
	Officer&#146;s on January 27, 2011. The PSU transition grant value was
	determined by using 100% of the Named Executive Officers&#146; salary, divided
	by the greater of the closing price preceding the award date and the 5 day
	VWAP share price prior to the award date (C$23.14) to establish the number
	of PSUs to be granted (rounded to the nearest hundred). The performance
	period for transition PSU grant is January 4, 2011 to December 31, 2012,
	please refer to &#147;Long Term Incentive Awards&#148; for details of the PSU Plan
	and Target Shareholder Return milestones. For accounting purposes, we
	selected the Monte Carlo model for valuation for disclosure of the fair
	value. As at the start of the performance period, January 4, 2011 the
	Monte Carlo valuation for the PSU was $31.00 per PSU. As at December 31,
	2011, the Monte Carlo valuation for the PSU was $6.95 for the two year
	performance period. Mr. J. Smith received 27,100 Transition PSUs, Mr. Yip
	received 12,000 Transition PSUs, Mr. DeCooman received 9,800 Transition
	PSU and Mr. D. Smith received 9,800 Transition PSUs. Mr. Phillips was not
	employed in the capacity of Senior Vice President Operations and

	Restricted Share Units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) were granted on March 9,

	The following discussion applies to our Named Executive

	not have an executive employment agreement with the Company.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We have entered into employment agreements with each of our
	Named Executive Officers, except for Mr. Freeman who was appointed interim Chief
	Financial Officer in 2011. Under the terms of the employment agreements, these
	Named Executive Officers are entitled to compensation, based on their
	remuneration at the time, in the event of termination without cause and on a
	termination without cause or for good reason, within 12 months of a change of
	control of the Company. No Named Executive Officer is entitled to compensation
	on resignation, retirement or termination for cause. A change of control, in general, occurs when a person or group of persons acting
	together through a transaction or series of transactions beneficially acquire or
	exercise control or direction over 25% or more of our common shares. Any such
	compensation payable to a Named Executive Officer is required to be paid to him
	within 30 days of the termination of the Named Executive Officer&#146;s employment.
	The events selected for triggering payment in connection with termination
	without cause and on a change of control were determined by the Compensation
	Committee, with advice from independent consultants, based on industry standards
	at the time the agreements were entered into with the Named Executive Officers.

	Our Board of Directors adopted a deferred share unit (&#147;DSU&#148;)
	plan effective July 1, 2008 to more closely align the interests of our directors
	with the interests of our shareholders. With the adoption of the DSU plan, our
	directors will no longer receive option awards. Under our DSU plan: (a)
	directors are awarded annual DSU grants and directors may elect to receive all
	or a portion of their annual retainer fees in DSUs, (b) the number of DSUs to be
	received is calculated by dividing the dollar value of the DSUs to be received
	by the market price of our common shares on the date the DSUs are credited to a
	director&#146;s account, (c) DSUs are credited to a director&#146;s account pro rata on a
	quarterly basis and (d) DSUs cannot be redeemed until the director ceases to be
	a member of the Board of Directors. Upon redemption of DSUs, we will pay to a
	director a lump sum cash amount equal to the aggregate number of DSUs that have
	been credited to the account of that director multiplied by the market price of
	our common shares at the time of redemption.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Directors are awarded an annual DSU amount equivalent to
	C$60,000 and the Chairman C$120,000 paid quarterly. The following table provides
	a breakdown of fees earned by our directors, other than Mr. John Smith our
	President and CEO, who does not receive DSUs, for the year ended December 31,
	2011. The directors may elect to have their fees paid in cash or DSUs. In March
	2012, after a peer review of director compensation was conducted by Semler
	Brossy, the Directors approved an increase in the annual DSU amount by an
	equivalent of C$5,000 DSUs per quarter to each Non-Employee Director, to be
	included in the quarterly awards going forward.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For 2011, each of our directors, save for Mr. Tomsett, received
	an annual director retainer of C$45,000; each committee member, excluding the
	committee chair, received an annual retainer of C$5,000; the Audit Committee
	chair received an annual retainer of C$15,000; and the other committee chairs
	received an annual retainer of C$10,000. Mr. Tomsett, as the chair of our Board
	of Directors, receives an annual board chair retainer fee of C$110,000, in place
	of the annual director retainer fee, annual committee member retainer fee and
	annual committee chair retainer fee. These retainer fees may be awarded in
	either cash or DSUs.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Silver Standard provides each Director the option of having an
	annual private medical examination.

	The Pirquitas mine has a fiscal stability agreement with the
	government of Argentina dating from 1998. In 2002, the government of Argentina
	implemented an export duty on concentrates that did not apply to companies with
	pre-existing fiscal stability agreements. In December 2007 the National Customs
	Authority of Argentina levied an export duty of approximately 10% from
	concentrates for projects with fiscal stability agreements pre-dating 2002. The
	Company has been advised that Pirquitas is subject to this export duty despite
	contrary rights detailed under the 1998 fiscal stability agreement. The legality
	of the export duty applied to silver concentrates has been challenged and is
	currently under review by the court in Argentina. In July 2010, the Company
	filed a claim in the provincial court for repayment of export duties paid on
	silver concentrates, and for an order to cease payment of the export duty until
	the matter has been decided by the court. An order was granted effective
	September 29, 2010 to cease payment of the export duty on silver concentrates
	pending the decision of the courts, and in April 2011 a government appeal
	against this order was denied.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As of December 31, 2011 the Pirquitas mine has paid $6.6
	million in export duties against which it has filed for recovery. In accordance
	with the order to cease payment the Company has not been paying export duties on
	silver concentrate but continues to accrue duties in full until the outcome of
	the claim is known with certainty. At December 31, 2011, the Company had accrued
	a liability totaling $13.1 million, with a corresponding impact on cost of sales
	in the relevant period. If this export duty is successfully overturned the
	benefit will be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the full
	amount of paid and unpaid duty in the period recovery becomes virtually certain.

	On October 26, 2011 the Argentina government announced a decree
	that requires all funds from mining export sales to be repatriated to Argentina
	and converted into Argentina Pesos within the Sole Foreign Exchange Market in
	Argentina, and each transfer is subject to a 0.6% transfer tax. The mining
	industry had previously been exempted from this tax. Although the aforementioned
	fiscal stability agreement also includes stability over foreign exchange
	controls, the government removed such benefits with this decree. The Company
	will comply with all laws and regulations, and is monitoring the situation
	closely. The impact of the transfer tax should not have a material impact on the
	Company.

	Shareholder Rights Plan
</I>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights
	Plan on March 9, 2012 (the &#147;Rights Plan&#148;). The Rights Plan is similar to
	existing shareholder rights plans adopted by other Canadian public companies.
	The Rights Plan has not been adopted in response to, or in anticipation of, any
	known take-over bid. The Rights Plan's objective is to ensure that all
	shareholders of the Company are treated equally and fairly in connection with
	any proposed takeover bid for the Company or other transaction that would
	involve a change in control.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Board has implemented the Rights Plan by authorizing the
	issuance, of one right (a &#147;Right&#148;) in respect of each outstanding common share
	of the Company (the &#147;Common Shares&#148;) at the close of business on March 9, 2012
	(the &#147;Record Time&#148;). In addition, the Board authorized the issuance of one Right
	in respect of each Common Share and other share of capital stock or voting
	interests of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
	(together with the Common Shares, the &#147;Voting Shares&#148;) issued from treasury
	after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time (as defined in the Rights
	Plan). Initially, the Rights will be attached to the Company&#146;s Voting Shares and
	will not be exercisable. Until such time as the Rights separate from the Voting
	Shares, when they become exercisable, Rights certificates will not be
	distributed to shareholders.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If a person, or a group acting jointly or in concert, acquires
	(other than pursuant to an exemption available under the Rights Plan) beneficial
	ownership of 20 percent or more of the Voting Shares, Rights (other than those
	held by such acquiring person or group which will become void) will separate
	from the Common Shares and each Right will permit the holder thereof to receive,
	upon exercise, the number of Common Shares having an aggregate market price (as determined
	in accordance with the Rights Plan), as of the date of consummation or
	occurrence of such acquisition of Common Shares, equal to four times the
	exercise price (as of the Separation Time) of the Right for an amount in cash
	equal to the exercise price. The exercise price of the Rights pursuant to the
	Rights Plan is four times the market price per Common Share.

	Convertible
	Note Purchase Agreement dated February 27, 2008 with UBS Securities LLC, Bear,
	Stearns &amp; Co., Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Blackmont Capital Inc.,
	GMP Securities L.P., National Bank Financial Inc. and Salman Partners Inc., as
	initial purchasers. Under the terms of the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement,
	we issued $138 million of convertible notes (the &#147;Convertible Notes&#148;) due March
	1, 2028 and bearing interest at a rate of 4.5% per year. The Convertible Notes
	will be convertible into our common shares at a fixed conversion rate, subject
	to certain anti-dilution adjustments, only in the event that (i) during
	specified consecutive trading periods, the market price of our common shares
	exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the Convertible Notes, (ii) the trading
	price of the Convertible Notes falls to 97% or less of the amount equal to the
	then prevailing price of our common shares, multiplied by the applicable
	conversion rate, (iii) the Convertible Notes are called for redemption, (iv)
	upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, or (v) during specified
	periods in early 2013 and 2028. On conversion, holders of the Convertible Notes
	will receive cash and, if applicable, common shares (or, at our election, in
	lieu of such common shares, cash or any combination of cash and common shares).
	In addition, if certain fundamental changes occur to us, holders of the
	Convertible Notes may be entitled to an increased conversion rate. The
	Convertible Notes will be convertible into our common shares at an initial
	conversion rate of 23.0792 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of
	Convertible Notes converted, representing an initial conversion price of
	approximately $43.33 per common share, which is approximately 130% of the
	closing price of our common shares on the Nasdaq Global Market on February 21,
	2008. Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to
	repurchase all or part of their Convertible Notes on March 1 of each of 2013,
	2018 and 2023, and upon certain fundamental corporate changes. The repurchase
	price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes
	being converted, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
	repurchase date. Subject to specified conditions, we shall pay the purchase
	price in cash. On and after March 5, 2013, we may redeem all or part of the
	Convertible Notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
	amount of the Convertible Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest
	to, but excluding, the redemption date. See Item 5.B under the heading
	&#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148;.

	Exchange Controls and Investment Canada Act

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Canada has no system of exchange controls. There are no
	exchange restrictions on borrowing from foreign countries or on the remittance
	of dividends, interest, royalties and similar payments, management fees, loan
	repayments, settlement of trade debts, or the repatriation of capital. Any such
	remittances to United States residents, however, may be subject to a withholding
	tax pursuant to the Canadian Income Tax Act as modified by the reciprocal tax
	treaty between Canada and the United States. See &#147;Item 10.E, &#147;Taxation&#148;.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Investment Canada Act (the &#147;Act&#148;), enacted on June 20,
	1985, requires, depending on the circumstances and subject to certain
	exceptions, either pre-closing review by, or post-closing notification to, the
	Government of Canada on the &#147;acquisition of control&#148; of &#147;Canadian businesses&#148; by
	&#147;non-Canadians&#148;, as such terms are defined in the Act. The term &#147;acquisition of
	control&#148; is defined as any one or more non-Canadian persons acquiring all or
	substantially all of the assets used in the Canadian business, the acquisition
	of the voting shares of a Canadian corporation carrying on the Canadian business
	or the acquisition of the voting interests of an entity controlling or carrying
	on the Canadian business. The acquisition of the majority of the outstanding
	shares is deemed to be an &#147;acquisition of control&#148; of a corporation. The
	acquisition of less than a majority, but one-third or more, of the voting shares
	of a corporation is presumed to be an &#147;acquisition of control&#148; of a corporation
	unless it can be established that the purchaser will not control the
	corporation.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Investments requiring review are all direct acquisitions of
	Canadian businesses with assets of $5,000,000 or more (subject to the comments
	below on WTO investors), and all indirect acquisitions of Canadian businesses
	(subject to the comments below on WTO investors) with assets of more than
	$50,000,000 or with assets of between $5,000,000 and $50,000,000 which represent
	more than 50% of the value of the total international transaction. In addition,
	specific acquisitions or new businesses in designated types of business
	activities related to Canada&#146;s cultural heritage or national identity could
	require review following notification if the Government of Canada considers that
	it is in the public interest to do so.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Furthermore, all investments (regardless of transaction size or
	whether control has been acquired) may be reviewed either prior to or after
	closing of the transaction on national security grounds, despite the fact that
	such investments may not otherwise be reviewable. The relevant test is whether
	the investment is &#147;injurious to national security&#148;, however, the Act does not
	define &#147;national security&#148;, nor does it identify the relevant factors that may
	be taken into account for purposes of this review. The definition of &#147;Canadian
	business&#148; that applies under national security reviews is also significantly
	broader than otherwise applies under the Act, which expands the number of
	transactions that may be subject to this form of review.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Act was amended with the implementation of the Agreement
	establishing the World Trade Organization (&#147;WTO&#148;) to provide for special review
	thresholds for &#147;WTO investors&#148;, as defined in the Act. &#147;WTO investor&#148; generally
	means (i) an individual, other than a Canadian, who is a national or a WTO
	member (such as, for example, the United States), or who has the right of
	permanent residence in relation to that WTO member, (ii) governments of WTO
	members, and (iii) entities that are not Canadian controlled, but which are WTO
	investor controlled, as determined by rules specified in the Act. If the WTO
	investor rules apply, an investment in our shares by or from a WTO investor will
	be reviewable only if (i) it is direct investment to acquire control of Silver
	Standard and (ii) the book value of our assets is equal to or greater than a
	specified amount (the &#147;WTO Review Threshold&#148;). The WTO Review Threshold is
	adjusted annually by a formula relating to increases in the nominal gross
	domestic product of Canada. The 2012 WTO Review Threshold is $330,000,000.
	However, both the special WTO Review Threshold and the exemption from review for
	indirect investments by and from WTO investors do not apply to WTO investors,
	and the general rules described in the preceding paragraph do apply, to the
	acquisition of control of certain types of businesses specified in the Act,
	including a business that is a &#147;cultural business&#148;. In addition, upon certain
	amendments to the Act made in March 2009 taking effect, the threshold for direct
	acquisitions by WTO investors will be replaced with an &#147;enterprise value&#148;
	threshold initially set at $600,000,000, which will subsequently increase first
	to $800,000,000 two years after the new threshold is adopted, and later to $1
	billion, to be adjusted annually by a formula relating to increases in the
	nominal gross domestic product of Canada.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If any non-Canadian, whether or not a WTO investor, acquires
	control of Silver Standard by the acquisition of shares where the transaction is
	not reviewable as described above, the non-Canadian is required to notify the
	Canadian government and to provide certain basic information relating to the
	investment. A non-Canadian, whether or not a WTO investor, is also required to
	provide a notice to the government on the establishment of a new Canadian
	business. If our business is then a prescribed type of business activity related
	to Canada&#146;s cultural heritage or national identity, and if the Canadian
	government considers it to be in the public interest to do so, then the Canadian
	government may give notice in writing within 21 days requiring the investment to
	be reviewed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For non-Canadians (other than WTO investors), an indirect
	acquisition of control, by the acquisition of voting interests of an entity that
	directly or indirectly controls Silver Standard, is reviewable if the book value
	of our assets is then $50,000,000 or more. If the WTO investor rules apply, then
	this requirement does not apply to a WTO investor, or to a person acquiring the
	entity from a WTO investor. Special rules specified in the Act would apply if
	the value of our assets is more than 50% of the value of the entity so acquired.
	By these special rules, if the non-Canadian (other than a WTO investor) were to
	acquire indirect control of Silver Standard, and the value of our assets and all
	other entities carrying on business in Canada, calculated in the manner provided
	in the Act and the regulations under the Act, is more than 50% of the value,
	calculated in the manner provided in the Act and the regulations under the Act,
	of the assets of all entities, the control of which is acquired, directly or
	indirectly, in the transaction of which the acquisition of control of Silver
	Standard forms a part, then the thresholds for a direct acquisition of control
	as discussed above will apply, that is, a threshold of $5,000,000 for a
	non-Canadian other than a WTO investor. If the value exceeds that level, then
	the transaction must be reviewed in the same manner as if the transaction were a
	direct acquisition of control.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If an investment is reviewable, an application for review in
	the form prescribed by the regulations is required to be filed with the Director
	appointed under the Act (the &#147;Director&#148;) prior to the investment taking place
	and the investment may not be consummated until the review has been completed.
	There are, however, certain exceptions. Applications concerning reviewable
	investments in culture-sensitive sectors are required upon receipt of a notice
	for review. In addition, the Minister (a person designated as such under the
	Act) may permit an investment to be consummated prior to completion of the
	review if he is satisfied that delay would cause undue hardship to the acquirer
	or jeopardize the operations of the Canadian business that is being acquired.
	The Director will submit the application to the Minister, together with any other information or written undertakings
	given by the acquirer and any representation submitted to the Director by a
	province that is likely to be significantly affected by the investment.

	The Minister will then determine whether the investment is
	likely to be of net benefit to Canada, taking into account the information
	provided and having regard to certain factors of assessment where they are

	is likely to be of net benefit to Canada, or (b) he is unable to complete his
	review, in which case he shall have 30 additional days to complete his review
	(unless the acquirer agrees to a longer period), or (c) he is not satisfied that

	Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Consequences
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The discussion under this heading summarizes the principal
	Canadian federal income tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of
	common shares of the Company for a shareholder of the Company who is not a
	resident of Canada but is a resident of the United States and who will acquire
	and hold common shares of the Company as capital property for the purposes of
	the
<I>
	Income Tax Act
</I>
	(Canada) (the &#147;Canadian Tax Act&#148;). This summary does
	not apply to a shareholder who carries on business in Canada through a
	&#147;permanent establishment&#148; situated in Canada or performs independent personal
	services in Canada through a fixed base in Canada if the shareholder&#146;s holding
	in the Company is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or
	fixed base. This summary is based on the provisions of the Canadian Tax Act and
	the regulations thereunder and on an understanding of the administrative
	practices of the Canada Revenue Agency, and takes into account all specific
	proposals to amend the Canadian Tax Act or regulations made by the Minister of
	Finance of Canada as of the date hereof. It has been assumed that there will be
	no other relevant amendment of any governing law although no assurance can be
	given in this respect. The Company recommends shareholders seek the advice of
	their own Canadian and U.S. tax advisors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The provisions of the Canadian Tax Act are subject to income
	tax treaties to which Canada is a party, including the Canada-United States
	Income Tax Convention (1980), as amended (the &#147;Convention&#148;).

<B>
	Dividends on Common Shares and Other Income
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under the Canadian Tax Act, a non-resident of Canada is
	generally subject to Canadian withholding tax at the rate of 25% on dividends
	paid or deemed to have been paid to him or her by a corporation resident in
	Canada. The Convention limits the rate to 15% if the shareholder is a resident
	of the United States and the dividends are beneficially owned by and paid to
	such shareholder, and to 5% if the shareholder is also a corporation that
	beneficially owns at least 10% of the voting shares of the payor corporation.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The amount of a stock dividend (for tax purposes) would
	generally be equal to the amount by which the paid up or stated capital of the
	Company had increased by reason of the payment of such dividend. The Company
	will furnish additional tax information to shareholders in the event of such a
	dividend.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Convention generally exempts from Canadian income tax
	dividends paid to a religious, scientific, literary, educational or charitable
	organization or to an organization constituted and operated exclusively to
	administer a pension, retirement or employee benefit fund or plan, if the
	organization is a resident of the United States and is exempt from income tax
	under the laws of the United States.

	Dispositions of Common Shares
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under the Canadian Tax Act, a taxpayer&#146;s capital gain or
	capital loss from a disposition of a common share of the Company is the amount,
	if any, by which his or her proceeds of disposition exceed (or are exceeded by,
	respectively) the aggregate of his or her adjusted cost base of the share and
	reasonable expenses of disposition. The capital gain or loss must be computed in
	Canadian currency using a weighted average adjusted cost base for identical
	properties. One-half of a capital gain (the &#147;taxable capital gain&#148;) is included
	in income, and one-half of a capital loss in a year (the &#147;allowable capital
	loss&#148;) is deductible from taxable capital gains realized in the same year. The
	amount by which a shareholder&#146;s allowable capital loss exceeds the taxable
	capital gain in a year may be deducted from a taxable capital gain realized by
	the shareholder in the three previous years or any subsequent year, subject to
	certain restrictions in the case of a corporate shareholder and subject to
	adjustment when the capital gains inclusion rate in the year of disposition
	differs from the inclusion rate in the year the deduction is claimed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If a common share of the Company is disposed of to the Company
	other than in the open market in the manner in which shares would normally be
	purchased by the public, the proceeds of disposition will, in general terms, be
	considered as limited to the paid-up capital of the share and the balance of the
	price paid will be deemed to be a dividend. In the case of a shareholder that is
	a corporation, the amount of any capital loss otherwise determined may be
	reduced, in certain circumstances, by the amount of dividends previously
	received in respect of the shares disposed of, unless the corporation owned the
	shares for at least 365 days prior to sustaining the loss and (together with
	corporations, persons and other entities, with whom the corporation was not
	dealing at arm&#146;s length) did not own more than five percent of the shares of any
	class of the corporation from which the dividend was received. These loss
	limitation rules may also apply where a corporation is a member of a partnership
	or a beneficiary of a trust that owned the shares disposed of.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under the Canadian Tax Act, a non-resident of Canada is subject
	to Canadian tax on taxable capital gains, and may deduct allowable capital
	losses, realized on a disposition of &#147;taxable Canadian property.&#148; Common shares
	of the Company will constitute taxable Canadian property of a shareholder at a
	particular time if (i) the shareholder used the shares in carrying on business
	in Canada, or if at any time in the five years immediately preceding the
	disposition 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series in the
	capital stock of the Company belonged to one or more persons in a group
	comprising the shareholder and persons with whom the shareholder did not deal at
	arm&#146;s length and (ii) the value of the shares is derived principally from real

	Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The following is a general summary of certain material
	anticipated U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder, as defined
	below, of the ownership and disposition of Common Shares in the Company. This
	discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
	&#147;Code&#148;), Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code (&#147;Treasury
	Regulations&#148;), administrative pronouncements or practices, judicial decisions,
	and the Income Tax Convention between the U.S. and Canada (the &#147;Tax
	Convention&#148;), all as of the date hereof. Future legislative, judicial, or
	administrative modifications, revocations, or interpretations, which may or may
	not be retroactive, may result in U.S. federal income tax consequences
	significantly different from those discussed herein. This discussion is not
	binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;). No ruling has been or
	will be sought or obtained from the IRS with respect to any of the U.S. federal
	income tax consequences discussed herein. There can be no assurance that the IRS
	will not challenge any of the conclusions described herein or that a U.S. court
	will not sustain such a challenge.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax
	consequences to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, including U.S. Holders
	that (i) are banks, financial institutions, or insurance companies, (ii) are
	regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts, (iii) are
	brokers, dealers, or traders in securities or currencies, (iv) are tax-exempt
	organizations, (v) hold Common Shares as part of hedges, straddles, constructive
	sales, conversion transactions, or other integrated investments, (vi) acquire
	Common Shares as compensation for services or through the exercise or
	cancellation of employee stock options or warrants, (vii) have a functional
	currency other than the U.S. dollar, (viii) own or have owned directly,
	indirectly, or constructively 10% or more of the voting power of the Company, or
	(ix) are subject to the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this discussion
	does not address any U.S. federal estate, gift, or other non-income tax, or any
	state, local, or non-U.S. tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of
	Common Shares.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As used herein, &#147;U.S. Holder&#148; means a beneficial owner of
	Common Shares that is (i) an individual that is a citizen or resident of the
	U.S. for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) a corporation (or other entity
	taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
	organized in or under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof, or the District
	of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal
	income tax regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust that (a) is subject to the
	primary jurisdiction of a court within the U.S. and for which one or more U.S.
	persons have authority to control all substantial decisions or (b) has a valid
	election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S.
	person.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If a pass-through entity, including a partnership or other
	entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds
	Common Shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an owner or partner
	generally will depend on the status of such owner or partner and on the
	activities of the pass-through entity. A U.S. person that is an owner or partner
	of a pass-through entity holding Common Shares is urged to consult its own tax
	advisor.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	This discussion assumes that Common Shares are held as capital
	assets (generally, property held for investment), within the meaning of the
	Code, in the hands of a U.S. Holder at all relevant times.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A U.S. HOLDER OF COMMON SHARES IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX
	ADVISOR REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO ITS

	STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S., OR OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION.

	Distributions on Common Shares
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Subject to the discussion below under &#147;Passive Foreign
	Investment Company (PFIC) Considerations,&#148; the gross amount of any distribution
	paid by the Company will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax as
	dividend income to the extent paid out of the Company&#146;s current or accumulated
	earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.
	Such amount will be includable in gross income by a U.S. Holder as ordinary
	income on the date such U.S. Holder actually or constructively receives the
	distribution. Dividends paid by the Company will not be eligible for the
	dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporations.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Subject to applicable exceptions with respect to short-term and
	hedged positions, certain dividends received by non-corporate U.S. Holders prior
	to January 1, 2013 from a &#147;qualified foreign corporation&#148; may be eligible for
	reduced rates of taxation (&#147;qualified dividends&#148;). A qualified foreign
	corporation includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of
	a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the U.S. Treasury
	Department determines to be satisfactory for these purposes and that includes an
	exchange of information provision. The U.S. Treasury has determined that the Tax
	Convention meets these requirements, and the Company believes it is eligible for
	the benefits of the Tax Convention. Dividends received by U.S. investors from a
	foreign corporation that was a passive foreign investment company (a &#147;PFIC&#148;) in
	either the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year will
	not constitute qualified dividends. However, as discussed below under &#147;Passive
	Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) Considerations,&#148; the Company believes that it
	was not a PFIC for its 2011 taxable year and that it likely will not be a PFIC
	for its 2012 taxable year (and possibly subsequent taxable years). Accordingly,
	dividends paid on the Common Shares will likely constitute qualified dividends.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Dividends received by a U.S. Holder with respect to Common
	Shares will constitute foreign source income, which may be relevant in
	calculating the holder&#146;s foreign tax credit limitation. The limitation on
	foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to
	specific classes of income. For this purpose, dividends paid by the Company with
	respect to the Common Shares will, depending on a U.S. Holder&#146;s circumstances,
	be &#147;passive category&#148; or &#147;general category&#148; income.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Subject to certain limitations, any Canadian tax withheld with
	respect to distributions made on the Common Shares may be treated as foreign
	taxes eligible for credit against a U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax
	liability. Alternatively, a U.S. Holder may, subject to applicable limitations,
	elect to deduct the otherwise creditable Canadian withholding taxes for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are
	complex and their application depends on each taxpayer&#146;s particular
	circumstances. Accordingly, U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax
	advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their
	particular circumstances.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	To the extent that a distribution exceeds the amount of the
	Company&#146;s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S.
	federal income tax principles, it will be treated first as a tax-free return of
	capital, causing a reduction in the U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the
	Common Shares held by such U.S. Holder (thereby increasing the amount of gain,
	or decreasing the amount of loss, to be recognized by such U.S. Holder upon a
	subsequent disposition of the Common Shares), with any amount that exceeds the
	adjusted tax basis being taxed as a capital gain recognized on a sale or
	exchange (as discussed under &#147;Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of
	Common Shares&#148; below). However, the Company does not intend to maintain
	calculations of earnings and profits in a manner necessary to enable U.S.
	Holders to determine the extent to which a distribution would be treated as a
	dividend. Each U.S. Holder should therefore assume that any distribution by the
	Company with respect to the Common Shares will constitute ordinary dividend
	income.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The gross amount of distributions paid in any foreign currency
	will be included by each U.S. Holder in gross income in a U.S. dollar amount
	calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day the distributions are paid, regardless of whether the payment is in
	fact converted into U.S. dollars. If the foreign currency is converted into U.S.
	dollars on the date of the payment, the U.S. Holder should not be required to
	recognize any foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the receipt of the
	foreign currency distributions. If instead the foreign currency is converted at
	a later date, any currency gains or losses resulting from the conversion of the
	foreign currency will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Subject to the discussion below under &#147;Passive Foreign
	Investment Company (PFIC) Considerations,&#148; a U.S. Holder generally will
	recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of
	Common Shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized
	on the disposition and the U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the Common
	Shares. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if
	the U.S. Holder held the Common Shares for more than one year at the time of the
	sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition. Preferential tax rates may apply
	to long-term capital gains or losses of a U.S. Holder that is an individual,

	limitations.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

	Special and generally unfavorable U.S. federal income tax rules
	may apply to a U.S. Holder if its holding period in its Common Shares includes
	any period during a taxable year of the Company in which the Company is a PFIC.
	A non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC for each taxable year in which (i) 75% or more
	of its gross income is passive income or (ii) 50% or more of the average value
	(or, in certain circumstances, the adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes) of its assets are assets that either produce or are held for the
	production of passive income.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For purposes of the PFIC rules, and subject to certain
	exceptions, passive income includes, in part, dividends, interest, royalties,
	rents, and net gains from certain transactions in commodities. Net gains from
	transactions in commodities will not be passive income for purposes of the PFIC
	rules if (i) they are active business gains or losses from the sale of
	commodities, and (ii) substantially all of the taxpayer&#146;s commodities are (a)
	shares in trade or inventory of it, (b) property used in its trade or business,
	or (c) supplies regularly used or consumed by it in the ordinary course of its
	trade or business.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under these PFIC rules, the Company believes that (i) it was
	not a PFIC for its 2011 taxable year, (ii) based on the Company&#146;s current and
	anticipated operations, that it will not be a PFIC for its 2012 and subsequent
	taxable years. There can be no assurance regarding the PFIC classification of
	the Company for its 2012 and subsequent taxable years, because PFIC
	classification is fundamentally factual in nature, is determined annually, and
	generally cannot be determined until the close of the taxable year in question.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	If the Company were classified as a PFIC for any year during
	which a U.S. Holder holds Common Shares (regardless of whether the Company
	continues to be a PFIC), such U.S. Holder would be subject to special adverse
	rules, including taxation at maximum ordinary income rates plus an interest
	charge on both gains on sale and certain dividends, unless such U.S. Holder
	makes an election to be taxed under an alternative regime. The Company will
	provide U.S. Holders with information concerning the potential availability of
	such elections if it determines that it is or will become a PFIC.

	For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, certain
	U.S. Holders who are individuals, estates, or trusts and whose income exceeds

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under U.S. federal income tax law and regulations, certain
	categories of U.S. Holders must file information returns with respect to their
	investment in, or involvement in, a foreign corporation. Penalties for failure
	to file certain of these information returns are substantial. U.S. Holders of
	the Common Shares should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the
	requirements of filing information returns.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Dividends and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of
	Common Shares that are paid in the United States or by a U.S.-related financial
	intermediary will be subject to U.S. information reporting rules, unless a U.S.
	Holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient. In addition, payments that
	are subject to information reporting may be subject to backup withholding
	(currently at a 28% rate) if a U.S. Holder does not provide its correct taxpayer
	identification number and otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules.
	Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld under the backup
	withholding rules are available to be credited against a U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S.
	federal income tax liability and may be refunded to the extent they exceed such

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash
	flows of the Company&#146;s financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes
	in foreign exchange rates. The Company&#146;s financial instruments are exposed to
	currency risk where those instruments are denominated in currencies that are not
	the same as their functional currency; exchange gains and losses in these
	situations impact earnings. The Company&#146;s sale of silver and zinc are
	denominated in U.S. dollars and thus the risk is related to costs incurred and
	other non-U.S. dollars financial instruments.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As at December 31, our exposure to currency risk in currencies
	other than the U.S. dollar is stated in the table below. Based on the net
	exposures at December 31, 2011, a 10% depreciation or appreciation of the
	currencies against the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease or increase,
	respectively, in our after-tax earnings by $12,129,000 and $11,135,000 as set
	out in more detail in the table below.

	Interest Rate Risk

<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair values and future
	cash flows of the Company will fluctuate because of changes in market interest
	rates. Interest rate risk mainly arises from the interest rate impact on the
	Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalents because they are the only financial
	instrument the Company holds that earns interest based on variable market
	interest rates. The long-term convertible notes have fixed interest rates and
	therefore cash flows are not exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, however
	a change in interest rates would impact the fair value of the instruments but
	because the Company records the notes at amortized cost there would be no impact
	on the financial results of the Company. The Company monitors its exposure to
	interest rates closely and has not entered into any derivative contracts to
	manage its risk.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	At December 31, 2011, the weighted average interest rate of
	cash equivalents was 0.14% (2010 - 0.89%) . With other variables unchanged, a 1%
	increase in the interest rate would increase after-tax net income by $2,340,000
	(2010 - $450,000).

	Management is responsible for establishing and

	disclosure controls and procedures. All internal control systems, no
	matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or
	detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
	effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
	statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
	evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
	controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
	the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
	deteriorate.

	On August 31, 2011 the former Chief Financial Officer left the

	It should be noted that while our principal executive officer

	disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting
	will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well
	conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
	the objectives of the control system are met.

	to comply with all of the Nasdaq&#146;s corporate governance requirements to which we
	would be subject if we were a U.S. corporation, our governance practices comply
	with the Nasdaq&#146;s requirements as if we were a U.S. domestic issuer, except that
	A.E. Michael Anglin would not be permitted to serve on the Audit Committee under
	Nasdaq listing rules due to the fact that he participated in the preparation of
	financial statements by virtue of holding the position of interim President and
	Chief Executive Officer of the Company from January 19, 2010 to August 6, 2010,
	while the Company searched for a replacement CEO due to the resignation of
	Robert A. Quartermain. The Board has determined that A.E. Michael Anglin has no
	direct or indirect material relationship with the Company which could interfere
	with his exercise of judgement and therefore he is an independent director. Mr.
	Anglin is not prohibited under Canadian requirements from serving on the

	Management&#146;s Responsibility for the Financial

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The preparation and presentation of the accompanying
	consolidated financial statements and Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis
	(&#147;MD&amp;A&#148;) are the responsibility of management and have been approved by the
	Board of Directors.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
	accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the
	International Accounting Standards Board. Financial statements, by nature, are
	not precise since they include certain amounts based upon estimates and
	judgements. When alternative methods exist, management has chosen those it deems
	to be the most appropriate in the circumstances.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Management, under the supervision of and the participation of
	the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has a
	process in place to evaluate disclosure controls and procedures and internal
	control over financial reporting as required by Canadian and U.S. securities
	regulations. We, as President and Chief Executive Officer and as Chief Financial
	Officer, will certify our annual filings with the CSA and SEC as required in
	Canada by National Instrument 52-109 and in the United States as required by the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that
	management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and is
	ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the consolidated financial
	statements. The Board carries out this responsibility principally through its
	Audit Committee which is independent from management.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors and
	reviews the consolidated financial statements and MD&amp;A; considers the report
	of the external auditors; assesses the adequacy of our internal controls,
	including management&#146;s assessment described below; examines the fees and
	expenses for audit services; and recommends to the Board the independent
	auditors for appointment by the shareholders. The independent auditors have full
	and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with it to discuss their audit
	work, our internal control over financial reporting and financial reporting
	matters. The Audit Committee reports its findings to the Board for consideration
	when approving the consolidated financial statements for issuance to the
	shareholders and management&#146;s assessment of the internal control over financial
	reporting.

</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
	adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management has assessed the
	effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
	31, 2011 using criteria established in
<I>
	Internal Control &#150; Integrated
	Framework
</I>
	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
	Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our
	internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
	2011.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our auditor, has audited the
	effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
	31, 2011, as stated in their report which appears herein.

</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	To the Shareholders of Silver Standard Resources Inc.
</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We have completed an integrated audit of Silver Standard
	Resources Inc.&#146;s and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) December 31, 2011
	consolidated financial statements and their internal control over financial
	reporting as at December 31, 2011 and an audit of their December 31, 2010
	consolidated financial statements. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
	presented below.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Report on the consolidated financial statements
<BR>
</B>
	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Silver
	Standard Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated
	statement of financial position as at December 31, 2011, 2010 and January 1,
	2010 and the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in
	shareholders&#146; equity and cash flows and for the years ended December 31, 2011
	and 2010, and the related notes, which comprise a summary of significant
	accounting policies and other explanatory information.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Management&#146;s responsibility for the consolidated financial
	statements
<BR>
</B>
	Management is responsible for the preparation and fair
	presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with
	International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International
	Accounting Standards Board
<B>
</B>
	and for such internal control as management
	determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
	statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
	error.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Auditor&#146;s responsibility
<BR>
</B>
	Our responsibility is to
	express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
	audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted
	auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit
	to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
	statements are free from material misstatement. Canadian generally accepted
	auditing standards require that we comply with ethical requirements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
	evidence, on a test basis, about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
	financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor&#146;s judgment,
	including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
	consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
	those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the
	Company&#146;s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
	statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
	accounting principles and policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
	estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
	the consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our
	audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on
	the consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Opinion
<BR>
</B>
	In our opinion, the consolidated financial
	statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
	Silver Standard Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries as at December 31, 2011,
	2010 and January 1, 2010 and their financial performance and their cash flows
	for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 in accordance with International
	Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
	Standards Board.

	Report on internal control over financial reporting
<BR>
</B>
	We have also audited Silver Standard Resources Inc.&#146;s and its subsidiaries&#146;
	internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2011, based on
	criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the
	Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

	Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Auditor&#146;s responsibility
<BR>
</B>
	Our responsibility is to
	express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting
	based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
	reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
	perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
	internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
	respects.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
	obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
	assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
	design and operating effectiveness of internal control, based on the assessed
	risk, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
	circumstances.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
	audit opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Definition of internal control over financial reporting
<BR>
</B>
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process
	designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
	reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal
	control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
	(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
	and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
	Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
	necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
	generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
	the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
	and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
	prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
	of the Company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
	statements.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Inherent limitations
<BR>
</B>
	Because of its inherent
	limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
	misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
	periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
	changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
	procedures may deteriorate.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Opinion
<BR>
</B>
	In our opinion, Silver Standard Resources
	Inc. and its subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
	internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2011, based on
	criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

	The Company prepares its financial
	statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles
	(&#147;Canadian GAAP&#148;) as set out in the Handbook of the Canadian Institute of
	Chartered Accountants (&#147;CICA Handbook&#148;). In 2010, the CICA Handbook was revised
	to incorporate International Financial Reporting Standards (&#147;IFRS&#148;), and to
	require publicly accountable enterprises to apply such standards effective for
	years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. Accordingly, these are the
	Company&#146;s first annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance
	with IFRS. In the financial statements, the term &#145;Canadian GAAP&#146; refers to
	Canadian GAAP before the adoption of IFRS.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	These consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International
	Accounting Standards Board (&#147;IASB&#148;) and Interpretations issued by the
	International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (&#147;IFRIC&#148;). The
	comparative information has also been prepared on this basis, with the exception
	of certain items, details of which are given below, for which comparative
	information has not been restated.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The basis of preparation of these annual
	consolidated financial statements is different to that of the most recent
	comparative year&#146;s annual consolidated financial statements due to the first
	time adoption of IFRS. An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected
	the reported statement of income and statement of financial position is provided
	in note 26. This note includes reconciliations of equity and of income for the
	period ended December 31, 2010 previously reported under Canadian GAAP to those
	amounts reported under IFRS.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The policies applied in these
	consolidated financial statements are based on IFRS issued and outstanding as of
	March 11, 2012, the date the statements were issued.

	The rules for first-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1,

	An associate is an entity over whose operating and
	financial policies the Company exercises significant influence.
	Significant influence is presumed to exist where the Company has between
	20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights, but can also arise where
	the Company holds less than 20 per cent of the voting rights, but it has
	power to be actively involved and influential in policy decisions
	affecting the entity. The Company&#146;s share of the net assets, post tax
	results and reserves of the associate are included in the financial
	statements using the equity accounting method. This involves recording the
	investment initially at cost to the Company, and then, in subsequent
	periods, adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to reflect the
	Company&#146;s share of the associate&#146;s results. Unrealized gains on
	transactions between the Company and its associate are eliminated to the
	extent of the Company&#146;s interest in the associate.

	Concentrate sales typically are
	provisionally valued upon shipment, with the final value of the concentrate sale
	determined after receipt of final weights and assays and after the
	contractually-agreed metal pricing period, which typically occurs two to six
	months after shipment. Once the recognition criteria are met, fair value is
	estimated and revenues are recorded, based on metal spot prices at that date,
	provisionally-estimated amounts of metals contained, and processing charges. As
	a result of this process, the value of concentrate receivables changes during
	the period between initial recognition and final pricing. This component of the
	contract is an embedded derivative, which is recognized at fair value based on
	the forward sales price at the end of the reporting period with changes in value
	recorded in revenue. Such adjustments to revenue for metal prices are recorded
	at each reporting date, until the final sales price has been determined.

	Deferred tax is recognized, using the

	bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax is determined

	instruments in the following categories: at fair value through profit and loss
	(&#147;FVTPL&#148;), loans and receivables, available-for-sale, held to maturity, and

	classification of financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company has not classified any

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL
</B>
	Financial assets and liabilities carried at FVTPL are recorded at fair value
	and transaction costs are expensed in the statement of income. Realized and
	unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the
	financial assets or liabilities held at FVTPL are included in the statement of
	income in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are included in this
	category unless they are designated as hedges. Generally, the Company does not
	acquire financial assets for the purpose of selling in the short term.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Loans and receivables
</B>
	Loans and
	receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
	payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are classified as current
	assets or non-current assets based on their maturity date. Loans and receivables
	are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently carried at amortized
	cost less any impairment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Available-for-sale financial assets
</B>
	Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either
	designated as available for sale or not classified in any of the other
	categories.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Available-for-sale assets are initially
	recorded at fair value plus transaction costs, and are subsequently carried at
	fair value. All unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair
	value of assets classified as available-for-sale are recognized directly in
	other comprehensive income, except for unrealized foreign exchange gains or
	losses on monetary financial assets and impairment losses which are recognized
	in the statement of income. Any reversal of a previously recognized impairment
	loss on a non-monetary asset is recognized directly in other comprehensive
	income. Realized gains and losses from the derecognition of available for sale
	assets are recognized in the statement of income in the period derecognized with
	any unrealized gains or losses being recycled from other comprehensive income.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>
	Other financial liabilities
</B>
	Other financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value, net of
	transaction costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortized cost. Any
	difference between the initial cost and the redemption value is recognized in
	the statement of income over the period to maturity using the effective interest
	method.

	The Company&#146;s policy with regard to &#145;Financial Risk Management&#146; is set out

	to reduce the exposures related to assets and liabilities, or anticipated
	transactions.

	Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates

	The Company estimates its mineral reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by qualified persons as defined by National Instrument (&ldquo;NI&rdquo;) 43-101.
	Mineral reserves determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, and for forecasting the timing of the payment of close down and restoration costs. In assessing the life of a mine for
	accounting purposes, mineral resources are only taken into account where there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves, and assumptions that are valid at the
	time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of mineral reserves and may,
	ultimately, result in mineral reserve estimates being revised. Such changes in mineral reserves could impact on depreciation and amortization rates, asset carrying values and the provision for close down and restoration costs.

	Close down and restoration provision
</B>
	Close down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining, and the majority of close down and restoration expenditures are incurred near the end of the life of the mine. The
	Company&rsquo;s accounting policy requires the recognition of such provisions when the obligation occurs. The initial provisions are periodically reviewed during the life of the operation to reflect known developments, e.g. updated cost estimates
	and revisions to the estimated lives of operations. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Company estimates its costs based on studies using current restoration standards and techniques. The initial closure provisions together
	with changes, other than those arising from the unwinding of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of the provision, are capitalized within property plant and equipment and depreciated over the lives of the assets to which they
	relate.

	The ultimate magnitude of these costs is uncertain, and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including changes to the relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or experience at other
	mine sites, local inflation rates and exchange rates when liabilities are anticipated to be settled in a currency other than the United States dollar. The expected timing of expenditure can also change, for example, in response to changes in mineral
	reserves or production rates or economic conditions. As a result there could be significant adjustments to the provision for close down and restoration, which would affect future financial results.

	extent to which potential future tax benefits may be used. The Company is subject to assessments by various taxation authorities, which may interpret legislation differently. These differences may affect the final amount or the timing of the payment
	of taxes. The Company provides for such differences where known based on management&rsquo;s best estimate of the probable outcome of these matters.

	IFRS 9,

</I>
	(&#147;IFRS 9&#148;) was issued in November 2009 and contained requirements for financial
	assets. This standard addresses classification and measurement of financial
	assets and replaces multiple category and measurement models in IAS 39 for debt
	instruments with a new mixed measurement model having only two categories:
	amortized cost and FVTPL. IFRS 9 also replaces the models for measuring equity
	instruments, and such investments are either recognized at FVTPL or at fair
	value through other comprehensive income. Where such equity instruments are
	measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, dividends are
	recognized in profit or loss to the extent not clearly representing a return of
	investment; however, other gains and losses (including impairments) associated
	with such instruments remain in accumulated comprehensive income indefinitely.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Requirements for financial liabilities
	were added in October 2010 and they largely carried forward existing
	requirements in IAS 39, Financial Instruments &#150; Recognition and Measurement,
	except that fair value changes due to credit risk for liabilities designated at
	fair value through profit and loss would generally be recorded in other
	comprehensive income.

	IFRS 10 establishes control as the single basis for
	consolidation of entities, regardless of the nature of the investee. An
	entity has control over an investee when it has power over it; it is
	exposed, or has the rights, to variable returns from its involvement with
	the investee; and has the ability to use its power over the investee to
	affect those returns. IFRS 10 replaces IAS 27&#146;s guidance that addresses
	when and how an investor should prepare consolidated financial statements
	and replaces all of SIC-12. The Company has not yet assessed the impact of
	the standard or determined whether it will adopt the standard

	IFRS 11 requires a venturer to classify its interest in a
	joint arrangement as a joint venture or joint operation. A joint operation
	is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have
	rights to the assets and the obligations for the liabilities. A joint
	venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control
	of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The
	determination whether a joint arrangement constitutes a joint operation or
	a joint venture is based on the parties&#146; rights and responsibilities under
	the arrangement and thus the existence of a separate legal vehicle is no
	longer the main factor in making such determination. Joint ventures will
	be accounted for using the equity method of accounting thereby eliminating
	the option available under existing IFRS to use either the proportionate
	consolidation method or the equity method. Joint operations are accounted
	for by a venturer by recognizing its share of the assets, liabilities,
	revenues and expenses of the joint operation. The Company has not yet
	assessed the impact of the standard or determined whether it will adopt
	the standard early.

<I>
	Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income
</I>
	(amendments to IAS 1,
<I>
	Presentation of Financial Statements
</I>
	). The amendments require the
	grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income into items that might

	be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The amendments are
	effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2012, with full

<I>
	Stripping

	The Company received a $10,060,000 (C$10,000,000)
	convertible debenture with a coupon rate of 3% per annum from Aurcana
	Corporation (&#147;Aurcana&#148;) as part of the consideration received for the sale
	of the Shafter Silver property in 2008. The convertible debenture was
	repayable on July 15, 2011, and the Company had the option to convert any
	portion of the principal amount into Aurcana common shares at a deemed
	conversion price of C$1.52 per share (up to 6,600,000 shares) until that
	date. In 2009, the coupon rate on the debenture was revised from 3% per
	year to 1.5% in the first year and 4% per year thereafter, which resulted
	in an impairment of $2,002,000 for the year ended December 31,
	2009.

	On March 25, 2011, the terms of the convertible debenture
	receivable were renegotiated so that Aurcana was required to pay
	C$7,000,000 on July 15, 2011 and the remaining C$3,000,000 in quarterly
	instalments until July 15, 2012. The interest rate for the remainder of
	the arrangement was increased to 9%. This resulted in a recovery of the
	previous impairment of $2,400,000, recorded within other income (note 19).
	The Company retained the option to convert any portion of the remaining
	principal amount into Aurcana common shares at the deemed conversion price
	of C$1.52 per share (up to 1,980,000 shares) until July 15,

	During the year ended December 31,
	2011, the Company identified certain indicators that the mineral property asset
	constituting the Pirquitas mine, the CGU, may have been impaired. The indicators
	included a reduction in the mineral reserves and resources and an increase in
	the close down and restoration provision (note 13) which resulted in an increase
	to mineral properties. The Company therefore assessed the recoverable amount of
	this CGU and concluded that it exceeded the carrying value, so no impairment was
	recorded. The recoverable amount was estimated using a discounted cash flow
	approach based upon the most recent life-of-mine plan, and an estimated silver
	price based on market consensus, and a discount rate of 9%.

	On July 28, 2011, the Company completed the 100%
	acquisition of the San Luis property in Peru (70% interest held at
	December 31, 2010) from Esperanza Resources Corp. (&#147;Esperanza&#148;). The
	Company paid consideration of $17,865,000 in cash and transferred to
	Esperanza the 6,459,000 shares of Esperanza that it owned. In addition,
	under the terms of the agreement the Company will provide a 1% net smelter
	return royalty (&#147;NSR&#148;) on future production. The total fair value of the
	consideration paid to acquire the 30% interest held by Esperanza was
	$28,694,000, which includes transaction costs of $306,000. The carrying
	amount of the non-controlling interest in the San Luis project on the date
	of acquisition was $496,000. This transaction did not result in a change
	of control and therefore the Company recognized a decrease in
	non-controlling interest of $496,000 and a decrease in other reserves of
	$28,198,000 (note 16).

	At December 31, 2010, the convertible note was included
	in the carrying value of the investment in Pretium as this most accurately
	reflected the substance of the arrangement. The note was partially repaid
	on January 6, 2011, whereby the Company received gross proceeds of
	$18,083,000. On January 31, 2011, the balance of the note in the amount of
	$20,986,000 was converted into 3,625,500 common shares of Pretium at their
	fair value of $22,946,000, resulting in a $1,092,000 gain on settlement.
	The Company recognized transaction costs of $1,631,000 in the statement of
	income for the year ended December 31, 2011. The transaction costs and the
	gain on settlement of the note are recognized within the gain on sale of
	mineral property in the statement of income, as they are interrelated with
	the original sale transaction for the Snowfield and Brucejack
	properties.

	Pretium common shares by completing a secondary offering of 11,500,000

	and half of a warrant to acquire an additional Pretium common share for
	C$12.50 within twelve months. The Company received cash proceeds from this
	offering of $120,117,000 before transaction costs of $7,734,000. As a
	result of this transaction, the Company recognized a gain on partial
	disposal of its associate of $38,776,000 (an after-tax gain of
	$34,687,000). The warrants issued in the unit offering were recognized as
	a liability and are recorded at fair value (note 12). Following the
	closing of the offering, the Company&#146;s ownership interest in Pretium was
	28.86%.

	production stage. Production commenced at the mine on December 1, 2009, and as a
	result the Company has applied to the Argentine government to recover the
	applicable VAT. The Company believes that the balance is fully recoverable and
	has not provided an allowance.

	As part of its offering of Pretium shares on April 8,
	2011 (note 8), the Company issued 5,750,000 Pretium common share purchase
	warrants (the &#147;Pretium warrants&#148;). Each Pretium warrant is exercisable at
	a price of C$12.50 until April 7, 2012. Upon issuance of the Pretium
	warrants the Company recognized a liability of $7,500,000 in the statement
	of financial position and recognized transaction costs of $433,000 in the
	statement of income. The liability is recorded at FVTPL. The trading price
	of the Pretium warrants at December 31, 2011 was C$1.25. This price was
	unchanged from the trading price at inception, and therefore, there was no
	remeasurement effect on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year
	ended December 31, 2011 other than foreign exchange.

	The Company&#146;s close down and restoration provision
	relates to the restoration and closure of the Company&#146;s mining operations
	and projects under development (note 7). The provision is initially
	recorded at net present value, and subsequently re-measured at each
	reporting period. During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31,
	2011, the Company recorded a change in its estimate for close down and
	restoration from the preliminary findings of a mine closure plan for its
	Pirquitas mine in Argentina, that is scheduled for completion in 2012.
	This is a prospective change in estimate and had no impact on the
	Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
	There is considerable measurement uncertainty with a provision of this
	nature (note 2(u)) from the timing of cash flows, inflationary environment
	and impact of exchange rates.

	The repurchase price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes

	one-off grant of transitional PSUs, which vest after a two-year performance
	period. The vesting of these awards is based on the Company&#146;s total shareholder

	The Pirquitas mine has a fiscal stability agreement with
	the government of Argentina dating from 1998. In 2002, the government of
	Argentina implemented an export duty on concentrates that did not apply to
	companies with pre-existing fiscal stability agreements. In December
	2007, the National Customs Authority of Argentina levied an export duty of
	approximately 10% on concentrates for projects with fiscal stability
	agreements predating 2002. The Company has been advised that the project
	is subject to this export duty despite rights under the fiscal stability
	agreement from 1998. The legality of the export duty applied to silver
	concentrates has been challenged and is currently under review by the
	court in Argentina. In July 2010, the Company filed a claim in the
	provincial Argentina court for repayment of export duties paid on silver
	concentrates, and for an order to cease payment of the export duty until
	the matter was decided by the court. An order was granted effective
	September 29, 2010 to cease payment of the export duty on silver
	concentrates pending the decision of the courts, and in April 2011 a
	government appeal against this order was denied.

	Up to December 31, 2011, the Pirquitas mine had paid
	$6,649,000 in export duties against which it has filed for recovery. In
	accordance with the order to cease payment the Company has not been paying
	export duties on silver concentrate but continues to accrue duties in full
	until the outcome of the claim is known with certainty. At December 31,
	2011, the accrual totalled $13,101,000, and $10,538,000 has been included
	in cost of sales for the year. If this export duty is successfully
	overturned the benefit will be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
	Income for the full amount of paid and unpaid duty in the period recovery
	becomes virtually certain.

	The convertible notes (note 14) in
	certain circumstances are convertible at the request of the holders. In such an
	event the initial principal would be repayable in cash and any incremental value
	settled at the election of the Company in either cash or common shares, or a
	combination of the two. The potential dilutive impact of the shares is therefore
	only that portion of the Notes where the share price exceeds the conversion
	price of $43.33 per share. Given that at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010
	the share price was significantly below the conversion price an assumed
	conversion by holders would not have any dilution impact because the balance
	would be repaid in full in cash.

	The Company has identified its
	operating segments based on the information used by the President and Chief
	Executive Officer (who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker)
	to manage the business. The Company primarily manages its business by looking at
	individual extractive projects and typically segregates these projects between
	production, development and exploration. For reporting purposes all exploration
	and development projects have been aggregated into a single reportable segment
	&#145;exploration and development properties&#146; because they all have similar
	characteristics and none exceed the quantitative thresholds for individual
	disclosure. The only production property, the Pirquitas mine, is considered a
	single operating segment which derives its revenues from the sale of silver and
	zinc concentrates. The corporate division only earns income that is considered
	incidental to the activities of the Company and therefore does not meet the
	definition of an operating segment. The following reporting segments have been
	identified:

	Currency risk is the risk that the fair

	fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency rates. The Company&#146;s financial

</EFX_UNIDENTIFIED_TABLE>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Interest rate risk is the risk that the
	fair values or future cash flows of the Company&#146;s financial instruments will
	fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk mainly
	arises from the interest rate impact on our cash and cash equivalents because
	they are the only financial instrument the Company holds that earns interest
	based on variable market interest rates. The long-term convertible notes have
	fixed interest rates and are not exposed to fluctuations in interest rates; a
	change in interest rates would impact the fair value of the instruments, but
	because the notes are recorded at amortized cost there would be no impact on the
	financial results of the Company. The Company monitors its exposure to interest
	rates closely and has not entered into any derivative contracts to manage its
	risk.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As at December 31, 2011, the weighted
	average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents was 0.14% (2010 - 0.89%)
	. With other variables unchanged, a 1% increase in the interest rate would
	increase after tax net income by $2,340,000 (2010 - $450,000).

	Credit risk is the risk that a third
	party might fail to discharge its obligations under the terms of a financial

	investments.

	customer. However, the Company has not recorded an allowance against trade
	receivables because it is confident of the collectability based on the
	nature of its customer and all balances owed have been settled in full
	when due. In order to mitigate this risk, the Company ensures a minimum
	creditworthiness of customers, and has entered into sales agreements with
	additional customers in 2012.

	The Company also has credit risk through its significant

	The Company elected under IFRS 1 to
	deem the fair value of the Pirquitas mine as cost at January 1, 2010 (note
	2(a)). The fair value of the mine was determined to be $317,275,000 following a
	discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate of 10%. The resulting
	adjustment between the carrying value under Canadian GAAP and the deemed cost of
	$84,018,000 was charged to the opening accumulated deficit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In addition to the adjustment to the
	carrying value of the Pirquitas mine additional adjustments following the
	transition to IFRS were recorded. These relate to the close down and restoration
	provision (note 26 (c)(ii)), capitalized interest (note 26(c)(vi)) and deferred
	tax liabilities (note 26(c)(vii)). The impacts of these adjustments on the
	carrying value of the Pirquitas mine at January 1, 2010 are detailed below:

<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under Canadian GAAP asset retirement
	obligations for close down and decommissioning costs are measured at the initial
	date of recognition using a discounted cash flow analysis with the Company&#146;s
	credit-adjusted risk free interest rate. The liability (and corresponding asset)
	is only re-measured in the event of changes in the amount or timing of cash
	flows required to settle the obligation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	IFRS (IAS 37) requires initial
	measurement of the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the
	risk associated with the liability; furthermore the liability is required to be
	re-measured at each reporting date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As described in note 2(a), the Company
	elected to use the IFRS 1 transition exemption from full retrospective
	adjustment that would have been required under IFRIC 1. The Company re-measured
	the liability at the date of transition to IFRS and recorded an adjustment of
	$810,000 to the carrying value of the liability and to the carrying value of the
	corresponding property, plant and equipment asset, of which $720,000 related to
	Pirquitas.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	For the year ended December 31, 2010
	the Company recorded an adjustment of $713,000 to the carrying value of the
	liability and related mineral property asset, with a $76,000 impact on earnings.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company&#146;s accounting policy for
	share-based payments under Canadian GAAP was broadly consistent with the
	requirements of IFRS, however, under IFRS 2 the Company is required to make
	adjustments to the compensation expense recorded for estimates of non-market
	vesting conditions, such as stock options that are not expected to vest i.e.
	forfeited. The initial estimation of non-market vesting conditions is not
	mandatory under Canadian GAAP. As a result the Company&#146;s accounting policy
	choice was to make adjustments only when events occurred so that non-market
	vesting conditions were not met, such as when stock options were forfeited. The
	Company elected to apply the IFRS 1 transition exemption (note 2(a)), whereby
	adjustments were only required to be made to stock options that had been granted
	after November 7, 2002 and had not vested at the date of transition to IFRS.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The Company estimated the amount of stock
	options that would not vest by using historical data, the resulting impact at
	January 1, 2010 was insignificant but for the year ended December 31, 2010 the
	impact was a reduction to stock based compensation of $1,046,000, of which $991,000
	was credited to the statement of income and the balance of $52,000 to property,
	plant and equipment.

	The Company determined that three subsidiaries had a
	functional currency other than the US dollar, which under Canadian GAAP
	had been classified as being integrated operations. Those subsidiaries
	under Canadian GAAP were consolidated using the temporal method (i.e.
	monetary assets and liabilities translated at the current rate and non-
	monetary assets and liabilities at historic exchange rates with gains or
	losses being charged to income), whereas under IFRS those entities with
	non US dollar functional currencies are translated into US dollars using
	the current rate method (whereby all assets and liabilities are translated
	using the reporting date exchange rates with any gains or losses being
	recorded in equity).

	The net impact was an increase in mineral properties of
	$5,030,000, offset by a charge to currency translation adjustment (&#147;CTA&#148;).
	The Company also elected to take the IFRS 1 exemption to deem cumulative
	translation adjustments to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS.
	Hence all existing CTA balances and the impact of the above adjustments as
	of January 1, 2010 were recorded against the opening accumulated
	deficit.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As discussed in note 14, the Company
	issued $138,000,000 of convertible notes (&#147;Notes&#148;) in 2008. Under Canadian GAAP
	the Company accounted for the Notes as a split instrument allocating the value
	of the notes between the debt and equity components. The debt was valued using a
	discounted cash flow model, with the residual balance being allocated to equity.
	At initial recognition the transaction costs were allocated to the debt and
	equity components pro rata. The debt portion was designated as an &#145;other
	financial liability&#146;, those transaction costs allocated to the debt were
	expensed, and those allocated to equity were treated as a reduction of the value
	of the equity component. Subsequently, the difference in carrying value of the
	debt and its final redemption amount is recognized as accretion expense in the
	statement of income over the period to maturity using the effective interest
	rate method.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	There are two GAAP differences in
	relation to this instrument. Firstly, under Canadian GAAP the conversion feature
	is considered to be an equity instrument, but under IFRS it is considered as an
	embedded derivative liability due to the fact that if the holder elects to
	exercise their conversion option, the instrument can be cash-settled at the
	option of the Company. Secondly, under Canadian GAAP the debt component of the
	instrument was designated as an &#145;other financial liability&#146;, and it was
	similarly designated under IFRS. However, under IFRS, transaction costs relating
	to an instrument that is designated as an &#145;other financial liability&#146; must be
	netted against the carrying value of the instrument, whereas under Canadian GAAP
	the Company made an accounting policy election to expense those costs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	At initial recognition under IFRS,
	similar to Canadian GAAP, the fair value of the debt component and conversion
	option were estimated but under IFRS the conversion option was recognized as a
	derivative liability. Transaction costs incurred were allocated pro rata to the
	two components, again consistent with Canadian GAAP. For IFRS the debt has been
	designated as an &#145;other liability&#146;, which means that the instrument is recorded
	at amortized cost, net of transaction costs. Subsequently, the accounting is the
	same as Canadian GAAP whereby the instrument is accreted over an expected life
	of 5 years using the effective interest method.

	The accretion expense each reporting period under IFRS is
	greater than under Canadian GAAP due to the lower value attributed to the
	debt portion upon initial recognition, due to the fact that transaction
	costs are netted against the carrying value of the debt. Differences in
	accretion expense have been charged to the opening accumulated deficit at
	the date of transition. Also a proportion of the accretion was capitalized
	to the Pirquitas mineral property asset and as such the amount capitalized
	under IFRS differs from that under Canadian GAAP (note
	26(c)(vi)).

	The Company&#146;s accounting policy for
	capitalising borrowing costs during the construction of the Pirquitas mine was
	unchanged between Canadian GAAP and IFRS. However, owing to the change in
	accounting methodology for the Notes described in note 26(c)(v) above a greater
	amount of accretion expense was available for capitalisation. The Company
	retrospectively adjusted the accretion expense capitalized to mineral
	properties.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The impact was an increase in the
	mineral property asset of $797,000 at the date of transition to IFRS.
	Construction was completed prior to the transition to IFRS so there are no
	further GAAP differences recorded.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Under Canadian GAAP deferred tax
	liabilities were calculated following the acquisition of various mineral
	property assets. IFRS does not allow the recognition of deferred tax liabilities
	for temporary differences that arise in a transaction other than a business
	combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither the taxable nor
	accounting profit or loss. As a result deferred tax liabilities recognized on
	asset acquisitions under Canadian GAAP have been derecognized under IFRS and
	credited to the opening accumulated deficit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Non-monetary assets and liabilities of
	an entity are measured in its functional currency. If an entity&#146;s taxable income
	or loss is determined in a different currency, changes in exchange rate will
	give rise to a temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset or
	liability under IAS 12. Effectively, the carrying value of the non-monetary
	asset/liability (as measured in the functional currency based on historical
	exchange rates) is translated from the functional currency to the local currency
	at the current rate and compared to the tax value in the local currency. The
	resulting temporary difference (measured in the local currency) is multiplied by
	the appropriate tax rate to arrive at the deferred tax balance in the local
	currency. This deferred tax balance is then translated into the functional
	currency at the current rate and charged/credited to profit or loss.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The above result is different from
	Canadian GAAP which prohibits the recognition of deferred taxes for temporary
	differences caused by exchange gains and losses related to foreign non-monetary
	assets and liabilities that are remeasured into the functional currency using
	historical exchange rates.
<B>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The result of these differences was a
	reduction of $35,596,000 in the deferred tax liabilities recognized on the date
	of transition to IFRS, reflected in aggregate credits to mineral properties of
	$36,797,000 (of which $20,262,000 related to Pirquitas), and aggregate charges
	to opening accumulated deficit of $1,201,000. The impact on retained earnings in
	the year ended December 31, 2010 was a charge of $3,354,000.

	A GAAP difference also exists in respect of the treatment of the tax effects of share issuance costs. While a deferred tax asset for these costs is recognized under both standards, IFRS requires the benefit to be credited to
	equity regardless of the period it was recognized, while under Canadian GAAP the benefit is reflected in net income if recognized in a period subsequent to when the issuance costs were incurred. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2010,
	under Canadian GAAP an income tax recovery of &#36;5,109,000 relating to share issuance costs was credited to earnings, but under IFRS this recovery has been credited directly to share capital. The effect of this adjustment has been reflected in the
	reconciliation of shareholders&rsquo; equity as at December 31, 2010.

	Standard, Pretivm and the Underwriters the cash proceeds ultimately received by
	Silver Standard or Pretivm from this Agreement and the Related Agreements and

	Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the
