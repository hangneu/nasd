<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of orally administered, small
	molecule therapeutics targeting an area of RNA biology we refer to as post-transcriptional control. The letters "PTC" in our corporate name are an acronym for post-transcriptional control processes,
	which are the regulatory events that occur in cells during and after a messenger RNA is copied from DNA through the transcription process. We have discovered all of our compounds currently under
	development using our proprietary technologies. We plan to continue to develop these compounds both on our own and through selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical and
	biotechnology companies. We believe that systematically targeting post-transcriptional control processes represents an unexploited approach to drug discovery and development. Our internally discovered
	pipeline addresses multiple therapeutic areas, including rare disorders and oncology.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	lead product, Translarna
<SUP>
	TM
</SUP>
	(ataluren) received marketing authorization from the European Commission, or EC, in August 2014 for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory
	patients age 5&nbsp;years and over in the 31 member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA. nmDMD is a rare, life threatening disorder. The marketing authorization was primarily based upon the
	safety and efficacy results of our 48-week, 174-patient Phase&nbsp;2b double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with
	nmDMD completed in 2009, or the Phase&nbsp;2b trial.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	marketing authorization in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the
	risk-benefit balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment. Our marketing authorization was further conditioned on our ability to complete our global, confirmatory
	Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial in nmDMD, which we refer to as ACT DMD, and submit the final report, including additional efficacy and safety data from the trial. We submitted this final report to the
	EMA in January 2016 and we have requested that the condition to our marketing authorization be removed and that a full marketing authorization be granted. We expect that the EMA's Committee for
	Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, will issue a recommendation regarding this request in mid-2016. See "Item&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Business&#151;Regulation in the European Union" and "Risk
	Factors&#151;Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates" for further detail regarding the annual EMA reassessment, including a description of the
	risk-benefit balance.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	June 2014, we initiated a reimbursed expanded access program, or EAP program, for Translarna for nmDMD patients in selected territories in the EEA and recorded our first sales of
	Translarna in the third quarter of 2014 pursuant to the EAP program. In December 2014, we recorded our first commercial sales in Germany. As of the date of this filing, Translarna is available in 23
	countries on a commercial basis or pursuant to the EAP program. We expect to expand our launch activities across the EEA pursuant to the marketing authorization granted by the EMA throughout 2016 and
	future years, subject to continued renewal of our marketing authorization following annual EMA reassessments and successful completion of pricing and reimbursement negotiations. Concurrently, we
	plan to continue to pursue EAP programs in select countries where those mechanisms exist, both within the EEA and in other countries.

	was
	not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Specifically, we were notified in the letter that, in the view of the FDA, both the Phase&nbsp;2b and Phase&nbsp;3 ACT DMD trials were
	negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled
	patients. We need further discussion with FDA to understand their current perspective on our subgroup analysis. In addition, the FDA noted that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding
	the abuse potential of Translarna. While other comments and requests are noted in the letter as items to be addressed if the NDA is resubmitted, the FDA specified that they were not related to its
	refusal to file our NDA. See "Item&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Business&#151;Marketing authorization matters for Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy&#151;United States" and
	"Item&nbsp;1A.&nbsp;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates" for further detail regarding the Refuse to File letter and the related

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	October 2015, we announced results from ACT DMD. In the overall intent-to-treat, or ITT, study population, the primary endpoint of change from baseline at week 48 in the 6-minute walk
	test or 6MWT, which we also refer to as 6-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, showed a 15 meter benefit in favor of Translarna, which did not meet statistical significance (p=0.213). However, we believe
	that the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data across our two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (ACT DMD and our prior Phase&nbsp;2b trial, Study 007), provide substantial
	evidence of the effectiveness of Translarna and demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Importantly, a benefit of 47 meters (nominal p=0.007) was observed
	in the pre-specified patient population with baseline 6MWD of 300 to 400 meters, which is in line with our prior experience in the Phase&nbsp;2b trial and is consistent with the evolving
	understanding of the natural history of the 6MWT in DMD patients. Translarna also showed a benefit over placebo in the 300 to 400 meter baseline 6MWD population across key secondary and tertiary
	endpoints, including timed function tests (10 meter run/walk, four stair climb, four stair descend) and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment test. In addition, a pre-specified meta-analysis of
	combined data from ACT DMD and Phase&nbsp;2b ambulatory decline phase patients, involving a total of 291 patients, demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in favor of Translarna in the
	primary endpoint of 21 meters (p&nbsp;= 0.015) and in key secondary endpoints. The Phase&nbsp;2b ambulatory decline phase patients includes the patients from our randomized, double-blind, placebo
	controlled, Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial in patients with nmDMD who would have met the enrollment criteria of ACT DMD.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	continue to believe that the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data across our two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (ACT DMD and our prior Phase&nbsp;2b
	trial, Study 007), including pre-specified analyses as well as retrospective and subgroup analyses that we have performed, provide strong support for concluding that Translarna is active and showed
	clinically meaningful benefits over placebo in these trials. However, we did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in either trial with the pre specified level of statistical significance and, as
	noted above, on February&nbsp;22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA regarding our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. There is also substantial risk that the EMA and
	regulators in other territories may not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials. For further discussion of ACT DMD, see
	"Item&nbsp;1. Business&#151;Completed clinical trials of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy." See "Item&nbsp;1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to the

	fibrosis caused by nonsense mutations, or nmCF. We refer to this trial as ACT CF. We anticipate top line data from ACT CF will be available in early 2017.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
	the third quarter of 2015, we submitted a variation to our marketing authorization of Translarna in the EEA, described above, to request approval of the addition of Translarna for
	the treatment of nmCF. We are currently responding to the CHMP's request for supplementary information as part of the CHMP's review process and expect a recommendation from the CHMP in mid-2016. Our
	variation submission is primarily based upon the safety and efficacy results of our randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial evaluating the long-term safety and
	efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmCF completed in 2011, which we refer to as our prior Phase&nbsp;3 trial. We believe that the collective data from our prior Phase&nbsp;3 trial, including
	retrospective and subgroup analyses that we have performed, provide strong support for concluding that Translarna was active and showed clinically meaningful improvements over placebo, however, we did
	not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in this trial. Approval of the variation to our marketing authorization will depend on the EMA's assessment of the relative benefits and risks of approval. We
	may not be able to demonstrate the required relative risk-benefit profile and there is substantial risk that the EMA will not grant us a variation approving Translarna for the treatment of nmCF. If
	approved, we expect that the EMA will require us, as a post-approval measure, to provide comprehensive clinical data from ACT CF to the EMA. In addition, such authorization, if granted, will continue
	to be subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission, following reassessment by the EMA, unless and until we are granted a marketing authorization no longer subject to specific
	conditions for our primary marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna, which we refer to as a "full marketing authorization". See "Item&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Business&#151;Regulation in the
	European Union" for further detail regarding the variation process and "Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our
	Product and Product Candidates" for further detail regarding the annual EMA reassessment, including a description of the risk benefit balance.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
	on its understood mechanism of action, we believe that Translarna may have benefit in the treatment of patients with any genetic disorder that arises as a result of a nonsense
	mutation. We are pursuing proof-of-concept studies for Translarna in additional indications: mucopolysaccharidosis type&nbsp;I caused by nonsense mutation, or nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia,
	and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5. See "Business&#151;Translarna for additional indications", for additional information on these studies.

	collectively as Roche, and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, or SMA Foundation. Two compounds are currently in clinical development within the SMA program, RG7800 and RG7916. The most advanced
	compound, RG7800, is the subject of a Phase&nbsp;2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial called Moonfish in adult and pediatric patients with SMA. Dosing in the Moonfish trial was
	suspended in April 2015 and the trial was placed on clinical hold to investigate a non-clinical safety finding observed in a longer-term animal study. The initiation of a Phase&nbsp;1 study for
	RG7916 in healthy volunteers to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics was announced in January 2016. Upon completion of this study, we and our collaboration
	partners expect to utilize data from this Phase&nbsp;1 study to compare the profiles of the RG7800 and RG7916 compounds to determine the best path forward for our SMA program. See

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We discovered Translarna by applying our technologies to identify molecules that promote or enhance the suppression of nonsense

	the production of full-length, functional proteins. We believe that Translarna interacts with the ribosome, which is the component of the cell that decodes the mRNA molecule and manufactures proteins,
	to enable the ribosome to read through premature nonsense stop signals on mRNA and allow the cell to produce a full-length, functional protein. As a result, we believe that Translarna has the
	potential to be an important therapy for nmDMD, nmCF, nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia, nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5, and other genetic disorders for which a

	Nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD)

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muscular dystrophies are genetic disorders involving progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most
	common and one of the most severe types of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when a mutation in the dystrophin gene prevents the cell from making a functional dystrophin protein.
	Dystrophin is a muscle membrane
	associated protein and is critical to the structural and membrane stability of muscle fibers in skeletal, diaphragm and heart muscle. The absence of normally functioning dystrophin results in muscle
	fragility, such that muscle injury occurs when muscles contract or stretch during normal use. As muscle damage progresses, connective tissue and fat replace muscle fibers, resulting in inexorable
	muscle weakness.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
	the dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs almost exclusively in young boys. According to Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne
	muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 1 in 3,500 live male births. Based on this prevalence data, we estimate that Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects a total of approximately 15,000 boys and
	adolescents in the United States. Based on data from Orphanet, a public reference portal for information on rare disorders and orphan drugs, we estimate that Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects a
	total of approximately 19,000 boys and adolescents in the European Union. Genetic tests are available to determine if a patient's Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a nonsense mutation. Based on
	information from Prior, et al. (1995) in the American Journal of Human Genetics, we estimate that a nonsense mutation is the cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in approximately 13% of patients.
	Overall, we estimate that the potential opportunity for a treatment for nonsense mutation DMD is approximately 7,000 patients worldwide including approximately 2,000 patients in the United States and
	approximately 5,000 patients outside of the United States, including the European Union, Latin America, Japan and Australia. nmDMD is an ultra-rare, life threatening disorder. Without treatment,
	patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically lose walking ability by their early teens, require ventilation support in their late teens and, eventually, die due to heart and lung failure. The
	average age of death for Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients is in their mid-twenties.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	marketing authorization in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the
	risk-benefit balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment, as well as our satisfaction of other conditions and obligations. We plan to seek to renew the marketing
	authorization on an annual basis until a marketing authorization that is not subject to any specific conditions is granted, if ever.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	August 2015, the EMA renewed the marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD for one year. In January 2016, we fulfilled the principal condition of the marketing
	authorization when we submitted the results of ACT DMD to the EMA. In connection with our submission of the ACT DMD report to the EMA, we requested that this condition to our marketing authorization
	be removed and that a full marketing authorization be granted. We currently anticipate the CHMP will make its recommendation to the EMA with respect to this request in mid-2016.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
	a parallel track, while the EMA considers our request to remove the condition to our marketing authorization in the EEA, we submitted our second annual renewal request to the EMA in
	February 2016. We expect, if granted, the renewal would be effective August 2016 for a one-year period. In connection with its review of our renewal application, the EMA will also take into account
	the results of ACT DMD as well as our request, described above, to have the primary condition removed from our current marketing authorization.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	connection with our requests to the EMA described above, the EMA may recommend the granting of a marketing authorization that is no longer subject to any further specific conditions,
	may recommend the imposition of new conditions to our marketing authorization, or may make other
	recommendations. Evaluation of the new data submitted to the EMA in our ACT DMD report may change the EMA's view of the risk-benefit balance of the marketing authorization. There is substantial risk
	that the EMA will not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials. If the EMA does not view the results of ACT DMD as favorable, if we
	fail to satisfy our obligations under the marketing authorization, or if it is determined that the balance of risks and benefits of using Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD changes materially, the
	European Commission could, at the EMA's recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require additional clinical trials.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
	if we are granted a marketing authorization that is no longer subject to specific obligations, we would continue to be required to follow renewal requirements in line with
	applicable regulations in the EEA. Generally, a marketing authorization in the EEA that is not subject to conditions is valid for five years, and is renewable upon application. If renewed following
	this five year period, the marketing authorization would then be valid for an unlimited period, unless the EMA or other competent authority decides to require an additional five-year renewal
	requirement.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	the marketing authorization holder, we are obligated to monitor the use of Translarna for nmDMD to detect, assess and take required action with respect to information that could
	impact Translarna's safety profile and to report this information, via pharmacovigilance submissions, to the EMA. Following its assessment of these submissions, the EMA can recommend to the European
	Commission actions ranging from the continued maintenance of the marketing authorization to its withdrawal.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	disclosed on the morning of February&nbsp;23, 2016, on the evening of February&nbsp;22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA regarding our NDA, for Translarna
	for the treatment of nmDMD. The FDA stated in the Refuse to File letter that our NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically,
	we were notified in the letter that, in the view of the FDA, both the Phase&nbsp;2b and Phase&nbsp;3 ACT DMD trials were negative and do not provide substantial
	evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. We need further discussion with
	FDA to understand their current perspective on our subgroup analysis. In addition, the FDA noted that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. While
	other comments and requests are noted in the letter as items to be addressed if the NDA is resubmitted, the FDA specified that they were not related to its refusal to file our NDA.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	continue to believe that the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data across our two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials provide substantial evidence of the
	effectiveness of Translarna and demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. We disagree with the manner in which our data has been characterized in the Refuse
	to File letter and we are initiating dialogue with the FDA to discuss and clarify the matters set forth in the letter and determine our best path forward.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	also believe we supplied adequate information with respect to potential for abuse in our submission. As noted in our NDA, in our review of our in vitro and in vivo non-clinical data
	as well as the clinical safety database, we have not seen evidence of central nervous system effects associated with abuse potential. Therefore, further studies to assess abuse potential in animals or
	humans were not performed. For additional information with respect to the safety profile of Translarna in our ACT DMD and Phase&nbsp;2b trials, see "Item&nbsp;1. Business&#151;Completed
	clinical trials of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until
	we are able to meet with the FDA to obtain further clarity on the matters set forth in its letter, we are unable to fully assess our potential path forward for Translarna for the
	treatment of nmDMD in the United States, including whether we will submit a new or revised NDA and the agency's willingness to review, and the outcome of, any such submission. As a result, we are
	unable to estimate the timing or potential for a launch of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States. There is substantial risk that, notwithstanding any further dialogue we may be
	able to initiate with the agency, the FDA will continue to disagree with our interpretation of our trial results and we may be required to perform additional clinical and non-clinical trials at
	significant cost, which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission. Any such requirement for additional trials would most likely result in our inability to sell Translarna in the
	United States for a significant period of time.

	dispute resolution request concerning the NDA. We requested review of the issues related to the FDA's refusal to file the NDA and a prospective resubmission of the NDA with updated information and

	marketing authorization requests for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in additional territories, using both internal and external resources.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	have been making Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD available through reimbursed early access programs, or EAP programs, in selected countries where
	funded named patient or cohort programs exist, both within the EEA and in other territories. Many of these programs also reference the EMA's determinations with respect to our marketing authorization
	in the EEA. As of today, Translarna is available under EAP or similar styled programs in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Scotland, Singapore, Spain,
	Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. Generally, EAP programs allow for access to Translarna pursuant to a named patient program, under which a physician requests access to Translarna on behalf of the
	specific, or "named" patient or pursuant to a cohort program, which allows for a broader temporary authorization for use for nmDMD meeting the inclusion criteria. Our EAP programs are named patient or
	similar styled programs in all territories other than France and Italy, which are cohort programs.

	Background&#151;Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial of Translarna for
	nmDMD
</U>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	October 2015, we announced results from ACT DMD, also referred to as Study 020, our Phase&nbsp;3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week clinical trial
	to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy caused by nonsense mutations, or nmDMD. ACT DMD involved 228 patients at 53 sites across 18 countries.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the overall intent-to-treat, or ITT, study population, the primary endpoint of change from baseline at week 48 in the 6-minute walk test or 6MWT, which we also refer to as 6-minute
	walk distance, or 6MWD, showed a 15 meter benefit in favor of Translarna, which did not meet statistical significance.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	continue to believe that the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data across our two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (ACT DMD and our prior Phase&nbsp;2b
	trial, Study 007), including pre-specified analyses as well as retrospective and subgroup analyses that we have performed, provide strong support for concluding that Translarna is active and showed
	clinically meaningful benefits over placebo in these trials. However, we did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in either trial with the pre specified level of statistical significance and on
	February&nbsp;22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA regarding our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD stating that, in the view of the FDA, our NDA was not
	sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically,
	we were notified in the Refuse to File letter that, in the view of the FDA, both the Phase&nbsp;2b and Phase&nbsp;3 ACT DMD trials were negative and do not provide
	substantial evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. We need further
	discussion with FDA to understand their current perspective on our subgroup analysis.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, the FDA noted that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. While other comments and requests are noted in the letter as
	items to be addressed if the NDA is resubmitted, the FDA specified that they were not related to its refusal to file our NDA. See "Item&nbsp;1. Business&#151;Marketing authorization matters
	for Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy&#151;United States" for additional information with respect to our history of interactions with the FDA with respect to
	Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
	is also substantial risk that in addition to the matters discussed above, the EMA and regulators in other territories may not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT
	DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials.

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of ACT DMD confirmed the favorable safety profile of Translarna seen in the Phase&nbsp;2b trial.
	Translarna
	was generally well tolerated in our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial. There were two study discontinuations due to adverse events, including one in the Translarna arm
	(constipation) and one in the placebo arm (disease progression). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common adverse events in this trial were vomiting
	(20.4% overall), nasopharyngitis (20.0%), headache (18.3%), and fall (17.8%). These events were generally balanced across treatment arms and are typical of pediatric illnesses and/or patients with
	DMD. Adverse events with at least a 10% incidence in either treatment arm that were seen with increased frequency from the placebo group to the Translarna 40&nbsp;mg dose group were vomiting (18.3%
	for placebo, 23.6% for the Translarna 40&nbsp;mg group), nasopharyngitis (19.1% for placebo, 20.9% for the Translarna 40&nbsp;mg group), fall (17.4% for placebo, 18.3% for the Translarna
	40&nbsp;mg group), cough (11.3% for placebo, 16.5% for the Translarna 40&nbsp;mg group) diarrhea (8.7% for placebo, 17.4% for the Translarna 40&nbsp;mg group), and pyrexia (10.4% for placebo,
	13.9% for the Translarna 40&nbsp;mg group). An overview of adverse events in this trial is shown in the table below.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Specified Analyses.
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistical analysis plan submitted to the FDA for ACT DMD set forth pre-specified analyses of efficacy to
	be conducted,
	including subgroups of patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters and patients with baseline 6MWD of greater than or equal to 300 and less than 400 meters, which we refer to as our key
	subgroups.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	pre-specification of our key subgroups was scientifically justified based upon knowledge of the biology of the disease and the evolving understanding of the natural history of the
	six minute walk test in DMD patients. We considered the pre-specified less than 350 meter baseline 6MWD population as a key subgroup based on the knowledge that 350 meters represents a transition
	point for patients towards a more rapid decline in walking ability as supported by analysis from our Phase&nbsp;2b trial. Furthermore, we considered the pre-specified 300 to 400 meter baseline 6MWD
	population as a key subgroup based on an increasing understanding of the sensitivity limitations of the six minute walk test as an endpoint in 48-week studies. Natural history data suggests that the
	6MWT may not be the optimal tool to demonstrate efficacy in patients with either a baseline 6MWD of less than 300 meters, as these patients have significant muscle loss as monitored by magnetic
	resonance spectroscopy and are at high risk for losing ambulation regardless of treatment, or in high walking patients, such as those with a baseline 6MWD at or greater than 400 meters, as these
	patients are likely to remain stable over a 48&nbsp;week testing period.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
	defining these key subgroups, we thereby also defined corresponding complement subgroups of patients with baseline 6MWD greater than or equal to 350 meters, greater than or equal to
	400 meters,
	and less than 300 meters. We also pre-specified a meta-analysis of the combined results from ACT DMD and the Phase&nbsp;2b ambulatory decline phase patients.

	Pre-specified sub-group analysis
</U>
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw strong evidence of clinical benefit in the pre-specified subgroup of patients
	with baseline 6MWD between 300 and 400 meters. Specifically, we observed a benefit in Translarna-treated patients of 47 meters (nominal p=0.007) in the 6MWT in this subgroup. This benefit was
	consistent with an observed benefit of 49 meters (nominal p=0.026) in our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial in the 300 to 400 meters baseline 6MWD population. We also saw clinically meaningful benefit
	for Translarna over placebo in each of the timed function tests, including observed results in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.1 seconds; nominal p=0.066), time to climb four stairs (3.6 seconds;
	nominal p=0.003), and time to descend four stairs (4.3 seconds; nominal p&lt;0.001). The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.79 (nominal p=0.418) for 10% 6MWD worsening. In
	addition, a benefit of 4.5 points over placebo (nominal p=0.041) was observed in the NSAA test, which we believe is clinically meaningful. We believe that the benefits observed in this key
	pre-specified subgroup support the use of the 6MWT in the patients with a walking ability in the 300 to 400 meters range and the understanding that the reliability of the 6MWT over a 48&nbsp;week
	period was limited at both the lower and upper ends of our 6MWD enrollment range.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters, we observed a benefit of 24 meters (nominal p=0.210) in favor of Translarna in the 6MWT. An analysis of
	the results from our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial in the less than 350 meters baseline 6MWD population, defined post-hoc, demonstrated a 68 meter benefit in the 6MWT (nominal p=0.006). In the timed
	function tests for the subgroup of ACT DMD patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters, we observed benefits for Translarna over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.3 seconds; nominal
	p=0.033), time to climb four stairs (4.2 seconds; nominal p=0.019) and time to descend four stairs (4.0 seconds; nominal p=0.007).

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	described above, we believe the 6MWT lacks sensitivity to detect a clinical effect in patients with baseline less than 300 meters in a 48-week trial. However, the timed function tests
	trended in favor of patients treated with Translarna with a baseline 6MWD below 300 meters, including observed benefit over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.5 seconds; nominal p=0.066), time
	to climb four stairs (2.4 seconds; nominal p=0.790), and time to descend four stairs (2.1 seconds; nominal p=0.595). We believe the positive trends in this population reflect that short muscle burst
	activity tests may be a better clinical measure for patients that are at a more advanced stage of disease progression. Consistent with the natural history of ambulatory DMD patients with 6MWD greater
	than 400 meters, which indicates stability in walking ability over a 48&nbsp;week period, we observed no meaningful difference in 6MWT between patient groups. Similarly, we observed no meaningful
	difference in 6MWT between patient groups with baseline 6MWD greater than 350 meters.

	significant efficacy outcome in the 6MWD in the meta-analysis, despite the significant variability in baseline 6MWD among patients in both ACT DMD and the Phase&nbsp;2b ambulatory decline phase, due

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2010, we announced the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose ranging Phase&nbsp;2b
	clinical trial
	evaluating the long term efficacy and safety of Translarna in patients with nmDMD as confirmed by gene sequencing. We conducted this clinical trial in 174 patients in 11 countries. The primary
	objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of Translarna on ambulation using 6-minute walk distance at week 48 of the trial compared to baseline as the primary efficacy endpoint. Supportive
	analyses of ambulation consisted of the proportion of patients with at least 10% worsening in 6-minute walk distance at week 48 of the trial compared to baseline and time to persistent 6-minute walk
	distance 10% worsening from baseline. Multiple additional secondary and exploratory endpoints, including, among others, tests of muscle function based on time to climb four stairs, descend four
	stairs, run/walk 10 meters and stand from supine, were monitored for the primary purpose of gaining a greater understanding of clinical trial design in DMD. We assessed safety through collection of
	adverse event information, measurement of laboratory parameters and performance of electrocardiograms, or ECGs. We also evaluated study drug compliance and Translarna plasma concentrations.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients
	enrolled in this trial were at least five years of age, had the ability at baseline to walk at least 75 meters unassisted during a 6-minute walk test, had onset of disease
	signs/symptoms prior to age nine, had elevated creatine kinase levels, and had ongoing difficulty with walking. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had a prior or ongoing clinically
	significant illness, had a positive hepatitis B or hepatitis C test or had recently used systemic aminoglycosides. Patients receiving corticosteroid therapy were required to have initiated therapy
	more than six months prior to enrollment
	and to be on a stable dosing regimen for at least three months prior to entering the trial. The trial protocol specified a clinic visit every six weeks to assess efficacy and safety and an interim
	laboratory visit every three weeks for the first 24&nbsp;weeks of the trial. The treatment duration was 48&nbsp;weeks.

	pre-specified statistical analysis plan, resulting in what we refer to as a corrected ITT analysis.

	Our pre-specified statistical model used to calculate the p-value and significance of the trial results omitted a specific statistical
	term designed to address the potential relationship between the 6-minute walk distance results at baseline and at each subsequent patient visit. As has now become standard practice in analyses of
	repeated-measures data, we adjusted our statistical model to add this statistical term in preparing the corrected ITT analysis.

	Because the 6-minute walk distance data were non-normally distributed, our pre-specified analysis used rank-transformed data in which
	the 6-minute walk distance values for each patient were ordered from smallest to largest and ranked from one to 174. However, ranking the data in this way did not fully reflect the large variability
	as measured in meters that we observed in the original 6-minute walk distance data. In the corrected ITT analysis, we used a re-randomization test, rather than rank transformation of the data, to
	address non-normality of the trial data. This re-randomization test allowed analysis of the 6-minute walk distance results in meters, rather than ranking the results relative to one another, to more
	accurately reflect the large variability in walking distances.

	Two patients had lower limb injuries after screening but prior to their baseline assessment. These injuries substantially affected
	their walking ability and led to aberrantly low baseline 6-minute walk distance values that did not accurately reflect their pre-treatment ambulatory ability. These baseline 6-minute walk tests were
	incorrectly classified as valid by the investigative site, and the resulting data should not have been included in the ITT analysis. In the corrected ITT analysis, we replaced the baseline values for
	these two patients with their valid screening values.

	the corrected ITT analysis, the difference between the 40 mg group and placebo in mean change in 6-minute walk distance over 48&nbsp;weeks was 31.3 meters. We observed clear
	separation between the 40 mg group and placebo, with the difference between the arms increasingly favoring the 40 mg group over time. The resulting nominal p-value for the comparison of mean change in
	6- minute walk distance from baseline to week 48 for the 40 mg group versus placebo was 0.0281. However, because two dose levels were compared to placebo, we were required to apply a multiplicity
	adjustment, which yielded a final adjusted p-value of 0.0561 for the 40 mg group versus placebo.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
	we believe that our additional analyses of the trial results were warranted, a retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results can result in the introduction of
	bias if the analysis is inappropriately tailored or influenced by knowledge of the data and actual results. In addition, nominal p-values cannot be compared to the benchmark p-value of 0.05 to
	determine statistical significance without being adjusted for the testing of multiple dose groups or analyses of subgroups. Because of these limitations, regulatory authorities typically give greatest
	weight to results from pre- specified analyses and adjusted p-values and less weight to results from post-hoc, retrospective analyses and nominal p-values.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients in the 40 mg group trended better than the placebo group in several of the secondary endpoints tracked

	trial, however the trial was not powered to detect statistically significant differences in secondary endpoints. Patients in the 40 mg group and exceeded the clinically meaningful threshold of 1.5
	seconds for stair-climbing and stair- descending in the ITT analysis and for running/walking in the corrected ITT analysis. In a supine to stand test, we did not observe any difference between
	Translarna and placebo. Other secondary endpoints showed trends favoring patients treated with Translarna, but at levels below a threshold considered to be clinically meaningful, including: muscle
	strength (tested through myometric evaluations), frequency of falls (based on patients/caregiver notation), and health related quality of life and treatment satisfaction (based on patient reports).

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translarna was generally well tolerated at both dose levels in our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial. There were no
	study
	discontinuations due to adverse events. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Investigators' attributions of drug-related adverse effects were generally similar
	across the placebo and Translarna arms. The most common adverse events in this trial were vomiting (46.6% overall), headache (29.3%), diarrhea (24.1%), nasopharyngitis (20.7%), fever (19.0%), cough
	(19.0%) and upper abdominal pain (17.8%). These events were generally balanced across treatment arms and are typical of pediatric illnesses. Adverse events with at least a 10% incidence in any
	treatment arm that were seen with increased frequency from the placebo group to the Translarna 40&nbsp;mg dose group to the Translarna 80&nbsp;mg dose group were nausea (12.3% for placebo, 14.0%

	Phase&nbsp;2a clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD

</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	October 2007, we announced the results of an open label Phase&nbsp;2a clinical trial evaluating Translarna in 38 patients with nmDMD. The primary
	objective of this trial was to obtain indications of pharmacological activity. The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial was the
	change from baseline measurement of dystrophin levels in a muscle in the foot known as the extensor digitorum brevis. nmDMD patients enrolled in this trial were at least five years of age, had
	increased levels of serum creatine kinase, or CK, and had absent or diminished dystrophin protein on muscle biopsy. All participants in the trial received Translarna treatment for 28&nbsp;days at
	one of three varying doses (12&nbsp;mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day and 80 mg/kg/day). In this trial, Translarna induced a mean 11.0% increase in muscle dystrophin expression over the 28&nbsp;days of
	treatment, with 23 of the 38 patients (61%) showing an increase from baseline. We observed serum CK reductions in 35 of the 38 patients (92%) at the end of treatment. With cessation of Translarna
	treatment, mean serum CK concentrations reverted toward baseline. Changes in myometry scores and timed function tests were small and not statistically significant with 28&nbsp;days of Translarna
	treatment. Anecdotal reports from the parents and teachers of several boys noted evidence of greater activity, increased endurance and less fatigue during Translarna administration. Pharmacokinetic
	results from this trial indicated that both the 40 mg/kg/day and the 80 mg/kg/day dose regimens achieved plasma concentrations of Translarna that were predicted to have a therapeutic effect, based on
	preclinical data. The 12 mg/kg/day regimen did not consistently achieve these levels, and as a result we did not include this dosing regimen in our subsequent Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial.

	Nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis (nmCF)
</I>
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cystic fibrosis is among the most common life-threatening genetic disorders worldwide. It is caused by a mutation in the DNA that
	results in either the absence or very
	low levels of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, protein. Cystic fibrosis results in the body producing abnormally thick and sticky mucus that clogs multiple organs,
	including the lungs, pancreas and liver. Cystic fibrosis leads to progressive loss of lung function, potentially life-threatening lung infections, permanent pancreatic damage and malnutrition. The
	average age of death for cystic fibrosis patients is approximately 27&nbsp;years.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According
	to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, cystic fibrosis occurs in approximately one of every 3,500 live births in the United States, with approximately 1,000 new cases diagnosed
	each year in the United States. Commercially available genetic testing can determine if a patient's cystic fibrosis is caused by a nonsense mutation. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the
	disease affects approximately 30,000 adults and children in the United States. Based on data from the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis, we believe the disease affects between approximately 37,000 and 42,000
	adults and children in the European Union. Based on information from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, we estimate that nonsense mutations are the cause of cystic fibrosis in approximately 10% of
	patients, or approximately 3,000 patients in the United States and approximately 3,700 to 4,200 patients in the European Union.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutations
	causing cystic fibrosis are categorized in five different classes, Class&nbsp;I through Class&nbsp;V. Class&nbsp;I consists of nonsense mutations and is the most severe
	because there is absence of CFTR production and no CFTR on the surface of the lung cells. Patients from six to 18&nbsp;years of age with two Class&nbsp;I mutations, one on each of a pair of genes,
	have on average 10% lower forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV
<SUB>
	1
</SUB>
	, measures than patients with two Class&nbsp;II mutations. FEV
<SUB>
	1
</SUB>
	is a measure of the volume of air
	that has been exhaled at the end of the first second of forced expiration. Translarna targets Class&nbsp;I mutations. Class&nbsp;II mutations are targeted by corrector drugs, which promote the
	production or movement of CFTR protein from within the cell to the cell surface. In contrast, the milder mutations, Class&nbsp;III, IV and V, are targeted by potentiator drugs, which enhance the
	effect of abnormal CFTR that is already present on the cell surface.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
	is currently no marketed therapy approved to correct defective CFTR production and function in patients with nmCF. For nmCF patients, available treatments do not address the
	underlying cause of the disease and are designed only to alleviate the symptoms of the disease. These treatments include chest physical therapy to clear the thick mucus from the lungs, antibiotics to
	treat lung infections and a mucus-thinning drug designed to reduce the number of lung infections and improve lung function. In addition, the majority of cystic fibrosis patients take pancreatic enzyme
	supplements to assist with food absorption in digestion.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enrollment for ACT CF, our second global, confirmatory Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial of Translarna for patients with nmCF, was
	completed in November 2015. ACT CF was initiated in the second quarter of 2014 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Translarna in patients with nmCF and is a randomized, double-blind,
	placebo-controlled, study of Translarna in patients six years of age or older with nmCF not receiving chronic inhaled aminoglycosides. We have enrolled approximately 280 patients in ACT CF and expect
	to have initial, top-line data available in early 2017.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

	. Percent of predicted FEV
<SUB>

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	ACT CF trial protocol specifies certain key inclusion criteria for patients enrolling in the trial including that the patient must be at least six years of age, have sweat chloride

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	ACT CF trial protocol provides for the exclusion of patients from the trial if, among other things, they are receiving chronic inhaled aminoglycoside antibiotics or have used
	aminoglycosides within 28&nbsp;days prior to screening, have recently been treated with intravenous antibiotics, have major complications of lung disease, or have previously received Translarna

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study

	and chronic use of inhaled antibiotics.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	study population and outcome measures that we are using in ACT CF are based on, and reflect our analysis of the results of, our completed Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial for the
	treatment of nmCF, including data regarding relative change from baseline in %-predicted FEV
<SUB>
	1
</SUB>
	, and other earlier work. We believe that the data from this trial showed a positive trend
	favoring Translarna versus placebo on lung function in patients not receiving chronic inhaled tobramycin. We believe the outcomes observed in multiple endpoints between the subgroup of patients who
	were not prescribed chronic inhaled tobramycin and the subgroup of patients who were prescribed chronic inhaled tobramycin as well as post-hoc in vitro testing showing the interference of
	aminoglycoside antibiotics with Translarna activity support the hypothesis that inhaled tobramycin may interfere with Translarna's mechanism of action. Specifically, in patients not receiving chronic
	inhaled tobramycin in our completed Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, we observed a difference in mean relative change from baseline in %-predicted FEV
<SUB>
	1
</SUB>
	at week 48 of 5.7% favoring Translarna
	(nominal p=0.008), consistent with the targeted treatment effect size. Patients receiving chronic inhaled tobramycin did not show a benefit for Translarna compared to placebo in
	%-predicted FEV
<SUB>
	1
</SUB>
	. In contrast, the treatment effect was similar in patients receiving colistin or aztreonam compared to patients not receiving colistin or aztreonam.
	Additionally, patients not receiving chronic inhaled tobramycin had a 41% lower pulmonary exacerbation rate on Translarna than placebo (nominal p=0.005). Patients receiving chronic inhaled torbramycin
	did not show a benefit in pulmonary exacerbation rate on Translarna as compared to placebo.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly,
	to focus on the patient population that we believe can most readily demonstrate the effect of Translarna, patients receiving chronic inhaled aminoglycoside antibiotics or
	who have used aminoglycosides within 28&nbsp;days prior to screening are not eligible to participate in ACT CF.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval
	of the marketing authorization variation by the European Commission will depend on the EMA's assessment of the relative benefits and risks of approval of Translarna for the
	treatment of nmCF and our ability to provide comprehensive clinical data from a confirmatory trial, such as ACT CF. We may not be able to demonstrate the required relative risk-benefit profile and
	there is substantial risk that the EMA will not grant us a variation approving Translarna for the treatment of nmCF. If approved, we expect that the EMA will require us, as a post-approval measure, to
	provide comprehensive clinical data from ACT CF to the EMA. In addition, unless and until we satisfy the conditions of our primary marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment
	of nmDMD, such authorization will continue to be subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA. See "Item&nbsp;1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this trial, we assessed CFTR function by nasal transepithelial difference, or TEPD, and sweat chloride
	concentration as
	tertiary endpoints. TEPD is assessed by means of a standardized, though complex, minimally invasive procedure. In the procedure, a small plastic catheter is used to assess electrical differences
	across the outer cell membrane of nasal mucosa cells in the nostril. Nasal TEPD is physiologically meaningful because nasal mucosa closely reflects CFTR activity in the lung epithelium. Because of the
	role of the CFTR protein in transporting chloride across cell membranes and because of the absence of this protein in cystic fibrosis patients, these patients have an abnormal TEPD chloride
	conductance. Sweat chloride concentration is a commonly used test to diagnose cystic fibrosis and is a measurement of CFTR activity in the sweat gland.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
	number of clinical trials for CFTR restoration therapies have used sweat chloride concentration and nasal TEPD as pharmacodynamic endpoints. However, these two endpoints can exhibit

	TEPD results were positive in our prior Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials discussed below, but sweat chloride testing was not positive in either Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial or in
	our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial. In contrast with our Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials, in which we assessed TEPD at a small number of experienced sites, in the Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, TEPD
	assessments were performed at all centers. This trial was the first time most centers had performed TEPD assessments. In this trial, TEPD results showed high variability and an unexpectedly high

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translarna was generally well tolerated in this clinical trial, and there were generally similar adverse event
	profiles in
	patients treated with Translarna and patients treated with placebo. Most serious adverse events were cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations unrelated to study drug treatment. Most treatment-emergent
	adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Investigators' attributions of severity and drug-relatedness were generally similar across the placebo and Translarna arms. The most common adverse
	events during this trial were cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation (78.2% overall), cough (25.6%) and viral upper respiratory tract infection (21.0%). These events were slightly more frequent in the
	placebo arm and are typical of cystic fibrosis. Adverse events with at least a 10% incidence in any treatment arm that were seen with higher frequency in the Translarna arm were headache (11.9% for
	placebo and 16.7% for Translarna), abdominal pain (12.7% for placebo and 15.0% for Translarna), sinusitis (11.9% for placebo and 12.5% for Translarna) and vomiting (8.5% for placebo and 11.7% for
	Translarna). Eleven patients prematurely discontinued treatment because of adverse events, including eight in the Translarna arm and three in the placebo arm.

	elevations, which can be an indication of impaired kidney function. These adverse events of creatinine elevations were generally mild and transient. In the Translarna treatment arm, clinically
	meaningful creatinine elevations of grade 3 or grade 4 were reported in conjunction with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations. These creatinine elevations were associated with concomitant treatment
	with antibiotics associated with impaired kidney functions, such as aminoglycosides or vancomycin. This led to the subsequent prohibition of concomitant use of Translarna and these potentially

	manner with the goals of obtaining indications of pharmacological activity and to assess dose-response, safety and pharmacokinetics. Each trial had two treatment cycles consisting of a two-week period
	of continuous Translarna treatment (with either 16 mg/kg per day or 40 mg/kg per day), and then a two-week follow-up period without Translarna treatment, with participants evaluated at the beginning
	and end of each two-week period in each cycle. We also conducted an open label, extension trial with a treatment duration of three months for the patients who completed the trial at the site in

	patients with a chloride conductance in the normal range at the end of treatment. These results indicated the presence of pharmacological activity. These improvements were generally followed in the

	Spinal muscular atrophy program
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle wasting and weakness. The disease generally
	manifests early in life. Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by defects in the Survival Motor Neuron 1, or SMN1, gene that encodes the survival motor neuron, or SMN, protein. The SMN protein is critical
	to the health and survival of the nerve cells in the spinal cord responsible for muscle contraction. A second gene, SMN2, is very similar to SMN1, except that SMN2 produces SMN protein that is less
	effective because, unlike SMN1, SMN2 does not include a particular nucleotide sequence known as exon 7. According to the SMA Foundation, spinal muscular atrophy is the leading genetic cause of death
	in infants and toddlers. We estimate that spinal muscular atrophy affects approximately 20,000 to 30,000 children and adults in the United States, Europe and Japan and that one in 11,000 children are
	born with the disease. There is currently no marketed therapy approved to treat the underlying cause of spinal muscular atrophy. Currently available treatments for spinal muscular atrophy are only
	palliative.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using
	our alternative splicing technology and in collaboration with the SMA Foundation, we identified highly potent small molecule splicing modifiers that in non-clinical studies in
	cultured cells isolated from patients with spinal muscular atrophy increased both the inclusion of exon 7 in the SMN2 mRNA and the levels of SMN protein produced by SMN2. Importantly, in studies in
	transgenic mice carrying only the SMN2 gene, these compounds are orally bioavailable, penetrate the blood-brain barrier and increase the levels of full-length SMN2 mRNA and protein in brain, spinal
	cord, muscle and other tissues. In these same mouse studies, treatment with these compounds resulted in increased survival, restoration of body weight, prevention of motor neuron loss and improved
	motor function.

	Cancer stem cell program

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancer stem cells have been identified in numerous tumor types as a subpopulation of tumor cells that have the ability to initiate a
	tumor, produce other cancer cell types, move freely and proliferate throughout the body without attaching to other cells or surfaces and resist chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Many researchers believe
	that the resistance of cancer stem cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a key factor in the failure of current cancer treatments. The BMI1 protein, which is overexpressed in many tumor subtypes,
	is a critical component of the polycomb repressive complex 1, or PRC1. PRC1 modulates expression of genes that are important for cancer stem cell survival, maintenance, stabilization and
	differentiation. PRC1 is an epigenetic enzyme complex, meaning that it is able to modify DNA directly to modulate gene expression without altering the nucleotide sequence in the genetic code. As a
	critical and rate limiting component of PRC1, the BMI1 protein regulates the self-renewal of adult blood and central nervous system stem cells that regulate cell growth.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PTC596
	is a first-in-class, orally bioavailable and potent small molecule that targets tumor stem cell populations by reducing the activity and amount of a protein called BMI1. Elevated
	levels of BMI1 are associated with more aggressive tumors and a poor prognosis in a wide variety of cancers, including glioblastoma. In in vitro assays, PTC596 preferentially depleted cancer stem
	cells derived from glioblastoma, fibrosarcoma, prostate and colon cancers. In contrast, the widely used cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin, temozolomide, methotrexate and indibulin enriched
	the population of cancer stem cells in these same assays.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	animal cancer models using human tumors, 2x/week oral dosing of PTC596 provided tumor control, including reduction of tumor size. PTC596 and the commonly used chemotherapeutic agent,
	paclitaxel, both effectively controlled tumor growth in these animal models. However, PTC596, but not paclitaxel, decreased BMI1 levels, indicating a reduction in cancer stem cells. Consistent with
	this reduction in BMI1 levels, tumors treated with PTC596 had lower levels of cancer stem cells capable of initiating a new tumor than did either untreated tumors or tumors treated with paclitaxel
	when transplanted into a na&iuml;ve mouse. PTC596 is well tolerated at therapeutically effective doses in animals. Preliminary data from animal models suggest that PTC596 may preferentially
	target cancer stem cells without targeting normal stem cells.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use our alternative splicing technology to identify molecules that modulate mRNA splicing. Pre-mRNA splicing is a multi-step
	biochemical reaction. Approximately 94%
	of all human genes undergo splicing. In addition, through alternative splicing, one gene can often generate several mRNA products by including or excluding exons that can result in the mRNA being
	regulated differently or a different protein being produced. Altered regulation of alternative splicing is the direct cause of many human diseases, including many forms of cancer, Riley-Day syndrome
	(familial dysautonomia), myotonic dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	have developed a powerful high-throughput drug discovery technology that enables us to identify small molecule modifiers of pre-mRNA splicing. The technology relies on a sensitive
	quantification of mRNA directly in human cells or tissue samples. Using this technology, we have successfully identified orally bioavailable small molecules that correct splicing of the Survival Motor
	Neuron 2, or SMN2, gene, which is implicated in the genetic disorder spinal muscular atrophy. Based on this experience, we believe that other small molecule drug candidates can be rapidly identified
	that correct alternative splicing of genes, promote inclusion of specific exons into mRNA or force skipping of undesired exons from the mature mRNA. We believe that this technology is potentially
	widely applicable to a large number of target genes in all therapeutic areas.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2011, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Roche and the SMA Foundation to further develop
	and
	commercialize compounds identified under our spinal muscular atrophy sponsored research program with the SMA Foundation and to research other small molecule compounds with potential for therapeutic
	use in patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The research term of this agreement was terminated effective December&nbsp;31, 2014. The ongoing collaboration is governed by a joint steering committee
	consisting of an equal number of representatives of us, the SMA Foundation and Roche. We, the SMA Foundation and Roche have agreed to endeavor to make decisions by consensus, but if the joint steering
	committee cannot reach agreement after following a specified decision resolution procedure, Roche's decision will control. However, Roche may not exercise its final decision-making authority with
	respect to certain specified matters, including any decision that would increase our or the SMA Foundation's obligations, reduce our or the SMA Foundation's rights, expand Roche's rights, or reduce
	Roche's obligations under the license and collaboration agreement.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have granted Roche worldwide exclusive licenses, with the right to grant sublicenses, to our patent rights and

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement, Roche paid us an upfront non-refundable payment
	of
	$30.0&nbsp;million. During the research term, which was terminated effective December&nbsp;31, 2014, Roche provided us with funding, based on an agreed- upon full-time equivalent rate, for an
	agreed-upon number of full- time equivalent employees that we contributed to the research program. We are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $135&nbsp;million in payments if specified
	development and regulatory milestones are achieved and up to an aggregate of $325&nbsp;million in payments if specified sales milestones are achieved. To date, we have earned $27.5&nbsp;million of
	these development and regulatory milestone payments based on the progression of the collaboration from the pre-clinical stage to Phase&nbsp;2 clinical study in SMA patients. We are also entitled to
	tiered single-digit to mid-teen royalties on worldwide net product sales of products developed pursuant to the collaboration. Roche's obligation to pay us royalties will expire generally on a
	country-by- country basis at the latest of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a product in the given country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for that product in such
	country or 10&nbsp;years from the first commercial sale of that product in such country. However, the royalties payable to us may be decreased in certain circumstances. For example, the royalty rate
	in a particular country is reduced if the product is not protected by patents in that country and no longer entitled to regulatory exclusivity in that country. We remain responsible for making any
	payments to the SMA Foundation that may become due under our pre-existing sponsored research agreement with the SMA Foundation.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is
	20&nbsp;years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent's term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which
	compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier
	filed patent. The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval, or PMA, may also be eligible for patent term extension when
	FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the
	patent is in force. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for
	the patent. Patent extension based on Hatch-Waxman cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14&nbsp;years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each
	regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug may be extended.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar
	provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. One means of patent term extension in
	Europe after EMA approval is based obtaining a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). We have applied for SPCs in all applicable European countries in which we have a European patent and expect
	that all will be granted. The maximum patent term extension provided by an SPC is a total of 5&nbsp;years from the date of patent term expiration. In the future, if and when our product candidates
	receive approval by the FDA or other non-European foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of
	the clinical trials for each drug and other factors.

	efficacy and safety, but also for their ease of synthesis and reasonable cost of their starting materials. Translarna is manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes. Our raw
	materials are not scarce and are readily available. We currently rely on a single source for the production of some raw materials and switching to an alternative source could, in some instances, take
	time and could lead to delays in manufacturing. No shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2015, and none are currently expected in 2016. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and

	territories we have engaged with third-party distributors. As a result, orders for Translarna are generally received from hospital and retail pharmacies and, in some cases, one of our third-party
	partner distributors. Our third-party distributors act as intermediaries between us and end-users and do not typically stock significant quantities of Translarna. The ultimate payor for Translarna is

	Market Access Considerations
</U>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translarna
	is currently available on a commercial basis in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Norway, and Slovakia. Commercial drug is also currently
	available in Germany, subject to the matters and timing discussed below. The commercial success of Translarna, and any other product candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and
	maintaining reimbursement from governments and third-party insurers. We have received marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five
	years and older, subject to annual EMA reassessment. However, each country in the EEA has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations and many countries in the EEA have other regulations related to
	the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products in the applicable country. The pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take over 18&nbsp;months from initiation to
	complete. As a result, our commercial launch in the EEA will be on a country-by-country basis and we generally will not be able to commence commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD
	pursuant to our marketing authorization in the EEA in any particular member state of the EEA until we conclude the applicable pricing and reimbursement negotiations and comply with any licensing,
	employment or related regulatory requirements in that country.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
	we have submitted pricing and reimbursement dossiers with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in key EEA countries, we have not received both pricing and reimbursement
	approval in these key countries on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, the price that is approved by local governmental authorities pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes
	may be significantly lower than the price that can be charged for purchases of product in that country pursuant to a reimbursed early access program.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	some instances, reimbursement may be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. For example, we have been engaged in market access discussions with
	National Health Services (NHS) England and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) since 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2014, NHS England determined to reconsider how it assesses
	certain new treatments and postponed certain pricing and reimbursement meetings, including meetings related to Translarna, and in July 2015 determined that final funding decisions on Translarna for
	nmDMD will be made after the conclusion of a specialized appraisal process by NICE. Recently we had constructive discussions with NHS England regarding a managed access agreement, pursuant to which
	Translarna could potentially be made available to qualified nmDMD patients for the period of time established under a final agreement. A managed access agreement is an accordance struck between the
	marketing authorization holder, NICE and NHS England (with the input of patient organizations and clinical experts) allowing for a treatment to be made available to patients for a limited period of
	time, and facilitating further gathering of evidence on a treatments' meaningful benefit. However, our interim discussions with NHS England regarding the managed access agreement remain subject to a
	final positive outcome from the specialized appraisal process by NICE. A decision from NICE is expected in the coming months. In addition, the potential provision of access to Translarna in England is
	subject to actual reimbursement decisions by NHS England.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	some countries, such as France and Germany, EAP and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under discussion with the applicable government
	health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price negotiations, the company may become
	obligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. For example, we have had multiple discussions with the German Federal Association of the Statutory Health Insurances,

	ordering system. Under these circumstances, patients and healthcare professionals in Germany may be able to access Translarna through a reimbursed importation pathway possible under German law. We
	believe this approach will allow us to minimize any access issues for German patients while maintaining a sustainable price. However, we are required to reimburse payors in Germany the difference
	between the commercial price of Translarna in Germany and the unsustainable price established by the German arbitration board for sales made in Germany during the period of December 2015 until such

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical
	trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance
	with protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical
	trial and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. All research subjects or their legally authorized representatives must provide their informed consent in
	writing prior to their participation in a clinical trial. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB and is subject to ongoing IRB monitoring. The IRB must approve the protocol,
	protocol amendments, and the informed consent form. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to be publicly
	posted on the Clinicaltrials.gov website.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical
	trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trials may be conducted in patients or healthy
	volunteers to evaluate the product's safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacokinetics and, if possible, seek to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials usually
	involve controlled trials in a larger but still relatively small number of subjects from the relevant patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible
	short-term adverse effects and safety risks; and provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications.

	human clinical trial of a drug candidate in a smaller patient population and are designed to provide earlier information on drug safety and efficacy. Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trials typically involve
	larger numbers of patients or longer durations of therapy and may involve comparison with placebo, standard treatments or other active comparators.

	at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate
	approval of a clinical trial if the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the research has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA
	typically requires that an NDA include data from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, but approval may be based upon a single adequate and well-controlled clinical trial plus confirmatory
	evidence. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA on the applicant's agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug's safety and effectiveness after NDA
	approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase&nbsp;4 studies.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	FDA's accelerated approval process allows for potentially faster development and approval of certain drugs intended to treat serious or life- threatening illnesses that provide
	meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. Under the accelerated approval process, the adequate and well-controlled clinical trials conducted with the drug establish that the
	drug has an effect on a "surrogate" endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical benefit other than survival or irreversible morbidity.
	Drugs approved through the accelerated approval process are subject to certain post-approval requirements, including that the applicant complete Phase&nbsp;4 clinical trials to demonstrate the
	drug's clinical benefit. If the trials fail to verify the clinical benefit of the drug, the FDA may withdraw approval of the application through a streamlined process.

	some circumstances, appeal the decision using the FDA's dispute resolution procedures. After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things,
	whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and
	purity. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 12&nbsp;months after submission of an NDA in which to complete its initial
	review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of NDAs. The review process and the

	all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of
	data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. As the FDA has not issued
	regulations applying PREA to orphan-designated indications, submission of a pediatric assessment is not presently required for an application to market a product for an orphan-designated indication.

	certain counterpart foreign regulatory agencies in assessing compliance with GCP or GMP. The FDA has entered into international agreements with foreign agencies, including the EMA, in order to

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After FDA approval of a product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements, including, among
	other things, establishment registration and product listing, record-keeping requirements, reporting certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, providing updated safety and efficacy
	information, and complying with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. As a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require the applicant to conduct additional clinical

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	FDA also has the authority to require a drug-specific risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to ensure the safe use of the drug. In determining whether a REMS is
	necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of
	treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or
	patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug's risks, limitations on who may
	prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy at
	18&nbsp;months, three years, and seven years after the strategy's approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on an approved drug if the FDA determines, based on new safety information,
	that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians may prescribe a drug for off-label uses,
	manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion
	of off-label uses. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing advertising and promotion can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, warning and untitled letters from
	the FDA, requests for corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug
	samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Similarly, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, regulates the
	distribution of prescription pharmaceutical drugs, requiring passage of a pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. The DSCSA also
	imposes obligations on drug manufacturers related to suspect product identification/removal, verification, dealing only with authorized trading partners, and other elements. The DSCSA will be
	effective incrementally over a 10-year period, with serialization of prescription drug products distributed in the U.S. effective November&nbsp;27, 2017 for drug manufacturers. The PDMA, DSCSA, and
	state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmCF, nmDMD, nmMPS I, and nonsense mutation
	aniridia. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a "rare disease or condition," which is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in
	the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug
	for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing
	approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant
	funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user-fee benefits. In addition, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the
	indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same
	indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors may receive approval of different
	drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview of application process.
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To obtain regulatory approval of a drug under the European Union's regulatory systems and
	authorization procedures,
	an applicant may submit MAAs under a centralized, decentralized, or national procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products,
	like Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and nmCF, and medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, and optional for certain other innovative products. The centralized
	procedure enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid in all E.U. member states based on a single application. Under the centralized procedure, the EMA's Committee for Human
	Medicinal Products, or CHMP, is required to adopt an opinion on a valid application within 210&nbsp;days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the
	applicant in response to questions. More specifically, on day 120 of the procedure, once the CHMP has received the preliminary assessment reports and opinions from the rapporteur and co- rapporteur,
	it prepares a list of potential outstanding issues, referred to as "other concerns" or "major objections". These are sent to the applicant together with CHMP's recommendation. The CHMP can make one of
	two recommendations: (1)&nbsp;the marketing authorization could be granted provided that satisfactory answers are given to the "other concerns" and/or "major objections" identified and that all
	conditions outlined in the list of outstanding issues are implemented and complied with; or (2)&nbsp;the product is not approvable since there are "major objections".
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants
	have three months from the date of receiving the potential outstanding issues to respond to the CHMP, and can request a three-month extension if necessary. The granting of a
	marketing authorization will depend on the recommendations and potential major objections identified by the CHMP as well as the ability of the applicant to adequately respond to these findings. An
	accelerated assessment can be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic
	innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150&nbsp;days. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the MAA must be adopted by the
	European Commission, after consulting the European Union member states, which in total can take more than 60&nbsp;days.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
	applicant for an MAA may request a re-examination in the event of a negative opinion, in connection with which CHMP appoints new rapporteurs. Within 60&nbsp;days of receipt of the
	negative opinion, the applicant must submit a document explaining the basis for its request for re-examination. The CHMP has 60&nbsp;days to consider the applicant's request for re-examination. The
	applicant may
	request an oral explanation before the CHMP, which is routinely granted, following which CHMP will adopt a final opinion. The final opinion, whether positive or negative, is published by the CHMP
	shortly following the CHMP meeting at which the oral explanation takes place.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional marketing authorizations.
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In specific circumstances, as with Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, E.U. legislation enables
	applicants
	to obtain a marketing authorization on a conditional basis prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals
	may be granted for products designated as orphan medicinal products, if (1)&nbsp;the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2)&nbsp;it is likely that the applicant will be in a position
	to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3)&nbsp;the product fulfills unmet medical needs, and (4)&nbsp;the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market
	of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be
	fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data.
	Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified
	conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing
	authorization. The granting of a conditional marketing authorization will depend on the applicant's ability to fulfill the conditions imposed within the agreed upon deadline.

</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the granting of a conditional marketing authorization, the marketing
	authorization holder
	may submit an application to vary the conditional marketing authorization under a variation procedure. For example, during the third quarter of 2015, we filed a variation to our marketing
	authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD to seek inclusion of Translarna for nmCF. In the case of the introduction of an additional therapeutic indication, the timeframe for the
	variation procedure for the initial assessment of the dossier is generally 90&nbsp;days (plus up to 20&nbsp;days for validation).
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
	in the framework of a variation application assessment procedure, the EMA may send one or more requests for supplementary information to the marketing authorization holder,
	requiring that additional information be provided by the marketing authorization holder to support its variation application. Such supplementary requests will be sent together with a timetable stating
	the date by when the marketing authorization holder must submit the requested data and, where appropriate, the extended evaluation period to be applied to such variation procedure. The 90&nbsp;day
	variation procedure may be suspended for up to three months for the marketing authorization holder to submit its responses to such supplementary requests. The marketing authorization holder will be
	notified of the outcome of the CHMP's assessment of the variation procedure within 15&nbsp;days from the adoption of the CHMP opinion. If unfavorable, the CHMP opinion may be subject to a
	re-examination procedure upon the marketing authorization holder's request. This may imply an additional minimum two month procedure. If the CHMP opinion is favorable, the European Commission will
	vary the marketing authorization to introduce the additional therapeutic indication within approximately two months from the receipt of the final CHMP opinion.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the European Union, independently generated data submitted as part of a full marketing authorization application dossier are protected by regulatory data protection ('data
	exclusivity') for a period of eight years from the granting of a marketing authorization for a 'reference product'. This means that for a period of eight years, competent authorities may not accept
	marketing authorization applications that rely on the independently generated data in the marketing authorization dossier of the reference product. Generic medicinal products that rely on the
	independently generated data of the reference product may not be placed on the market for 10&nbsp;years from the granting of the initial marketing authorization for the reference medicinal product.
	These periods of data exclusivity and market exclusivity do not prevent other companies from obtaining a marketing authorization based on their own independently generated data.

	connection with the marketing authorization granted for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD by the EMA, we are required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the
	manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products that are in addition to the other conditions of the marketing authorization described above. We must, for example, comply with the
	E.U.'s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post- authorization studies and
	additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. Other requirements relate to, for example, the manufacturing of products and active pharmaceutical ingredients in accordance with good manufacturing
	practice standards. Competent authorities of E.U. member states may conduct inspections to verify our compliance with applicable requirements, and we will have to continue to expend time, money and
	effort to remain compliant. Non-compliance with E.U. requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric
	population, can also result in significant financial penalties in the E.U. Similarly, failure to comply with the E.U.'s requirements regarding the protection of individual personal data can also lead
	to significant penalties and sanctions. Individual E.U. member states may also impose various sanctions and penalties in case we do not comply with locally applicable requirements.

	administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict our promotional activities with health care professionals. In addition, legislation adopted at the European
	Union level and by individual European Union member states require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product's Summary of Product

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many jurisdictions allow the supply of unauthorized medicinal products in the context of strictly regulated and exceptional early
	access programs, and some countries may provide reimbursement for drugs provided in the context of such programs. In the European Union, the legal basis for early access programs, also referred to as
	named-patient and compassionate use programs, is set out in the E.U. legislation regulating the authorization, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medicinal products. Detailed regulatory
	requirements applicable to early access programs have been adopted and implemented by E.U. member states in their national laws. The promotion, advertising and marketing of unauthorized medicinal
	products is generally prohibited, and authorization for early access programs must generally be obtained from national competent authorities, which might not grant such authorization. Obtaining
	authorization for an early access program in one country does not ensure that authorization will be obtained in another country. U.S. law permits "expanded access" (also known as compassionate use and
	treatment use) for certain patients with serious diseases who have no comparable alternative treatment options. To provide expanded access, sponsors must submit detailed regulatory information to the
	FDA. FDA authorization depends on several different factors, including whether expanded access will interfere with related clinical trials or drug development. Sponsors may not promote products as
	safe or effective for expanded-access uses.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceuticals
	have been a focus of this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of
	government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the
	Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical
	products. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this law may decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we may receive for any approved products. Likewise, healthcare reform

	together as the Affordable Care Act, contain provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products by increasing the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name
	drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%, effective 2011, extending the Medicaid rebate to Medicaid managed care plans, changing the Medicaid rebate rates for line extensions or new formulations of oral solid dosage
	form, mandating discounts for certain Medicare Part&nbsp;D beneficiaries, and imposing a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell "branded prescription drugs,"
	effective 2011, expanding the types of entities eligible for the "Section&nbsp;340B discounts" for outpatient drugs, requiring manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under
	which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the
	manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part&nbsp;D and creating a process for approval of biologic therapies that are similar or identical to approved biologics. There are
	numerous steps required to implement the Affordable Care Act, and implementation remains ongoing. Congress also has enacted, and may continue to seek, legislative changes that alter, delay, or
	eliminate some of its provisions. On February&nbsp;1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a long-awaited new rule, the Medicaid Program Covered Outpatient Drug Final Rule,
	effective April&nbsp;1, 2016, implementing various provisions of the Affordable Care Act related to "covered outpatient drugs," including revising the calculation of "average manufacturer price" and
	addressing other issues relating to Medicaid price reporting and reimbursement. These and other changes contribute to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the Affordable Care
	Act; they also underscore the potential for additional reform going forward. Certain provisions of enacted or proposed legislative changes may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of
	healthcare items and services.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
	is increasing pricing pressure from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs, particularly for new and innovative therapies, that could negatively affect the
	company's sales and profit margins. In the United States, these include practices of managed care groups, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers. Changes to the
	health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector
	beneficiaries, could negatively impact the company's sales and profit margins. Such pressures may also increase the risk of litigation or investigations by the government regarding pricing
	calculations. There has also been recent negative publicity and Congressional scrutiny around pharmaceutical drug pricing in the U.S. These dynamics may give rise to negative reactions to pricing
	decisions for products for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future, possibly limiting our ability to generate revenue and attain profitability. Moreover, the pharmaceutical industry
	will likely face greater regulation and political and legal action in the future. In this healthcare regulatory climate, there may be significant delays in and impediments to obtaining coverage and
	reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Any regulatory approval of our products is limited to specific diseases and indications for which our products have been deemed safe and effective by the FDA.
	Coverage by federal healthcare programs may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities' coverage of the same products. In
	the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of the
	products will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other organizations. Obtaining
	reimbursement for orphan drugs may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices typically associated with drugs directed at smaller populations of patients. In addition, third-party payors
	are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement in the use of a higher
	priced drug. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently
	restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.

	governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. In some countries, governments can set conditions that must be satisfied for
	prices to be set at a certain value. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after
	reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high- priced member states), can further reduce
	prices. In some countries we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain

	Fraud and Abuse Laws

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any present or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and professionals and customers may expose us to
	broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may restrict certain marketing and contracting practices. These laws include, and are not limited to, anti-kickback
	and false claims statutes.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both
	the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or Bribery Act are broad in scope and will require companies to make and keep books and records
	that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA prohibits the offering, promising, giving, or
	authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure any other improper
	advantage, or obtain or retain business. Under the UK Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the
	United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, by employees and persons associated with the company
	in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company.
</FONT>

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind,
	to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, or order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare
	programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others. Although a
	number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors exist to protect certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors for this statute are narrow, and practices that
	involve compensation intended to induce prescriptions, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not always
	meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection. Further, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. This
	amendment provides that a person or entity no longer needs to have knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items
	or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Several other countries, including the
	United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations.
</FONT>

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be
	presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
	Several pharmaceutical and health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal
	programs for the free product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of these companies' marketing of a product for unapproved, and thus non
	reimbursable, uses. Potential liability under the federal False Claims Act includes mandatory treble damages and significant per claim penalties, currently set at $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim.
	The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state
	programs; furthermore, in several states, these statutes and regulations apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of
	a manufacturer's product from reimbursement under government programs, debarment, criminal fines, and imprisonment.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Affordable Care Act included a provision requiring certain providers and suppliers of items and services to Federal Health Care Programs to report and return overpayments within
	sixty days after
	they are "identified" (the "Overpayment Statute"). In February 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") released long-awaited regulatory guidance (in the form of a final rule) to
	Medicare Part&nbsp;A and Part&nbsp;B providers and suppliers regarding how to comply with the Overpayment Statute. CMS had previously released a final rule addressing overpayments involving
	Medicare Part&nbsp;C and Part&nbsp;D providers in May 2014. Although Medicare Part&nbsp;A/B/C/D providers and suppliers have faced federal False Claims Act liability since 2010 for failures to
	comply with the Overpayment Statute, these final rules interpreting the Overpayment Statute provide guidance to providers and suppliers regarding how to comply appropriately with applicable
	obligations, and guidance to government regulators and enforcement authorities regarding monitoring and prosecuting suspected violations. This final rule is not directly applicable to manufacturers,
	but may impact their customers and potential customers who are Medicare providers and suppliers.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical
	supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, as
	well as physician ownership and investment interests. Payments made to physicians and certain research institutions for clinical trials are included within the ambit of this law. Pharmaceutical
	manufacturers are required to report and disclose payments and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year.
	Manufacturers were required to make these first reports for information collected in 2013 by March&nbsp;31, 2014. Such information is publicly available from the Secretary of Health and Human
	Services in a searchable format, with data collected in each calendar year published the following June. . Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to
	$150,000 per year (and up to $1.0&nbsp;million per year for "knowing failures") for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. If not
	preempted by this federal law, several states currently require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and
	payments to individual physicians in those states. Depending on the state, legislation may prohibit various other marketing related activities, or require the posting of information relating to
	clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states, such as California, Nevada, Connecticut and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or
	marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals. Manufacturers that fail to comply with these state laws can face civil penalties.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory
	requirements to disclose publicly payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations have also been enacted in certain European Union member states. In
	addition, self-regulatory bodies of the pharmaceuticals industry, such as the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ("EFPIA"), have published codes of conduct to which its
	members have agreed to abide to, that require the public disclosure of payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of
	$593.0&nbsp;million. We have historically financed our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock in public offerings, the private placements of our preferred stock,
	collaborations, bank debt, convertible debt financings, and grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas
	addressed by our product and product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. The net losses we incur may fluctuate
	significantly from quarter to quarter.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	are a growing commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, but prior to 2014 we devoted substantially all of our efforts on research and development, including clinical trials. In
	August 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Translarna&#153; (ataluren) for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy caused by nonsense mutations, or nmDMD, in
	ambulatory patients aged five years and older. The marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the European Medicines Agency,
	or EMA, of the risk benefit balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment, and was further conditioned on our submission of the final report, including additional
	efficacy and safety data, from ACT DMD, which we submitted in January 2016. See "Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates" for further
	detail regarding the annual EMA reassessment process, including a description of the risk benefit balance.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	announced the initial results of ACT DMD in October 2015. While the primary efficacy endpoint in the intent to treat population, or ITT, did not achieve statistical significance, we
	believe that the totality of clinical data from ACT DMD and our prior Phase&nbsp;2b trial support the clinical benefit of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In February 2016, we received a
	Refuse to File letter from the FDA regarding our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, which was primarily based on our analysis of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data
	from our trials. There is substantial risk that the FDA will continue to not agree and that the EMA and other regulators may
	not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials. An inability to maintain current or obtain new marketing authorizations for Translarna
	for nmDMD, including in Europe, the United States, or in other territories, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of
	nmDMD. See "Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates" for further detail regarding how the ACT DMD results could impact
	our ability to commercialize Translarna.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	marketing authorization described above allows us to market Translarna in the 31 member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA. We commenced our commercial launch of Translarna
	in Germany in December 2014 and we expect to commercially launch in other key countries in the EEA through the fourth quarter of 2015 and in future years, subject to completion of pricing and
	reimbursement negotiations. We anticipate that our expenses will increase in connection with the expansion of our global infrastructure as we continue to establish an international presence and
	commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, and distribution and manufacturing expenses.

	and the EMA, in connection with our marketing authorization in the EEA, which is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the risk benefit

	February&nbsp;22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA stating that, in the view of the FDA, both the Phase&nbsp;2b and Phase&nbsp;3 ACT DMD trials were
	negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled
	patients. In addition, the FDA noted that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. Until we are able to meet with the FDA to obtain further clarity on
	the matters set forth in its letter, we are unable to fully assess our potential path forward for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States, including whether we will submit a new or
	revised NDA and the agency's willingness to review, and the outcome of, any such submission. As a result, we are unable to estimate the timing or potential for a launch of Translarna for the treatment
	of nmDMD in the United States. There is substantial risk that, notwithstanding any further dialogue we may be able to initiate with the agency, the FDA will continue to disagree with our
	interpretation of our trial results and we may be required
	to perform additional clinical and non-clinical trials at significant cost, which, if successful may enable FDA review of an NDA submission. Any such requirement for additional trials would most
	likely result in our inability to sell Translarna in the United States for a significant period of time, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the sales of

	Translarna
	is small. The marketing label approved by the European Commission further limits the currently treatable patient population to ambulatory nmDMD patients aged five years and older who have
	been identified through genetic testing. Overall, we estimate that the potential opportunity for a treatment for nonsense mutation DMD is approximately 7,000 patients worldwide including approximately
	2,000 patients in the United States and approximately 5,000 patients outside of the United States, including the European Union, Latin America, Japan and Australia. We estimate that approximately 40%
	of nmDMD patients are ambulatory and at least five years old. Our estimates of both the number of people who have DMD caused by a nonsense mutation, as well as the subset of people with nmDMD who are
	ambulatory and at least five years old, are based on our beliefs and estimates derived from a variety of sources and may prove to be incorrect. Information concerning the eligible patient population
	is generally limited to certain geographies and may not employ definitive measures capable of establishing with precision the actual number of nmDMD patients in such
	geography. If the market opportunities for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD are smaller than we believe they are, our business and anticipated revenues will be negatively impacted. Although we
	intend to seek to expand the approved product label of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the future, the timing of, and our ability to generate, the necessary data or results required to obtain
	expanded regulatory approval is currently uncertain. Given the small number of patients who have nmDMD, and the smaller number of patients who meet the criteria for treatment under our current
	marketing authorization, our commercial opportunity is limited. It is critical to the commercial success of Translarna for nmDMD that we successfully identify and treat these patients.

	2016, and our ability to implement measures, including pharmacovigilance plans, that are detailed in the risk management plan. We received EC approval of the annual renewal in August 2015. We plan to
	seek to renew the marketing authorization on an annual basis until we have satisfied the conditions of the marketing authorization and a full marketing authorization is granted. If we fail to satisfy
	such requirements, or if it is determined that the balance of risks and benefits of using Translarna changes materially, the European Commission could, at the EMA's recommendation, vary, suspend,
	withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require additional clinical trials, any of which would negatively impact our anticipated revenue from Translarna and
	materially harm our business. See "Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates" for further detail regarding the annual EMA reassessment

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population did not achieve statistical significance in the Phase&nbsp;2b (completed in 2009) or Phase&nbsp;3 ACT DMD (completed in 2015)
	clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Although we believe that the collective data from these trials provide strong support for concluding that Translarna was active and showed
	clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in these trials, on February&nbsp;22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA regarding our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of
	nmDMD. The FDA stated in the Refuse to File letter that our NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Specifically, we were notified in the letter that, in the view of the FDA,
	both the Phase&nbsp;2b and Phase&nbsp;3 ACT DMD trials were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc
	adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. In addition, the FDA noted that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of
	Translarna.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
	is substantial risk that, notwithstanding any further dialogue we may be able to initiate with the agency, the FDA will continue to disagree with our interpretation of our trial
	results and we may be required to perform additional clinical and non-clinical trials at significant cost, which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission, which would have a material
	adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations. Any such requirement for additional trials would also most likely result in our inability to sell Translarna in the
	United States for a significant period of time. In addition, there is substantial risk that regulators in other territories, including the EMA, will not agree with our interpretation of the results of
	ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials, and may require us to conduct additional clinical trials at significant cost.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
	the marketing authorization granted by the European Commission for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients age five years and older is subject to an annual
	reassessment by the EMA and was further conditioned, among other things, on our submission of the final report from ACT DMD, which we submitted in January 2016. If the EMA does not view the results of
	ACT DMD as favorable, if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the marketing authorization, or if the EMA's assessment of the balance of risks and benefits of using Translarna changes materially
	(whether because the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population did not achieve statistical significance in the clinical trials described above or for other reasons), the European Commission
	could, at the EMA's recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require additional clinical trials. See "Risk Factors&#151;Risks
	Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates" for further detail regarding the annual EMA reassessment process, including a description of the risk benefit balance. We also
	sell Translarna under reimbursed early access programs in a limited number of countries and there is no assurance that such sales will continue to be permitted in any particular country. If any of
	these events were to occur, they would negatively impact our anticipated revenue from Translarna and would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population did not achieve statistical significance in our prior Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of
	nmCF (completed in 2011) and did not achieve the primary objective in one of four prior Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials that we conducted for Translarna for the treatment of nmCF in which we measured
	change in chloride conductance in nasal cells over the course of treatment. We may similarly fail to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in ACT CF, our confirmatory Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial of
	Translarna. If the results of ACT CF are not favorable, or fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other regulators, we may need to conduct additional
	clinical trials at significant cost or altogether abandon development of Translarna for nmCF.

	Our conclusions regarding the activity and potential efficacy of Translarna in nmDMD are primarily

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meta-analysis results, which favored Translarna in the 6MWT and each secondary end point timed function test, are considered statistically significant.
	Typically, a trial result is statistically significant if the chance of it occurring when the treatment is like placebo is less than one in 20, resulting in a p-value of less than 0.05. The p-values
	for the 6MWT and each secondary end point timed function test in the pre-specified subgroup of ACT DMD patients with a baseline 300-400 meter 6MWD also had p-values of less than 0.05, but due to the
	sequential testing method, these p-values are considered nominal. Nominal p-values cannot be compared to the typical significance level (p-value less than 0.05) to determine statistical significance
	without being adjusted for the testing of multiple dose groups, end points or analyses of subgroups. A p-value is called nominal if it is the result of one particular comparison prior to any
	pre-specified multiplicity adjustment, such as when two active treatments are compared to placebo or when two or more subgroups are analyzed.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, after determining that the primary efficacy endpoint did not achieve statistical significance in our completed Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment
	of nmDMD and in our completed Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial of Translarna for nmCF, we performed retrospective and subgroup analyses that we believe provide strong support for concluding that
	Translarna was active and showed clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in these trials. Although we believe that these additional analyses of the results of these trials were warranted, a
	retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results can result in the introduction of bias if the analysis is inappropriately tailored or
	influenced by knowledge of the data and actual results. Some of our favorable statistical data from these trials also are based on nominal p-values that reflect only one particular comparison when

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because

	we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. Our reliance on nominal p-values for some of our statistical data and our use of
	retrospective analyses had a negative impact on the FDA's view of our interpretation of the results of our Phase&nbsp;2b trial, ACT DMD and the totality of data from our clinical trials. We need

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our

	variation to our marketing authorization for Translarna to include Translarna for nmCF on a conditional basis, could negatively impact the evaluation by the EMA of our applications for full marketing
	authorization for Translarna for nmDMD as well as the annual EMA reassessment process of our current marketing authorization, and, even if we successfully complete ACT CF, could negatively impact the
	evaluation by the EMA or the FDA of our anticipated applications for full marketing authorization for Translarna for nmCF. If any of these events were to occur, they would negatively impact our

	potential of Translarna. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. There is substantial risk that,
	notwithstanding any further dialogue we may be able to initiate with the agency, the FDA will continue to disagree with our interpretation of our trial results and we may be required to perform
	additional clinical and non-clinical trials at significant cost, which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
	performance and results of operations. In addition, there is substantial risk that in addition to the FDA, other regulators, including the EMA, will not agree with our interpretation of the results of
	ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials in Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
	it is possible that, once completed and even if successful, the EMA or the FDA may not consider the results of ACT CF to be sufficient for approval of Translarna for such
	indication. The FDA typically requires two adequate and well-controlled pivotal clinical trials to support marketing authorization of a product candidate for a particular indication. The EMA or the
	FDA could determine that the results of our trials are not sufficiently robust, are subject to confounding factors or are not adequately supported by other trial endpoints. In addition, although we
	have had discussions with the FDA regarding ACT CF, the FDA may not consider our proposed trial design acceptable. For example, in 2012, the FDA indicated that in its view the data from our completed
	Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial and other data from our development program in cystic fibrosis do not by themselves support an NDA submission and, consequently, the FDA informed us that additional
	clinical data would be required to establish the evidence necessary to support eventual filing of an NDA for the use of Translarna to treat nmCF.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	had additional interactions with the FDA in 2013 regarding the clinical development design which would have the potential to support an NDA, but we did not achieve a consensus between
	the EMA and FDA views. While we have incorporated feedback from the FDA into our ACT CF trial design, we believe that certain key recommendations from the FDA are not appropriate. Two of the key
	recommendations that we are in disagreement with are the designation of FEV
<SUB>
	1
</SUB>
	, CF pulmonary exacerbations, and body mass index as three co-primary endpoints for the trial and a suggested
	three-year trial duration. FEV
<SUB>
	1
</SUB>
	is the primary endpoint in ACT CF, with CF pulmonary exacerbations and body mass index as secondary endpoints, which is consistent with other clinical
	trials currently ongoing in cystic fibrosis and our earlier discussions with the FDA. Additionally, we believe that extending the study duration to three years would result in a number of
	complications that would ultimately limit the robustness of the data and conclusions that could be drawn from the results. Based on these interactions, we nonetheless initiated ACT CF in the first
	half of 2014 consistent with feedback from the EMA on our trial design. If the FDA does not consider our trial designs acceptable, we may need to conduct more than one confirmatory clinical trial and
	our ability to receive marketing authorization for this indication could be delayed or prevented.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
	to the Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD, there was no precedent of an established trial design to evaluate the efficacy of Translarna in nmDMD over a
	48&nbsp;week duration. In addition, clinical understanding of the methodologies used to analyze the resulting data were also limited. The study design and enrollment criteria for ACT DMD were based
	on available natural history data of the disease, including third party data and results from our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial. An evolving understanding in the DMD community has led to a greater
	appreciation of the optimal window for the 6MWT in assessing physical function. We believe that this factor may have led to the primary efficacy endpoint in the intent to treat population not
	achieving statistical significance in ACT DMD.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
	regard to nmCF, we believe that we now understand subgroup effects that we observed in our completed Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial and that we have designed our confirmatory
	Phase&nbsp;3 ACT CF clinical trial of Translarna to take these effects into account. However, we may nonetheless experience unknown complications with ACT CF. As a result, we may not achieve the
	pre-specified endpoint with statistical significance in ACT CF, which would make approval of Translarna for this indication significantly more difficult to obtain.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	are faced with similar challenges in connection with the design of our Phase&nbsp;2 proof-of-concept studies of Translarna in nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia, and nonsense
	mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 because there is also limited historical clinical trial experience for the development of drugs to treat the underlying cause of these disorders.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
	example, with respect to nmMPS I, while clinical trials of enzyme replacement therapies conducted by third party sponsors have provided some insight into the disorder, enzyme
	replacement therapies do not sufficiently address the central nervous system, skeletal or cardiac symptoms associated with the
	disorder. In addition, our own pre-clinical and early stage clinical trials targeting nmMPS I&nbsp;have been limited in duration and, as a result, it is substantially uncertain whether our clinical
	design will optimize the duration or level of dosing or that we will be able to demonstrate a statistically significant biochemical or clinical effect in the primary or secondary pre-specified
	endpoints selected for the study.

	led to discontinuation. As compared to the placebo group, the Translarna treatment arm also had a higher incidence of adverse events of creatinine elevations, which can be an indication of impaired
	kidney function. In the Translarna treatment arm, more severe clinically meaningful creatinine elevations were reported in conjunction with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations. These creatinine
	elevations were associated with concomitant treatment with antibiotics associated with impaired kidney functions, such as aminoglycosides or vancomycin. This led to the subsequent prohibition of
	concomitant use of Translarna and these antibiotics, which was successful in addressing this issue in the clinical trial. If patients in the Translarna arm of a confirmatory Phase&nbsp;3 clinical

	activities or comply with such laws and regulations, our ability to commercialize Translarna in those jurisdictions in which it is or may be approved will be adversely affected. If we are unable to
	establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue consistent with our
	expectations and may not become profitable.

	commercial
	launch of Translarna or any other product candidate for which we recruit a commercial team and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	regulations and practices that govern marketing authorizations, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future
	legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries, including almost all of the member
	states of the European Economic Area, require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing
	approval is granted. In some foreign markets, including the European market, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is
	granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing authorization for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly
	for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the
	product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing authorization.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	ability to commercialize Translarna or any other product candidate successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related
	treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private
	health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the EU and U.S. healthcare industries and
	elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications.
	Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our products can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. Increasingly, third-party payors are
	requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for

	level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing authorization. Obtaining reimbursement for Translarna may be
	particularly difficult because of the higher prices typically associated with drugs directed at smaller populations of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict
	requirements for reimbursement of a higher priced drug. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
	may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the applicable
	regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development,
	manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary
	according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for
	other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently
	restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment
	limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. In addition, there has been recent negative publicity and Congressional scrutiny around pharmaceutical drug pricing in the U.S. Moreover, U.S.
	government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate drug prices and reimbursement, particularly for new and innovative therapies. These dynamics may give
	rise to negative reactions to pricing decisions for products for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future, possibly
	limiting our ability to generate revenue and attain profitability. In the European Union, reference pricing systems and other measures may lead to cost containment and reduced prices. Our inability to
	promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating
	results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. In addition, in the European Union, for medicines authorized by the centralized
	authorization procedure, an authorized trader, such as a wholesaler, can purchase a medicine in one EU member state and import the product into another EU member state. This process is called
	"parallel distribution". As a result, a purchaser in one EU member state may seek to import Translarna from another EU member state where Translarna is sold at a lower price. This could have a
	negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth.

	of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our clinical trial site relating to our then pending MAA for approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following these inspections, we received
	inspection reports containing a combination of critical and major findings. These findings related to waivers we granted to admit patients to our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of Translarna for the
	treatment of nmDMD in advance of formal approval of protocol amendments that would have established their eligibility for the trial, as well as our oversight of our trial sites and the completeness or

	assurance department we have established, since the conclusion of our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In addition, we proposed corrective action plans to
	address the inspectors' specific findings. If we do not meet our commitment to the corrective actions we proposed to the EMA, we may face additional consequences, including rejection of data or other
	direct action by national regulatory authorities, which could require us to conduct additional clinical trials or other supportive studies to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for

	selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, such as our collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation, for our spinal muscular atrophy program. We
	have entered into arrangements with certain third parties to market or distribute Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in certain countries and, as we continue to implement our commercialization
	plans for Translarna, we anticipate that we will engage additional third parties to perform these functions for us in other countries. We generally plan to seek collaborators for the development and
	commercialization of product candidates that have high anticipated development costs, are directed at indications for which a potential collaborator has a particular expertise, or involve markets that
	require a large sales and marketing organization to serve effectively. Our likely collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements may

	desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too
	late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, if we license technology or product candidates from third parties in the future, these license agreements may not permit us to control the preparation,
	filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering this intellectual property. These agreements could also give our licensors the right to enforce the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of
	much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in
	patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either
	the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, patent law in many countries restricts the patentability of
	methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are
	met, currently, the first to file&nbsp;a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March&nbsp;16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to
	the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not
	published until 18&nbsp;months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending
	patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (the "Act"), which reformed certain patent
	laws in the U.S., may create additional uncertainty. The significant changes engendered by the Act include switching from a "first-to-invent" system to a "first-to-file" system, and the implementation
	of new procedures that permit competitors to challenge our patents in the USPTO after grant, including inter partes review and post grant review.

	allocate significant resources to preventing such circumvention. Legal and regulatory developments in the European Union and elsewhere may also result in clinical trial data submitted as part of an
	MAA becoming publicly available. The EMA Policy on publication of clinical data, as well as the current application of European Union freedom of information regulations, could impact our proprietary
	information (comprising both clinical and non-clinical data) that would normally be maintained by a regulatory body as confidential. Such developments could enable other companies to circumvent our
	intellectual property rights and use our clinical trial data to obtain marketing authorizations in the European Union and in other jurisdictions. Such developments may also require us to allocate
	significant resources or engage in litigation to prevent other companies from circumventing or violating our intellectual property rights. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing our

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized
	use, we may be required to file claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us
	alleging that we infringe their intellectual property or defenses, such that they do not infringe our intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a
	patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent's claims narrowly or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our
	patents do not cover the technology in question.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our
	product and our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual
	property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property
	rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference, derivation, inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The risks of
	being involved in such litigation and proceedings may also increase as our product candidates approach commercialization, and as we gain greater visibility as a public company. Third parties may
	assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product and our
	product candidates. Since patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18&nbsp;months after filing, or in some cases not at all, with new
	publications occurring continuously, there may be patents or patent applications relating to our product or our product candidates that we are unaware of. There may also be pending or future patent
	applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing Translarna. Thus, we do not know with certainty whether Translarna, or any of our other product candidates, or our commercialization
	thereof, would or would not infringe any third party's intellectual property.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
	we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, or in order to avoid or settle litigation, we could be required to obtain a license to continue developing and
	marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be
	non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us, and could require us to make substantial payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease
	commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees if we are found to have willfully
	infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product or our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business
	operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our
	business.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
	example, it is possible that one or more third parties might bring a patent infringement or other legal proceeding against us regarding Translarna. We are aware of an issued U.S.
	patent and international patent applications that purport to disclose or contain claims to chemical scaffolds that are sufficiently broad that they could be read to encompass ataluren, the active
	ingredient in Translarna, even though neither the issued U.S. patent nor any of the international patents or patent applications specifically discloses ataluren. In order to successfully challenge the
	validity of any issued U.S. patent that may allegedly include ataluren within the scope of a granted claim, we would need to overcome that patent's presumption of validity in district court or prove
	unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence before the USPTO. There is no assurance that a court or the USPTO would find these claims to be invalid or unpatentable, respectively. In addition,
	we believe that the public notice given by our testing of ataluren in clinical trials for the purpose of seeking FDA approval would be a valid defense against any infringement claims in the United
	States based on the availability of any statutory research exemptions. However, there can be no assurance that our interpretation of the exemption would be upheld, were the exemption interpreted as
	covering only our preclinical research activities, and not the commercialization of ataluren.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect our rights in any trademark we intend to use for our product or our product candidates, including Translarna, we may seek to

	our product or product candidates. Failure to obtain trademark registrations may place our use of the trademarks at risk or make them subject to legal challenges, which could force us to choose
	alternative names for our product or product candidates. In addition, the FDA, and other regulatory authorities outside the United States, typically conduct an independent review of proposed product
	names for pharmaceuticals, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names for medications, which could result in prescribing errors. These regulatory authorities may
	also object to a proposed product name if they believe the name inappropriately makes or implies a therapeutic claim. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities outside the United States object to any
	of our proposed product names, we may be required
	to adopt alternative names for our product or product candidates. If we adopt alternative names, either because of our inability to obtain a trademark registration or because of objections from

	an effort to adopt a new product name that would be registrable under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA and other regulatory
	authorities, which could cause delays in getting our products to market and substantially increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	announced the initial results of ACT DMD, our confirmatory Phase&nbsp;3 trial in nmDMD, in October 2015. While the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population did not achieve
	statistical significance in ACT DMD, we believe that the totality of clinical data from ACT DMD and our prior Phase&nbsp;2b trial support the clinical benefit of Translarna for the treatment of
	nmDMD. However, on February&nbsp;22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA regarding our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of
	nmDMD. The FDA stated in the Refuse to File letter that our NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Specifically, we were notified in the letter that, in the view of the FDA,
	both the Phase&nbsp;2b and Phase&nbsp;3 ACT DMD trials were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc
	adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. In addition, the FDA noted that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of
	Translarna. See "Item&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Business&#151;Marketing authorization matters for Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy&#151;United States" for additional

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
	is substantial risk that, notwithstanding any further dialogue we may be able to initiate with the agency, the FDA will continue to disagree with our interpretation of our trial
	results and we may be required to perform additional clinical and non-clinical trials at significant cost, which, if successful, may enable FDA review of an NDA submission, which would have a material
	adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations. Any such requirement for additional trials would also most likely result in our inability to sell Translarna in the
	United States for a significant period of time. In addition, there is substantial risk that regulators in other territories, including the EMA, will not agree with our interpretation of the results of
	ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data from our trials, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. See

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	received marketing authorization to market Translarna for nmDMD in the EEA in the third quarter of 2014. This marketing authorization is subject to annual EMA reassessment and was
	further conditioned on our submission of the final report, including additional efficacy and safety data, from ACT DMD, which we submitted in January 2016. In 2015, we received marketing
	authorizations for Translarna in South Korea and Israel; each of which are largely contingent upon continued marketing authorization in the EEA. We have not otherwise received marketing authorization
	for Translarna or any of our other product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have begun seeking and intend to continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for
	the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the EEA. We may not receive necessary approvals from the FDA, the EMA, or other regulators to further commercialize Translarna for nmDMD or to

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, during the third quarter of 2015 we submitted a variation to our marketing authorization application with the EMA to seek to include Translarna for

	third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing marketing authorization requires the timely preparation and submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and
	supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate's safety and efficacy. In response to changes in the regulatory environment or
	requests from regulators, we may elect, or be obliged, to postpone a regulatory submission to include additional analyses, including those intended to strengthen our submission or facilitate regulator
	review, which could cause delays in getting our products to market and substantially increase our costs. Securing marketing authorization also requires the submission of information about the product
	manufacturing process to, and inspection of
	manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that Translarna or any of our other product candidates are not effective or only moderately effective, or
	have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing authorization or that prevent or limit commercial use.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	process of obtaining marketing authorizations is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including
	the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing authorization policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or
	regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion
	in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition,
	varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing authorization of a product candidate. Any marketing authorization we
	ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United States, may designate drugs for relatively
	small patient populations as orphan drugs. We have obtained orphan drug designations from the EMA and from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, nmCF, nmMPS I, and nonsense mutation
	aniridia. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing authorization for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled
	to a period of market exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the EMA from accepting another marketing application for a similar medicinal product or the FDA from approving
	another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable market exclusivity period is ten years in the European Union and seven years in the United
	States. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, including if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market
	exclusivity is no longer justified. However, in the European Union, generic medicinal products that rely on the independently generated data submitted as part of a full marketing authorization
	application dossier of an authorized medicinal product, a "reference product", may not be placed on the market for 10&nbsp;years from the granting of the initial marketing authorization for the
	reference product.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the European Union, a "similar medicinal product" is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal
	product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. For a drug such as Translarna, which is composed of small molecules, the FDA defines "same drug" as a drug that contains the same
	active moiety and is intended for the same use. Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity for Translarna for these indications, both in the European Union and in the United States, may be important to the
	product candidate's success. If a competitor obtains orphan drug exclusivity for and approval of a product with the same indication as Translarna before we do and if the competitor's product is the
	same drug or a similar medicinal product as ours, we could be excluded from the market. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for Translarna for these indications, we may not be able to maintain
	it. For example, if a competitive product that is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as Translarna is shown to be clinically superior to our product candidate, any orphan drug exclusivity we
	have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity will not prevent the approval of a product that is the same drug as Translarna if the FDA
	finds that we cannot assure
	the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of the persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. The same considerations would apply to any of
	our orphan product candidates.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take over 18&nbsp;months to complete. Pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been
	obtained. We cannot predict the timing of Translarna's commercial launch in countries where we are awaiting pricing and reimbursement guidelines. While we have submitted pricing and reimbursement
	dossiers with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in key EEA countries, we have not received both pricing and reimbursement approval in these key countries on terms that are acceptable to
	us. For example, based on unsustainable economics imposed by the arbitration board in Germany upon the recent conclusion of an arbitration process with us and the German Federal Association of the
	Statutory Health Insurances (GKV-Spitzenverband), we expect to delist Translarna from the German pharmacy ordering system. Under these circumstances, patients and healthcare professionals in Germany
	may be able to access Translarna through a reimbursed importation pathway possible under German law, however, there can be no assurance that they will be successful in such an endeavor.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, the price that is approved by local governmental authorities pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes may be significantly lower than the price we are able
	to charge for sales under our reimbursed early access programs. In some instances, reimbursement may be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. In some countries,
	such as France, EAP and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under
	discussion with the applicable government health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price
	negotiations, the company may become obligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. We will make such retroactive reimbursement, if any, following the conclusion of
	price negotiations with the applicable government health authority. For example, in Germany, we were permitted under local law to sell product on a commercial basis for the one-year period commenced
	December 2014 while market access discussions were held, but we are required to reimburse payors in Germany the difference between the commercial price of Translarna and the unsustainable price
	established by the arbitration board in Germany for sales made in Germany during the period of December 2015 until such time as we delist Translarna from the German pharmacy ordering system.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political,
	economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations and there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders
	on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. For example, we have been engaged in market access discussions with National Health Services (NHS) England and
	National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) since 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2014, NHS England determined to reconsider how it assesses certain new treatments and postponed
	certain pricing and reimbursement meetings, including meetings related to Translarna, and in July 2015 determined that final funding decisions on Translarna for nmDMD will be made after the conclusion
	of a specialized appraisal process by NICE. In February 2016, we had constructive discussions with NHS England regarding a managed access agreement, pursuant to which Translarna could potentially be
	made available to qualified nmDMD patients for the period of time established under a future final agreement. However, these interim discussions regarding the managed access agreement remain subject
	to a final positive outcome from the specialized appraisal process by NICE. In addition, the potential provision of access to Translarna in England is subject to actual reimbursement decisions by NHS
	England.

	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010

	The Affordable Care Act also added a provision requiring certain providers and suppliers of services to Federal Health Care Programs
	to report and return overpayments within sixty days after they are "identified" (the "Overpayment Statute"). In February 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") released
	long-awaited regulatory guidance (in the form of a final rule) to Medicare Part&nbsp;A and Part&nbsp;B providers and suppliers regarding how to comply with the Overpayment Statute. CMS had
	previously released a final rule addressing overpayments involving Medicare Part&nbsp;C and Part&nbsp;D providers in May 2014. Although Medicare Part&nbsp;A/B/C/D providers and suppliers have
	faced federal False Claims Act liability since 2010 for failures to comply with the Overpayment Statute, these final rules interpreting the Overpayment Statute provide guidance to providers and
	suppliers regarding how to comply appropriately with applicable obligations, and guidance to government regulators and enforcement authorities regarding monitoring and prosecuting suspected
	violations. Although not directly applicable to us, this final rule may impact our customers and potential customers who are Medicare providers and suppliers.

	may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other laws, if any of our product candidates are approved,
	we would be prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means, for example, that we would not be able to make claims about the use of our marketed products outside of their

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for
	pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician
	administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of
	this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private
	payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization
	Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with our commercialization plans and business strategy, including our commercial launch of Translarna for the treatment
	of nmDMD, we have experienced and may to continue to experience significant growth in our employee base for sales, marketing, operational, managerial, financial, human resources, drug development,
	quality, regulatory and medical affairs and other areas. This growth has imposed and will continue to impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to recruit,
	hire, retain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a
	substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. To manage our recent and anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial
	systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a
	company with such growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may
	lead to significant costs and may divert our
	management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2015, we incurred indebtedness in the amount of $150.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal with additional accrued interest
	under the 3.00% convertible senior notes due August&nbsp;15, 2022, or the Convertible Notes, for which interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February&nbsp;15 and August&nbsp;15 of each
	year, beginning on February&nbsp;15, 2016. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance the Convertible Notes depends on our future performance,
	which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt,
	including the Convertible Notes. If we are unable to generate cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity
	capital on terms that may be unfavorable to us or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we seek to
	refinance such indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.

	the time we are required to repurchase Convertible Notes, to pay the Convertible Notes at maturity or to pay cash upon conversions of Convertible Notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase
	Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase
	Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture, to make interest payments on the Convertible Notes when due under the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future
	conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. An event of default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the
	perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Certain holders of an aggregate of 764,036 shares of our
	common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for
	ourselves or other stockholders.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	have issued a significant number of equity awards under our equity compensation plans or as inducement grants to new hire employees pursuant to Nasdaq rules. The shares underlying
	these awards are or, with respect to certain option grants, will be registered on a Form&nbsp;S-8 registration statement. As a result, upon vesting these shares can be freely exercised and sold in
	the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. The exercise of options and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock or the sale of restricted stock
	upon vesting could cause a decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.

	Under a Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee, director or officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from the
	employee, officer or director. A Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances. Our employees, executive officers and directors may also buy or sell additional shares

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
	the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we recognized $33.7&nbsp;million in sales of Translarna&#153; (ataluren), our lead product, for the treatment of nonsense
	mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or&nbsp;nmDMD. Translarna is currently available in over 20&nbsp;countries on a commercial basis or through a reimbursed early access program, or EAP. We hold
	worldwide commercialization rights to Translarna for all indications in all territories.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
	the evening of February&nbsp;22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regarding our New Drug Application, or NDA,
	for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. The FDA stated in the Refuse to File letter that our NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Specifically, we were notified in the
	letter that, in the view of the FDA, both the Phase&nbsp;2b and Phase&nbsp;3 ACT DMD trials were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated
	that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. We need further discussion with FDA to understand their current perspective on our
	subgroup analysis. In addition, the FDA noted that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. While other comments and requests are noted in the letter
	as items to be addressed if the NDA is resubmitted, the FDA specified that they were not related to its refusal to file our NDA. See "Item&nbsp;1. Business&#151;Marketing authorization
	matters for Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy&#151;United States" and "Item&nbsp;1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and
	our Product Candidates" for further detail regarding the Refuse to File letter and the related risks to our business.

	or&nbsp;6MWT,
	which we also refer to as 6-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, showed a 15 meter benefit in favor of Translarna (p=0.213), which did not meet statistical significance. However, we believe
	that the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data across our two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (ACT DMD and our prior Phase&nbsp;2b trial, Study 007), provide substantial
	evidence of the effectiveness of Translarna and demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Importantly, a benefit of 47 meters (nominal p=0.007) was observed
	in the pre-specified patient population with baseline 6MWD of 300 to 400 meters, which is in line with our prior experience in the Phase&nbsp;2b trial and is consistent with the evolving
	understanding of the natural history of the 6MWT in DMD patients. Translarna also showed a benefit over placebo in the 300 to 400 meter baseline 6MWD population across key secondary and tertiary
	endpoints, including timed function tests (10 meter run/walk, four stair climb, four stair descend) and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment test. In addition, a pre-specified meta-analysis of
	combined data from ACT DMD and Phase&nbsp;2b ambulatory decline phase patients, involving a total of 291 patients, demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in favor of Translarna in the
	primary endpoint of 21 meters (p=0.015) and in key secondary endpoints. The Phase&nbsp;2b ambulatory decline phase patients includes the patients from our randomized, double-blind, placebo
	controlled, Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial in patients with nmDMD who would have met the enrollment criteria of ACT DMD.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	continue to believe that the results of ACT DMD and the totality of clinical data across our two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (ACT DMD and our prior Phase&nbsp;2b
	trial, Study 007), including pre-specified analyses as well as retrospective and subgroup analyses that we have performed,
	provide strong support for concluding that Translarna is active and showed clinically meaningful benefits over placebo in these trials. However, we did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in
	either trial with the pre specified level of statistical significance and, as noted above, on February&nbsp;22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA regarding our NDA for
	Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. There is also substantial risk that the EMA and regulators in other territories may not agree with our interpretation of the results of ACT DMD and the totality
	of clinical data from our trials. For further discussion of ACT DMD, see "Item&nbsp;1. Business&#151;Completed clinical trials of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
	the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced that enrollment was completed for our global, confirmatory Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of cystic
	fibrosis caused by nonsense mutations, or nmCF. We refer to this trial as ACT CF. We anticipate top line data from ACT CF will be available in early 2017. During the third quarter of 2015, we
	submitted a variation to our marketing authorization of Translarna in the EEA, described above, to request approval of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF. We are responding to a request for
	supplementary information from the CHMP and expect a recommendation from the CHMP with respect to our variation submission in mid-2016. Our variation submission is primarily based upon the safety and
	efficacy results of our randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmCF completed in 2011,
	which we refer to as our prior Phase&nbsp;3 trial. We believe that the collective data from our prior Phase&nbsp;3 trial, including retrospective and subgroup analyses that we have performed,
	provide strong support for concluding that Translarna was active and showed clinically meaningful improvements over placebo, however, the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population did not
	achieve statistical significance. Approval of the marketing authorization variation will depend on the EMA's assessment of the relative benefits and risks of approval. We may not be able to
	demonstrate the required relative risk-benefit profile and there is substantial risk that the EMA will not grant us a variation approving Translarna for the treatment of nmCF. If approved, we expect
	that the EMA will require us, as a post-approval measure, to provide comprehensive clinical data from ACT CF to the EMA. In addition, such authorization, if granted, will continue to be subject to
	annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of Translarna, and any other product candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement
	from governments and third-party insurers. During 2015, our revenues were primarily generated from sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories where we are permitted to distribute
	Translarna under our early access programs, or EAPs, and in counties in the EEA where we were able to obtain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
	country in the EEA has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations and many countries in the EEA have other regulations related to the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical
	products in the applicable country. The pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take over 18&nbsp;months from initiation to complete. As a result, our commercial
	launch in the EEA has been, and will continue to be, on a country-by-country basis and we generally will not be able to commence commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD pursuant to
	our marketing authorization in the EEA in any particular member state of the EEA until we conclude the applicable pricing and reimbursement negotiations and comply with any licensing, employment or
	related regulatory requirements in that country. In some countries, such as France and Germany, EAP and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under
	discussion with the applicable government health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price
	negotiations, we may
	become obligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. For example, an arbitration process in German regarding pricing and reimbursement of Translarna for the
	treatment of nmDMD recently concluded. An acceptable agreement for us was not reached. As a result, we expect to delist Translarna from the German pharmacy ordering system. We are required to

	FDA and the EMA with respect to our submissions for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our ability to successfully negotiate favorable pricing and reimbursement processes on a timely basis in

	to past performance; and (3)&nbsp;the milestone be reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms of the collaboration arrangement. If these criteria are met then the contingent milestones

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2014, we were notified that the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of
	nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. The conditional marketing authorization allows us to market Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the 31 member states of European Economic
	Area. Our launch in these countries is on a country by country basis. This marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the
	European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the risk benefit balance of the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment. The authorization was further conditioned on our submission of
	the final report, including additional efficacy and safety data, from ACT DMD and our ability to implement measures, including pharmacovigilance plans that are detailed in the risk management plan for
	Translarna that was submitted to EMA. In January 2016, we submitted the final ACT DMD report to the EMA. In the third quarter of 2015, the EMA approved the annual renewal of the marketing
	authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. We plan to seek to renew the marketing authorization on an annual basis until our obligations have been fulfilled and the approval is converted
	from a conditional approval into a full approval. If we fail to satisfy such requirements, or if it is determined that the balance of risks and benefits of using Translarna changes materially, the
	European Commission could, at the EMA's recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require additional clinical trials.

	do not have sufficient history or experience from which to accurately forecast product sales or demand generation, and there continues to be substantial risk that regulators could
	suspend or not renew our marketing authorization in the future. As such, as of the date of this filing, we have not capitalized inventory. Had we capitalized all of our Translarna product that is
	available for commercial sale on hand as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the value would have been approximately $2.0&nbsp;million. In addition, had we expensed the cost of Translarna as a cost of
	sales when sold, our gross profit margin would have been greater than 90%, which we believe is consistent with the cost of producing small molecule therapeutics for orphan drug diseases in the
	pharmaceutical industry. We will continue to assess the appropriateness of inventory capitalization based on the outcome of applicable regulatory approvals.

	assumed no expected dividends for all grants. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $50.81,

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	use the "simplified method" to determine the expected term of options. Under this method, the expected term represents the average of the vesting period and the contractual term. The
	expected volatility of share options was estimated based on a historical volatility analysis of peers that were similar to us with respect to industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial
	leverage. The risk-free rate of the option is based on U.S. Government Securities Treasury Constant Maturities yields at the date of grant for a term similar to the expected term of the option.

	which we refer to as the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes bear cash interest at a rate of 3.0% per year, payable semi-annually on February&nbsp;15 and August&nbsp;15 of each year,
	beginning on February&nbsp;15, 2016. The Convertible Notes will mature on August&nbsp;15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The net proceeds to us from the offering were
	$145.4&nbsp;million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of approximately $139.6&nbsp;million and $123.3&nbsp;million,
	respectively. The change in the valuation allowance during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $16.3&nbsp;million and $9.2&nbsp;million, respectively. A full
	valuation allowance has been recorded since, in the judgment of management, these assets are not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
	the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible or are utilized. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have approximately
	$270.4&nbsp;million and $198.1&nbsp;million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	a result of realization requirements of the guidance issued by the FASB, certain deferred tax assets that arose directly from tax deductions related to equity compensation in excess
	of compensation recognized for financial reporting are excluded from the total deferred tax assets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, approximately $49.2&nbsp;million of the federal net operating loss
	carryforwards are related to the exercise of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock, and we will record a tax benefit of approximately of $16.7&nbsp;million through capital in excess
	of par value if such losses are realized.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015, credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes are approximately $11.0&nbsp;million and $4.8&nbsp;million, respectively. In addition the Orphan
	Drug Credit Carryover available as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 is approximately $39.8&nbsp;million. The federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2021, while the federal credit
	carryforwards begin to expire in 2019. State net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2030, and the state credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2016. Sections&nbsp;382 and 383 of the
	Internal Revenue Code of 1986 subject the future utilization of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes, such as research and experimental tax credits, to an annual limitation in the
	event of certain ownership changes, as defined. The Company has undergone an ownership change and has determined that a "change in ownership" as defined by IRC Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal
	Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, did occur in June of 2013. Accordingly, about $231.5&nbsp;million of the Company's NOL carryforwards are
	limited and the Company can only use $16.7&nbsp;million for the first five years from the ownership change and $5.7&nbsp;million per year going forward. Therefore, $169.2&nbsp;million of the
	NOL's will be freed up over the next 20&nbsp;years and $62.3&nbsp;million are expected to expire unused which are not included in the deferred tax assets listed above. In summary,
	there are $270.4&nbsp;million of NOLs available, out of which $169.2&nbsp;million are limited by IRC Section&nbsp;382. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, there is $142.9&nbsp;million available for
	immediate use and an additional $16.7&nbsp;million will free up in 2016.

	December&nbsp;31,
	2014. We have recorded revenue on sales where Translarna is available either on a commercial basis or through a reimbursed EAP. As of January&nbsp;1, 2015, we have recognized
	revenue for Translarna as product is shipped, given we have established a pattern of collectability. We recognized $1.4&nbsp;million of revenue in 2015 attributable to product sales in 2014 which
	were deferred in 2014 when we recognized revenue on a cash basis.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration and grant revenue was $3.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, a
	decrease of
	$21.5&nbsp;million, or 87%, from collaboration and grant revenue of $24.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The decrease in collaboration revenue was primarily due to
	milestone payments received from Roche for program achievements in the SMA program in 2014 of $17.5&nbsp;million as well as lower collaboration revenue for the comparable period.

	recognize revenue for payments received under the reimbursed early access programs for Translarna for nmDMD patients in selected countries on a cash basis until we establish a pattern of
	collectability with our product. Total invoiced revenue in 2014 was $2.5&nbsp;million, of which approximately $1.7&nbsp;million was booked as deferred revenue. Collaboration revenue was

	2013. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the recognition of the deferred revenue balance related to the amortization of approximately $16.8&nbsp;million of upfront payments from grants
	and collaborations partially offset by milestone payments received from Roche for program achievements in
	the SMA program. Grant revenue was $2.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, a decrease of $1.1&nbsp;million, or 32%, from grant revenue of $3.4&nbsp;million for the year

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	a growing commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, we are engaging in significant commercialization efforts for Translarna for nmDMD while also devoting a substantial portion of
	our efforts on research and development programs related to Translarna and our other product candidates. During 2016, we expect that our revenues will be primarily generated from sales of Translarna
	in territories where we are permitted to distribute Translarna under our reimbursed early access programs, or EAP and those counties, in particular in the EEA, where we are able to obtain pricing and
	reimbursement approval at acceptable levels.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	have historically financed our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock in public offerings, the private placements of our preferred stock,
	collaborations, bank debt, convertible debt financings and grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas
	addressed by our product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly
	from quarter to quarter.

	Phase&nbsp;2 proof-of-concept studies for nmMPS I, nonsense mutation aniridia and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5. We also expect to incur ongoing research and development expenses for our
	other product candidates, including our ongoing Phase&nbsp;1 clinical study under our cancer stem cell program. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in connection with our efforts to resolve
	the issues raised by the FDA in its Refuse to File letter regarding our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our efforts to advance our regulatory submissions, including our recent
	submissions with the EMA related to our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and our marketing authorization variation submission with the EMA, which seeks to include
	Translarna for the treatment of nmCF. We have begun seeking and intend to continue to seek marketing approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the EEA and we may
	also seek marketing approval for Translarna for other indications, and these efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization expenses.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and sustain profitability, and we may never do so. We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our
	continuing operations. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through a combination of equity offerings, debt
	financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our
	product and product candidates and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we
	raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or
	other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take
	specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing,
	distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant
	licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity,
	which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term securities. Our
	available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. At any time, sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the
	investment portfolio and its interest earnings. After a review of our marketable investment securities, we believe that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates, the
	resulting decrease in fair value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the consolidated financial statements. Currently, we do not hedge these interest rate exposures.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	a result of our foreign operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, including the British Pound, Euro and Swiss Franc against the U.S. dollar. The
	current exposures arise primarily from cash, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables and payables, and product sales denominated in foreign currencies. Both positive and negative impacts to our
	international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates may be partially mitigated by the natural, opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international
	operating expenses. A hypothetical ten percent increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British Pound, Euro or Swiss Franc from the December&nbsp;31, 2015 rate would
	cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities to change by an insignificant amount. We are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities. We will evaluate the use of
	derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure as the needs and risks should arise.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
	the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
	over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
	performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
	company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
	financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
	that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
	expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
	detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
	of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
	periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PTC Therapeutics,&nbsp;Inc. (the Company or PTC) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on March&nbsp;31, 1998. PTC is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the
	discovery, development and commercialization of orally administered, small molecule therapeutics targeting an area of RNA biology referred to as post-transcriptional control. The letters "PTC" in the
	corporate name are an acronym for post-transcriptional control processes, which are the regulatory events that occur in cells during and after a messenger RNA is copied from DNA through the
	transcription process. The Company has discovered all of its compounds currently under development using its proprietary technologies. The Company plans to continue to develop these compounds both on
	its own and through selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The Company believes that systematically targeting post-transcriptional control
	processes represents an unexploited approach to drug discovery and development. The Company's internally discovered pipeline addresses multiple therapeutic areas, including rare disorders and
	oncology.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
	the evening of February&nbsp;22, 2016, the Company received a Refuse to File letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regarding its New Drug Application,
	or NDA, for its lead product, Translarna&#153; (ataluren), for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or nmDMD. The FDA stated in the Refuse to File letter that the NDA
	was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Specifically, the Company was notified in the letter that, in the view of the FDA, both the Phase&nbsp;2b and Phase&nbsp;3 ACT DMD
	trials were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. Additionally, the FDA stated that the Company had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a
	majority of enrolled patients. In addition, the FDA noted that the NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. While other comments and requests are noted in
	the letter as items to be addressed if the NDA is resubmitted, the FDA specified that they were not related to its refusal to file the NDA.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translarna
	received marketing authorization from the European Commission, or EC, in August 2014 for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients age 5&nbsp;years and over in the 31
	member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA. nmDMD is a rare, life threatening disorder. The marketing authorization was primarily based upon the safety and efficacy results of our 48-week,
	174-patient
	Phase&nbsp;2b double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmDMD completed in 2009, or the Phase&nbsp;2b trial.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company's authorization in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the EC following reassessment by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the risk benefit balance of
	the authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment. This marketing authorization was further conditioned on the Company's ability to complete its global, confirmatory Phase&nbsp;3
	clinical trial in nmDMD, which the Company refers to as ACT DMD, and submit the final report, including additional efficacy and safety data from the trial. The Company submitted this final report to
	the EMA in January 2016 and requested that the condition to our marketing authorization be removed. The Company expects that the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, will
	issue a recommendation regarding this request in mid-2016.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	June 2014, the Company initiated a reimbursed expanded access program, or EAP program, for Translarna for nmDMD patients in selected territories in the EEA and recorded its first
	sales of Translarna in the third quarter of 2014 pursuant to the EAP program. In December 2014, the Company recorded its first commercial sales in Germany. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, Translarna
	was available in 17 countries on a commercial basis or pursuant to the EAP program. The Company expects to expand its launch activities across the EEA pursuant to the marketing authorization granted
	by the EMA throughout 2016 and future years, subject to continued renewal of its marketing authorization following annual EMA reassessments and successful completion of pricing and reimbursement
	negotiations. Concurrently, the Company plans to continue to pursue EAP programs in select countries where those mechanisms exist, both within the EEA and in other countries.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	October 2015, the Company announced results from ACT DMD, including that the trial did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline at week 48 in distance walked in
	the 6-minute walk test, or 6MWT, which the Company also refers to as six-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, in the overall intent-to-treat, or ITT, study population, as it showed a 15 meter benefit
	(p=0.213) in favor of Translarna compared to placebo, which was not statistically significant. Analyses of data from pre-specified subgroups, including patients with baseline 6MWD of
	300&nbsp;-&nbsp;400 meters, was also conducted. A pre-specified meta-analysis was also performed of combined data from the ACT DMD and ambulatory decline phase patients from the Company's
	randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmDMD, or the Phase&nbsp;2b trial.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
	2015, the Company's revenues have been and are expected to be primarily generated from sales of Translarna in counties in the EEA where pricing and reimbursement approval is
	obtained at acceptable levels and in other territories where the Company is permitted to distribute Translarna under reimbursed early access programs, or EAPs. The Company is subject to a number of
	risks similar
	to those of other early stage companies, including dependence on key individuals, the difficulties inherent in the development of commercially usable products, the potential need to obtain additional
	capital necessary to fund the development of its products, and competition from other companies. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately
	$593.0&nbsp;million. The Company has financed its operations to date primarily through the private offering in August 2015 of 3.00% convertible senior notes due 2022 (see Note&nbsp;6), public
	offerings of common stock in February 2014 and October 2014, its initial public offering of common stock in June 2013, private placements of its convertible preferred stock, collaborations, bank debt,
	convertible debt financings, grant funding and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease area addressed by the Company's
	product candidates.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to credit risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale

	any credit losses in these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. The Company's investment policy includes guidelines on the quality of the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2014, the Company was notified that the European Commission, or EC, granted conditional marketing authorization for Translarna for
	the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. The conditional marketing authorization allows the Company to market Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the 31 member
	states of the European Economic Area. The launch in these countries is on a country by country basis. This marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the EC following
	reassessment by the EMA of the risk benefit balance of the authorization. The authorization was further conditioned on the Company's submission of the final report, including additional efficacy and
	safety data, from ACT DMD and the Company's ability to implement measures, including pharmacovigilance plans that are detailed in the risk management plan for Translarna that was submitted to EMA. In
	January 2016, the Company submitted the final ACT DMD report to the EMA. In the third quarter of 2015, the EMA approved the annual renewal of the marketing authorization for Translarna for the
	treatment of nmDMD. The Company plans to seek to renew the marketing authorization on an annual basis until the Company's obligations have been fulfilled and the approval is converted from a
	conditional approval into a full approval. If the Company fails to satisfy such requirements, or if it is determined that the balance of risks and benefits of using Translarna changes materially, the

	could, at the EMA's recommendation, vary, suspend, withdraw or refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna or require additional clinical trials. The Company does not have sufficient

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company has recorded revenue on sales where Translarna is available either on a commercial basis or through a reimbursed EAP program. Orders for Translarna are generally received
	from hospital and retail pharmacies and, in some cases, one of the Company's third-party partner distributors. The Company's third-party distributors act as intermediaries between the Company and end
	users and do not typically stock significant quantities of Translarna. The ultimate payor for Translarna is typically a government authority or institution or a third-party health insurer. Prior to
	January&nbsp;1, 2015, the Company generally recognized revenue for these reimbursed EAP programs once the product was shipped on behalf of the government authority or institution on a cash basis if
	all other revenue recognition criteria had been met. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, the Company has recognized revenue for Translarna as product is shipped, as the Company has established a
	pattern of collectability.

	Company evaluates all contingent consideration earned, such as a milestone payment, using the criteria as provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), guidance on the
	milestone method of revenue recognition. At the inception of a collaboration arrangement, the Company evaluates if a milestone payment is substantive. The criteria requires that (1)&nbsp;the Company
	determines if the milestone is commensurate with either its performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value resulting from our activities to achieve the milestone; (2)&nbsp;the
	milestone be related to past performance; and (3)&nbsp;the milestone be reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms of the collaboration arrangement. If these criteria are met then the
	contingent milestones can be considered a substantive milestone and will be recognized as revenue in the period that the milestone is achieved. The Company recognizes royalties as earned in accordance
	with the terms of various research and collaboration agreements. If not substantive, the contingent consideration is allocated to the existing units of accounting based on relative selling price and

	present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the assets. Although current and historical negative cash flows are indicators of impairment, management believes the future cash flows
	to be received from the long-lived assets and the potential success of the Company's research programs will exceed the assets' carrying value, and accordingly, the Company believes that no impairment
	of long-lived assets exists as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the entire award. For awards that vest or begin vesting upon achievement of
	a performance condition, the Company estimates the likelihood of satisfaction of the performance condition and recognizes compensation expense when achievement of the performance condition is deemed

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrealized
	gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in stockholders' equity. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the
	Company did not have any realized gains/losses from the sale of marketable securities. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The Company evaluates investments
	with unrealized losses to determine if the losses are other than temporary. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company held securities with an unrealized loss position that were not considered to be
	other-than-temporarily impaired as the Company has the ability to hold such investments until recovery of their fair value. In addition, the Company considered the financial condition, credit ratings
	and near-term prospects of the issuers, and the magnitude of the losses as compared to the cost and the length of time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position when determining if the
	losses are other than temporary.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2015, the Company issued $150.0&nbsp;million of 3.0% convertible senior notes due August&nbsp;15, 2022 (the "Convertible
	Notes"). Interest is payable semi-annually on February&nbsp;15 and August&nbsp;15 of each year, beginning on February&nbsp;15, 2016. The Company separately accounted for the liability and equity
	components of the Convertible Notes by allocating the proceeds between the liability component and equity component, as further discussed in Note&nbsp;6. The fair value of the Convertible Notes,
	which differs from their carrying values, is influenced by interest rates, the Company's stock price and stock price volatility and is determined by prices for the Convertible Notes observed in market
	trading which are Level&nbsp;2 inputs. The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes at December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $150.0&nbsp;million.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrant liability is classified in Other long-term liabilities on the Company's balance sheet. The warrant liability is
	marked-to-market each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded as a gain or loss within Other income/(expense) on the Company's statement of operations until the warrants are exercised,
	expire or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liability to be reclassified as an equity instrument. The fair value of the warrant liability is determined at each reporting period by
	utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2009, the Company entered into a $25.0&nbsp;million secured debt facility with a syndicate of two lenders. The Company
	borrowed $12.5&nbsp;million under the facility in September 2009 and an additional $10.0&nbsp;million under the facility in December 2010 and issued the lenders promissory notes. The notes were
	secured by substantially all of the Company's assets except for intellectual property. In July 2013, the Company paid in full the outstanding principal and interest of $2.6&nbsp;million due under
	the promissory notes issued in connection with the secured debt facility. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.1&nbsp;million on the Company's
	statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The loss on extinguishment of debt primarily represented the write off of related deferred financing costs, the acceleration of
	recognition of debt extinguishment fees and the prepayment premium payable.

	accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company separated the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by
	measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by
	deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount,
	referred to as the debt discount, is amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of the Convertible Notes. The equity component is not re-measured as long as it continues to meet the
	conditions for equity classification.

	transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted with the equity components in stockholders' equity. Additionally, the Company initially recorded a net deferred tax liability of

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During January and February of 2013, the Company entered into a "bridge" financing arrangement with certain existing investors
	providing for the issuance by the Company of an aggregate of $6&nbsp;million of convertible promissory notes and warrants to purchase 2,527,675 shares of Series One and Series Two convertible
	preferred stock. The warrants have a per share exercise price of $0.01, and as such, they are referred to as "penny warrants". This bridge financing was closed in anticipation of the March 2013 Series
	Four financing event, which the Company refers to as the "2013 recapitalization".

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company allocated the proceeds of the convertible promissory notes between debt and warrant liability. Since the value of the warrants exceeded the proceeds from the convertible
	notes issued to existing investors, the value of the warrant in excess of the proceeds is considered a deemed dividend and reflected as an equity transaction in the financial statements. The Company
	recorded $6.0&nbsp;million to interest expense related to the debt discount associated with the convertible debt during the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2013.

	approximately $54&nbsp;million. Including the $6.0&nbsp;million raised with the bridge financing, total gross proceeds raised during the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2013 was approximately

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

	Series One, Series Two and Series Three convertible preferred stock. The gain of approximately $3.4&nbsp;million represents the excess of the Series One, Series Two and Series Three convertible

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&#151;The value of the Company was estimated using the PWERM. The PWERM considered the most significant near-term driver of value for the Company
	as the Company's ability to complete a Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial of ataluren for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy caused
	by nonsense mutations (nmDMD). The remaining scenarios in the PWERM related to funding the completion of the Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial for nmDMD. The path to raising this money made up the
	remaining nodes in the PWERM.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
	identifying the various potential liquidity scenarios and their likely timing, a pre-money enterprise value was assigned to each scenario based on a combination of management's
	guidance and recent trends in the capital markets. The resulting enterprise value for each liquidity event was divided by the total shares that would be outstanding under each scenario to arrive at a
	price per share for the common and preferred classes of stock. Each scenario was then assigned an outcome probability based on management's estimates. The resulting probability weighted share values
	were then discounted to present value at a rate that reflects general industry risks (but not Company specific risks).

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2011, the Company and the SMA Foundation entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with Roche for a spinal
	muscular atrophy program. Under the terms of the agreement, Roche acquired an exclusive worldwide license to the Company's spinal muscular atrophy program, which includes three compounds currently in
	preclinical development, as well as potential back-up compounds. The Company received a nonrefundable upfront cash payment of $30.0&nbsp;million during the research term, which was terminated
	effective December&nbsp;31, 2014, Roche provided us with funding, based on an agreed- upon full-time equivalent rate, for an agreed-upon number of full- time equivalent employees that we contributed
	to the research program.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company applied the multiple element revenue recognition guidance in evaluating the accounting treatment of this collaboration agreement. The Company identified two possible
	significant deliverables in the collaboration agreement, the license and the research activities. The Company evaluated whether
	these significant deliverables have stand-alone value and determined that the license does not have standalone value without the ongoing research and development services given the unique nature of
	the technology. As such, both of these elements were combined as a single unit for accounting purposes. As a result, the Company deferred the $30.0&nbsp;million upfront payment which was recognized
	over the estimated performance period of two years, which was the contracted research period. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized approximately
	$0.6&nbsp;million, $20.2&nbsp;million and $26.6&nbsp;million respectively, in collaboration revenue. The balance of the remaining deferred upfront payment was fully recognized as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2013.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
	the agreement, the Company is eligible to receive additional payments from Roche if specified events are achieved with respect to each licensed product, including up to
	$135.0&nbsp;million in research and development event milestones, up to $325.0&nbsp;million in sales milestones upon achievement of sales events, and up to double digit royalties on worldwide
	annual net sales of a commercial product.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company considers that each of the potential milestone events under the agreement would be substantive because the applicable criteria of its revenue recognition policy (see
	Note&nbsp;2) would be satisfied.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	January 2014, the Company announced the initiation of a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical program in its spinal muscular atrophy collaboration with Roche and the SMA Foundation which triggered
	a $7.5&nbsp;million milestone payment from Roche. The Company considered this milestone event substantive because the applicable criteria of its revenue recognition policy would be satisfied and
	recorded it as collaboration revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, the Company has arrangements with several organizations pursuant to which the Company uses its discovery
	technologies to help identify potential drug candidates. The Company does not take ownership of the potential compounds, but rather provides research services to the collaborator using its specialized
	technology platform.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
	these arrangements are structured such that the collaborator and the Company work together to jointly select targets from which to apply its discovery technologies. The
	research period for the Company to apply its technology is generally three to four years. The Company will typically receive a nonrefundable, upfront cash payment and the collaborator agrees to
	provide funding for research activities performed on its behalf.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company applies multiple element revenue recognition guidance in evaluating the accounting treatment for these arrangements. Generally, the two significant deliverables in these
	arrangements are the license and the research activities. The Company evaluates whether the deliverables have standalone value. Since the Company's discovery technologies are highly specialized, the
	Company has generally determined that the license does not have standalone value without the ongoing research and development services and generally accounts for these arrangements as a single unit of
	accounting.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	a result, the Company had deferred revenue of $1.8&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 related to these arrangements. There was no deferred revenue related to these
	arrangements as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized approximately $1.8&nbsp;million and $1.3&nbsp;million in collaboration
	revenue, respectively.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company is eligible to receive additional payments from its early stage discovery research arrangements if the discovery compounds are ultimately developed and commercialized. The
	aggregate potential payments the Company is eligible for if all products are developed is $143.0&nbsp;million and up to $252.0&nbsp;million in sales milestones upon achievement of specified sales
	events and up to double digit royalties on worldwide annual net sales of the licensed product.

	the amount is deferred and recognized as revenue as the expenditures are incurred.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets of approximately $139.6&nbsp;million and
	$123.3&nbsp;million, respectively. The change in the valuation allowance during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $16.3&nbsp;million and $9.2&nbsp;million,
	respectively. A full valuation allowance has been recorded since, in the judgment of management, these assets are not more likely than not to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
	assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible or are utilized. As of December&nbsp;31,
	2015, the Company has approximately $270.4&nbsp;million and $198.1&nbsp;million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	a result of realization requirements of the guidance issued by the FASB, certain deferred tax assets that arose directly from tax deductions related to equity compensation in excess
	of compensation recognized for financial reporting are excluded from the total deferred tax assets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, approximately $49.2 million of the federal net operating loss
	carryforwards are related to the exercise of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock, and the Company will record a tax benefit of approximately of $16.7 million through capital in
	excess of par value if such losses are realized.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015, research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes are approximately $11.0&nbsp;million and $4.8&nbsp;million, respectively.
	In addition, the Orphan Drug Credit Carryover available as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 is approximately $39.8&nbsp;million. The federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2021,
	while the federal credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2019. State net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2030, and the state credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2016.
	Sections&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 subject the future utilization of net operating losses and certain other tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits,
	to an annual limitation in the event of certain ownership changes, as defined. The Company has undergone an ownership change and has determined that a "change in ownership" as defined by IRC
	Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, did occur in June of 2013. Accordingly, about $231.5&nbsp;million of the
	Company's NOL carryforwards are limited and the Company can only use $16.7&nbsp;million for the first five years from the ownership change and $5.7&nbsp;million per year going forward. Therefore,
	$169.2&nbsp;million of the NOL's will be freed up over the next 20&nbsp;years and $62.3&nbsp;million are expected to expire unused which are not included in the deferred tax
	assets listed above. In summary, there are $270.4&nbsp;million of NOLs available, out of which $169.2&nbsp;million are limited by IRC Section&nbsp;382. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, there is
	$142.9&nbsp;million available for immediate use and an additional $16.7&nbsp;million will free up in 2016.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	income tax expense and benefit for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 34% to loss
	before tax expense and benefit as a result of foreign taxes, nondeductible expenses, tax credits generated, true up of net operating loss carryforwards, and increases in the Company's valuation
	allowance. The Company applies the elements of FASB ASC 740-10 regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. This
	clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and required impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more
	likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 the company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and has not accrued any interest or penalties through
	2015. The Company does not expect to have any unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to tax matters within the
	income tax provision. Tax years beginning in 2012 are generally subject to examination by taxing authorities, although net operating losses from all years are subject to examinations and adjustments
	for at least three years following the year in which the attributes are used.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
	all years through December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company generated research credits but has not conducted a study to document the qualified activities. This study may result in an
	adjustment to the Company's research and development credit carryforwards; however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.
	A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company's research and development credits and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the deferred
	tax asset established for the research and development credit carryforwards and the valuation allowance.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under various agreements, the Company will be required to pay royalties and milestone payments upon the successful development and
	commercialization of products. The Company has entered into funding agreements with The Wellcome Trust Limited (Wellcome Trust) for the research and development of small molecule compounds. To the
	extent that the Company develops and commercializes program intellectual property on a for-profit basis, it may become obligated to pay to Wellcome Trust development and regulatory milestone payments
	of up to an aggregate of $68.9&nbsp;million and single-digit royalties on sales of any research program product. The Company's obligation to pay such royalties would continue on a country-by-country
	basis until the longer of the expiration of the last patent in the program intellectual property in such country covering the research program product and the expiration of market exclusivity of such
	product in such country. The Company's first such milestone payment of $0.8&nbsp;million payable to Wellcome Trust is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2016.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
</B>

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer
	(principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The term "disclosure controls and procedures", as defined in
	Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
	information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
	the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
	reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate
	to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
	achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
	at the reasonable assurance level.

	Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
	Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's
	principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
	financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of
	records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
	recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of our company are being made only
	in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
	or disposition of our company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal
	control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
	prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
	misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
	of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
