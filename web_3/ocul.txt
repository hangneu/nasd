	We are a biopharmaceutical
	company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using our proprietary hydrogel platform technology. Our bioresorbable hydrogel-based product candidates are designed to provide
	sustained delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye. Our hydrogel is a bioresorbable proprietary formulation of polyethylene glycol, or PEG, which when constituted with water takes on a gelatinous consistency. The product candidates in our
	development pipeline have the potential to overcome many of the significant limitations of existing eye drop based therapies for ophthalmic diseases and conditions affecting the front of the eye by replacing the current standard of care regimen of
	weeks or months of eye drop therapy with as little as a single product application. Our lead product candidates are DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, sustained-release, drug-eluting intracanalicular depots which are inserted into the canaliculus through a
	natural opening called the punctum located in the inner portion of the eyelid near the nose. Our intracanalicular depots (also referred to as drug-eluting depots or sustained-release depots) combine our hydrogel technology with U.S. Food and Drug
	Administration, or FDA, approved therapeutic agents with the goal of providing sustained delivery of drug to the eye. We also have an intravitreal hydrogel depot, which is in preclinical development for the treatment of diseases and conditions of
	the back of the eye, including wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. Our intravitreal depot is designed to be delivered via intravitreal injection to release therapeutic agents, such as antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor,
	or VEGF, over a sustained period. In addition to our ongoing product development, we have launched our first commercial product, ReSure Sealant, a hydrogel-based ophthalmic wound sealant approved by the FDA in 2014 to seal corneal incisions
	following cataract surgery.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Poor patient compliance with eye drop regimens and the need for frequent administration of eye drops at high
	drug concentrations due to rapid washout by the tears can create challenges in the successful management of ocular diseases and conditions. For example, poor patient compliance can lead to diminished efficacy and disease progression and high drug
	concentrations can create side effects. We are developing therapies to replace standard of care eye drop regimens with our innovative sustained-release, drug-eluting intracanalicular depots, which we formerly referred to as punctum plugs. Our
	intracanalicular depots are designed to release a therapeutic agent to the surface of the eye over an extended period. The goal for our intracanalicular depot product candidates is to change the management of many front-of-the-eye diseases and
	conditions from frequent, pulsed eye drop therapy, characterized by significant variations in drug concentration over time, to longer term, sustained delivery of therapeutic agents to improve patient outcomes.

	Our most advanced product candidate, DEXTENZA, incorporates the FDA-approved corticosteroid dexamethasone as an active pharmaceutical
	ingredient into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting intracanalicular depot. DEXTENZA is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. In September 2015, we submitted to the FDA a New Drug Application, or
	NDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. The FDA has accepted the NDA for filing and established a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, of July&nbsp;24, 2016. We have completed two Phase 3
	clinical trials of DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. The data from these two completed Phase 3 clinical trials and a prior Phase 2 clinical trial are being used to support our NDA for post-surgical ocular pain. In October
	2015, we initiated a third Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. We expect to have topline efficacy data available from this third trial in the second half of 2016. If the results from this third
	trial are favorable and subject to receiving approval for the pain indication pursuant to the initial NDA, we plan to submit an NDA supplement for DEXTENZA for the treatment of
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	ocular
	inflammation. DEXTENZA is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. In October 2015, we announced topline results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis. We initiated enrollment of
	our second Phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis in November 2015. Finally, DEXTENZA is in Phase 2

	In addition to DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, we are engaged in the preclinical development of our intravitreal hydrogel depot administered via
	intravitreal injection to address the large and growing markets for diseases and conditions of the back of the eye. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our sustained-release hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic
	drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs, such as TKIs, for the treatment of wet AMD. Our initial goal for this program is to provide sustained release of an anti-angiogenic protein or a TKI drug over a
	four to six month period following administration of a bioresorbable hydrogel incorporating the drug by an injection into the vitreous humor, thereby reducing the frequency of the current monthly or bi-monthly intravitreal injection regimen for wet
	AMD and other back-of-the-eye diseases. We also have a pipeline of earlier stage intracanalicular depot product candidates, including OTX-MP, which has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics in patients following
	cataract surgery.

	Following our receipt of FDA approval for ReSure Sealant, we commercially launched this product in the United States in
	2014 through a network of ophthalmology focused distributors. ReSure Sealant is approved to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery and is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use. In the pivotal
	clinical trials that formed the basis for FDA approval, ReSure Sealant provided superior wound closure and a better safety profile than sutured closure. We plan to use the limited revenues we expect from sales of ReSure Sealant to contribute to the
	funding of our product development pipeline and commercialization efforts.

	Our clinical stage product candidates and our marketed product
	are based on a proprietary bioresorbable hydrogel technology platform that uses PEG as a key component. Bioresorbable materials gradually break down in the body into non-toxic, water soluble compounds that are cleared by normal biological processes.
	PEG is used in many pharmaceutical products and is widely considered to be safe and biocompatible. Our technology platform allows us to tailor the physical properties, drug release profiles and bioresorption rates of our hydrogels to meet the needs
	of specific clinical indications. We have used this platform to engineer each of our intracanalicular depot product candidates, ReSure Sealant and our intravitreal depot. Our technical capabilities include a deep understanding of the polymer
	chemistry of PEG-based hydrogels and the design of the specialized manufacturing processes required to achieve a reliable, preservative free and pure product.

	We are directing all of our development efforts towards applying our proprietary PEG-based bioresorbable hydrogel technology platform to product candidates that are designed to provide sustained delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye using active
	pharmaceutical ingredients that are currently used in ophthalmic drugs approved by the FDA and that are or are expected to become available on a generic basis prior to anticipated launch dates. Our technology uses a proprietary composition of PEG to
	make bioresorbable hydrogels that we specifically engineer for each of our product candidates. By focusing on the development of products based on FDA-approved therapeutic agents, we believe that we can advance potential products efficiently and
	predictably through the development cycle based on well-defined clinical and regulatory approval pathways. We believe this strategy of selecting FDA-approved therapeutic agents and improving their delivery represents an attractive risk-reward
	profile relative to new drug development.

	Improve patient compliance and management of front-of-the-eye diseases and conditions by replacing standard of care eye drop therapies with our intracanalicular depot product candidates

	. We are designing and
	developing innovative product candidates to address large markets that are currently served by a variety of competing products, all of which we believe have limitations. We are directing a significant portion of our efforts to address many of the
	limitations of eye drops, while still delivering the drugs to the ocular surface. Our technology platform enables sustained drug delivery to the eye, which we believe can lead to increased compliance, enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects for
	our product candidates as compared to existing therapies. We are designing our sustained delivery product candidates so that following a single administration of our drug-eluting intracanalicular depot for an acute condition or administration every
	several months for chronic conditions, a patient can receive continuous exposure to a therapeutic agent over a sustained period.

	The front of the human eye possesses focusing elements, consisting of the cornea on the surface of the eye, the lens and the aqueous humor,
	which is a transparent gelatinous fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers between the lens and the cornea. The tissue surrounding the eye also serves important functions. There is a natural opening, called a punctum, located in the
	inner portion of each eyelid near the nose. The puncta open into nasolacrimal ducts, which collect and drain tears. The conjunctiva is the membrane covering the inside of the eyelids and the white part of the eye. It helps to protect the eye from
	microbes and to lubricate the eye. The back of the eye contains the retina, which is the light sensing layer of tissue, the vitreous humor, which is a transparent gel that fills the vitreous chamber between the lens and the retina, and the optic
	nerve, which transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. Eye disease can be caused by many factors and can affect both the front and back of the eye. Diseases and conditions affecting the front of the eye are generally treated either
	with surgery or with medications delivered to the ocular surface by eye drops. Intravitreal injections are typically used to deliver medications to the back of the eye.

	Ocular inflammation and pain are common side effects following ophthalmic surgery. Frequently performed ophthalmic surgeries include cataract,
	refractive vitreoretinal, cornea and glaucoma procedures. Physicians prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, which are typically administered through eye drops multiple times per day, following ocular surgery as the standard of
	care. These drugs improve patient comfort and also accelerate recovery through disruption of the inflammatory cascade resulting in decreased inflammation and reduced activity of the immune system. Physicians also frequently prescribe non-steroidal
	anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, as adjunctive or combination therapy to supplement the use of corticosteroids. If left untreated, inflammation of the eye may result in further ocular complications, including pain, scarring and vision loss.

	Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva resulting primarily from a reaction to allergy-causing substances such as
	pollen or pet dander. The primary sign of this inflammation is redness and the primary symptom is acute itching. Allergic conjunctivitis ranges in clinical severity from relatively mild, common forms to more severe forms that can cause impaired
	vision. According to a study on the management of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis published in 2012 in the peer-reviewed journal
<I>
	Acta Ophthalmologica
</I>
	, allergic conjunctivitis affects 15% to 40% of the U.S. population. The first line of
	defense against allergic conjunctivitis is avoidance of the allergen. If this is not successful, physicians typically prescribe a mast cell stabilizer or antihistamine. These treatments act to reduce the signs and symptoms of the early phase
	allergic reaction. For the subset of patients with chronic or more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis, antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers are often not sufficient to treat their signs and symptoms. These refractory patients are frequently
	treated with topical corticosteroids administered by eye drops.

	Dry eye disease affects the ocular surface and is characterized by dryness, inflammation, pain, discomfort and irritation. The current standard
	of care for moderate to severe dry eye disease is the use of artificial tears and topical anti-inflammatory and immune modulating drugs administered by eye drops. The anti-inflammatory and immune modulating prescription drug market for the treatment
	of moderate to severe dry eye disease consists of Restasis, marketed by Allergan, and off-label use of corticosteroids and NSAIDs. Restasis is an ophthalmic formulation of the immune modulating drug cyclosporine. Restasis is a topical
	immunomodulator indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Based on our review of industry sources, we estimate that
	approximately 20&nbsp;million people in the United States have dry eye disease, including approximately five million people who suffer from moderate to severe dry eye disease.

	Glaucoma
	is a progressive and highly individualized disease in which elevated levels of intraocular pressure are associated with damage to the optic nerve, which results in irreversible vision loss. According to the World Health Organization, glaucoma is the

	In a healthy eye, fluid is continuously produced and drained to maintain pressure equilibrium and provide nutrients to the ocular tissue.
	Excess fluid production or insufficient drainage of fluid in the front of the eye or a combination of these problems causes increased intraocular pressure. The increased intraocular pressure associated with uncontrolled glaucoma results in
	degeneration of the optic nerve in the back of the eye. Once glaucoma develops, it is a chronic condition that requires life-long treatment. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, approximately 2.2&nbsp;million people in the United States
	suffer from glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma, in which the space between the iris and the cornea through which fluid drains is relatively wide, is the most common form of glaucoma. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, open-angle glaucoma
	accounts for at least 90% of all glaucoma cases.

	In order to lower intraocular pressure, physicians typically initiate treatment by
	prescribing drugs administered as eye drops. These drugs either decrease fluid production or enhance fluid drainage. The classes of topical drugs used to treat glaucoma include prostaglandin analogs, or PGAs, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists
	and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. PGAs are the most widely prescribed class of drugs for glaucoma and are considered first-line glaucoma treatment. PGAs reduce intraocular pressure by enhancing the clearance and drainage of ocular fluid. The most
	frequently prescribed PGA is once-daily latanoprost, although travoprost, unoprostone and bimatoprost are also frequently used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. In cases where glaucoma is not easily managed by a drug regimen, surgical or

	. Eye drops require frequent administration. For example, steroids for ophthalmic use require administration as frequently as four to six times daily and require tapered dosing over the

	Need for high concentrations
</I>
	. After eye drops are administered to the ocular surface, the tear film rapidly renews. Most topically applied solutions are washed away by new tear fluid within 15 to 30 seconds.
	Because contact time with the ocular surface is short, less than 5% of the applied dose&nbsp;actually penetrates to reach intraocular tissues. As a result, eye drops generally require frequent administration at high drug concentrations to deliver a
	meaningful amount of drug to the eye. This pulsed therapy results in significant variations in drug concentrations over a treatment period, which we refer to as peak and valley dosing. At peak levels, the high concentrations can result in side
	effects, such as burning, stinging, redness of the clear membrane covering the white part of the eye, referred to as hyperemia, and spikes in intraocular pressure, which may lead to drug- induced glaucoma. At low concentration levels, the drug may
	not be effective, thus allowing the disease to progress.

	There are a range of back-of-the-eye diseases and conditions that adversely affect vision. One of the principal back-of-the-eye conditions is
	wet AMD, a serious disease of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula that is responsible for detailed central vision and color perception. Wet AMD is characterized by abnormal new blood vessel formation, referred to as
	neovascularization, which results in blood vessel leakage and retinal distortion. If untreated, neovascularization in wet AMD patients typically results in formation of a scar under the macular region of the retina. The current standard of care for
	wet AMD are drugs that target VEGF, one of several proteins involved in neovascularization.

	Wet AMD is the leading cause of blindness in
	people over the age of 55 in the United States and the European Union. According to a study on the burden of AMD published in 2006 in the peer-reviewed journal
<I>
	Current Opinion in Ophthalmology
</I>
	, approximately 1.2&nbsp;million people in the
	United States suffer from wet AMD. In addition, AMD Alliance International reports that approximately 200,000 new cases of wet AMD arise each year in the United States. The incidence of wet AMD increases substantially with age, and we expect that
	the number of cases of wet AMD will increase with growth of the elderly population in the United States. The
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	anti-VEGF
</FONT>
	market for the treatment of wet AMD consists predominantly of two drugs that are approved
	for marketing and primarily prescribed for the treatment of wet AMD, Lucentis marketed in the United States by Genentech and Eylea marketed in the United States by Regeneron, and off-label use of the cancer therapy Avastin. In 2014, sales of
	Lucentis and Eylea totaled approximately $3.5 billion in the United States.

	Because eye drops are unable to carry effective drug
	concentrations to the back-of-the-eye, intravitreal injections are used to deliver medications to this location. However, the frequency of intravitreal injections can be a significant burden on patients, caregivers and clinicians. For example, the
	current treatment protocol for wet AMD involves monthly or bi-monthly injections. Intravitreal injections can lead to patient discomfort, a transient increase in intraocular pressure, and ocular inflammation and infection. Although serious adverse
	event rates after treatment with anti-VEGF compounds are low, intravitreal injections can result in severe complications and damage to the retina and other structures of the eye, such as ocular hemorrhage and tears in the retinal pigment epithelium.

	According to

	A cataract is a clouding of the lens inside the front of the eye. During cataract surgery, a patient&#146;s cloudy natural lens is removed and
	replaced with a prosthetic intraocular lens. Clear corneal incisions that allow entry to the eye are the preferred method for performing cataract surgery. The most common post-surgical approach is to allow the incisions to self-seal, or close,
	through normal biological processes. However, self-sealing incisions can open spontaneously, especially within 12 to 24 hours following surgery, when intraocular pressure fluctuates or as a result of the application of external pressure or
	manipulation. In addition, incisions that are left to self-seal are often associated with fluid leakage, which can sometimes result in complications. Complications from fluid leakage include the development of hypotony, or low intraocular pressure,
	which can lead to corneal decompensation and vision loss, as well as the potential for infection. The implanted intraocular lens also may shift in position due to hypotony, leading to poor visual outcomes following surgery.

	Sutures are the most widely used alternative method of wound closure. However, sutures do not completely prevent fluid leakage, are
	time-consuming to place and have been associated with patient discomfort and corneal distortion. An additional visit may be required to remove sutures, thus adding time, inconvenience and expense to the surgical process. Sutures may also lead to
	astigmatism, a distortion of the cornea that can result from improper suture technique. These shortcomings limit the use of sutures in ophthalmic surgery. In a 2012 survey

	We create our hydrogels by cross-linking PEG molecules to form a network that resembles a three-dimensional mesh on a molecular level. Our PEG
	molecules are branched, with four to eight branches or arms. Each arm bears a reactive site on its end. Our cross-linking chemistry uses a second molecule with four arms, bearing complimentary reactive sites on each end, such that when combined with
	the PEG molecules, a network spontaneously forms. When swollen with water, this molecular network forms a hydrogel. We design these hydrogels to slowly degrade in the presence of water, a process called hydrolysis, by inserting a biodegradable
	linkage between the PEG molecule and the cross-linked molecule. By appropriately selecting the number of arms of the PEG molecule and the biodegradable linkage, we can design hydrogels with varying mechanical properties and bioresorption rates.
	Because the body has an abundance of water at a constant temperature and pH level, hydrolysis provides a predictable and reproducible degradation rate. Our technology enables us to make hydrogels that can bioresorb over days, weeks or several
	months. The figure below depicts the formation and bioresorption of the hydrogel for ReSure Sealant.

	Because intracanalicular depots stay in contact with the tear film, other companies have pursued the
	development of intracanalicular depots containing active drugs for sustained release to the ocular surface. However, these earlier depot designs had significant limitations with respect to drug capacity, drug release kinetics and patient comfort.
	The earlier depot designs used non-degradable depots with a clear silicone hard rubber shell containing only a core with active drug. These depots typically extended outside of the punctal opening and secured themselves in place with an external
	cap. The external cap was in constant contact with the surface of the eye, causing irritation and discomfort in some cases. In addition, some prior designs resorted to plugging both the upper and lower puncta, which could cause excessive tearing and

	Sustained delivery of drug

	. We have designed our intracanalicular depots to deliver drug in a sustained fashion to the surface of the eye in order to avoid the peak and valley dosing and related side effects and
	spikes in intraocular pressure associated with eye drops. We also believe sustained dosing may improve the therapeutic profile of the active pharmaceutical ingredient because it eliminates periods of little or no drug presence between eye drop
	administrations. Further, we are designing our product candidates so that their drug release profiles can be tailored to match the treatment needs of the disease. For example, steroids for ophthalmic purposes generally require administration over
	four weeks, with tapered dosing over this period. In contrast, prostaglandin analogs require administration in a steady fashion over the duration of treatment. Our intracanalicular depots are designed to fully dissipate over a period of two to three
	times the length of the expected period of release of the therapeutic agent and can be removed if necessary by a healthcare professional.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are engaged in preclinical development of an intravitreal depot to address the large and growing markets for diseases and conditions of the
	back of the eye. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our intravitreal depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs and small molecule TKIs for the treatment of back-of-the-eye diseases
	and conditions such as wet AMD. Our initial goal for this intravitreal depot is to provide sustained release of the drug over a four to six month period, thereby reducing the frequency of the current monthly or bi-monthly intravitreal injection
	regimen for wet AMD. We believe less frequent injections will be more convenient for patients and clinicians and may reduce the risk of infection and other potential side effects associated with each injection.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to seek to maximize the potential of this technology. We are collaborating on this program with
	several different pharmaceutical companies using protein-based anti-angiogenic agents and are also conducting our own internal development using the anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab. We are also conducting research efforts on the delivery of small
	molecule TKIs in our intravitreal depot and have been focusing this research on what we believe may be an optimal drug candidate.&nbsp;We believe this class of drugs is well suited for use with our platform given its high potency, multi-target
	capability, and compatibility with a hydrogel vehicle. In the absence of a sophisticated drug delivery system, these drugs have been difficult to deliver to the eye at therapeutic levels without causing local and systemic toxicity. We feel our local
	drug delivery technology gives us advantages in this regard. By selecting compounds that are compatible with our hydrogel platform technology and that will have expiration of relevant patents within the timeline of our development program, we would
	also avoid the need to license these molecules, thus retaining full worldwide rights to our products. We are advancing the preclinical development of the sustained delivery of a small molecule on our own in parallel with a protein-based
	anti-angiogenic drug delivery program, which would require the involvement of a collaboration partner.&nbsp;We plan to continue working with our pharmaceutical company partners on development efforts and exploring potential business development deal
	structures as well as advancing our internal development efforts on our sustained-release hydrogel depot for the treatment of back-of-the-eye diseases.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	ReSure Sealant is our bioresorbable hydrogel product for wound closure following cataract surgery. This product received marketing
	approval from the FDA in January 2014. We began the commercial launch of ReSure Sealant in February 2014 on a region-by-region basis in the United States through a network of independent distributors. A surgeon applies ReSure Sealant as a liquid
	painted onto the corneal incision. Within about 15 seconds, the sealant cross-links and transforms into a smooth, lubricious hydrogel that seals the wound. ReSure Sealant dissipates as healing progresses and does not require removal. In the pivotal
	clinical trials that formed the basis for FDA approval, ReSure Sealant provided superior wound closure and a better safety profile than sutured closure. However, we believe that the market opportunity for a surgical sealant following cataract
	surgery may be modest because sutures are used in only approximately 14% of cataract surgeries. We do not expect to generate meaningful levels of revenue from the sale of ReSure in 2016.

	Embedded within our DEXTENZA intracanalicular depot are dexamethasone drug particles that gradually erode and release the drug in a sustained
	fashion until the drug is depleted. As the dexamethasone drug particles erode and the hydrogel degrades by hydrolysis, the intracanalicular depot softens, liquefies and is cleared through the nasolacrimal duct. We provide the DEXTENZA drug product
	in a preservative-free formulation in a sterile, single use package.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The standard regimen for dexamethasone eye drops following cataract
	surgery is administration four to six times daily, with a gradual tapering in the number of eye drops over a four week period. Such a regimen is often confusing to patients as they must remember to taper the number of times per day they administer
	the steroid, while also taking multiple drops of other drugs, such as antibiotics and NSAIDs. We believe that sustained delivery of drug to the eye may result in better control of ocular inflammation and pain as compared to eye drops and that a low
	dose amount may provide enhanced safety by eliminating spikes in intraocular pressure associated with high dose steroid eye drops.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although dexamethasone is clinically effective in the treatment of late-phase inflammatory allergic reactions, the safety limitations
	associated with eye drop administration, including the potential to generate spikes in intraocular pressure due to the high levels of drug, have limited its widespread adoption as a treatment for this condition. These spikes in intraocular pressure
	can lead to drug-induced glaucoma, although the incidence is low. Further, use of oral anti-histamine medications as well as anti-histamine eye drops for allergic conjunctivitis may dry out the eye and exacerbate the discomfort to some patients. We
	believe, based on our clinical trial results to date, that periodic use of the DEXTENZA for allergic conjunctivitis will create a low, tapered, consistent dose of dexamethasone, potentially minimizing or eliminating side effects associated with the
	eye drop formulation, while retaining the drug&#146;s anti-inflammatory effects.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	One of the causes of dry eye disease is inflammation.
	Topical anti-inflammatory drugs are used as one of several therapies to treat dry eye disease and are administered by eye drops. As the understanding of dry eye disease, specifically the inflammatory components of dry eye disease, has evolved, the
	use of corticosteroids has become a standard to offer short-term relief of signs and symptoms of the disease. Physicians typically prescribe a topical corticosteroid for a period of two to four weeks, tapered over the course of delivery as the
	inflammation and symptoms subside. As with allergic conjunctivitis, there are safety limitations associated with the use of corticosteroids for inflammatory dry eye disease that have limited wide spread adoption. We believe that DEXTENZA has
	potential as a short-term therapy for more severe cases of dry eye caused by inflammation, followed by the delivery of an immunosuppressant drug such as cyclosporine after the inflammation has been reduced.

	In March and April 2015, we reported topline results from two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. In the first Phase 3 clinical trial, DEXTENZA met both primary
	efficacy endpoints, absence of pain at day 8 and absence of inflammatory cells at day 14, with statistical significance. In the second Phase 3 clinical trial, DEXTENZA met the primary efficacy endpoint for absence of pain at day 8 with statistical
	significance but did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint for absence of inflammatory cells at day 14. We met with the FDA in April 2015 to discuss the path forward for seeking marketing approval of DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical
	ocular inflammation and pain. In this pre-NDA clinical meeting, the FDA indicated that the existing data from our Phase 2 and two Phase 3 clinical trials are appropriate to support an NDA submission for DEXTENZA for a post-surgical ocular pain
	indication. The FDA further indicated that we would need additional data from a third Phase 3 clinical trial for the inflammation endpoint to support the potential labeling expansion of DEXTENZA&#146;s indications for use. We initiated a third Phase
	3 clinical trial for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain in October 2015. We submitted to the FDA an NDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. The FDA has accepted the NDA for filing and
	established a target action date under PDUFA of July&nbsp;24, 2016. Based on our expectations regarding initiation of our third Phase 3 clinical trial of DEXTENZA and our estimates regarding patient enrollment, we expect to have topline efficacy
	data available from this trial in the second half of 2016. If the results of our third Phase 3 clinical trial of DEXTENZA are favorable and subject to receiving approval for the pain indication pursuant to the initial NDA on the PDUFA action date,
	we plan to submit an NDA supplement for DEXTENZA for the treatment of
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	expect to commercially launch DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular pain in the United States in the first half of 2017. If we receive approval of the NDA supplement for post-surgical ocular inflammation, we would expect to expand the labeling to
	include this indication.

	In 2013, we completed a prospective, randomized, parallel-arm, vehicle-controlled, multicenter, double-masked Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating
	the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. We conducted this trial in 60 patients at four sites in the United States pursuant to an effective investigational new drug
	application, or IND. We randomized patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive either DEXTENZA or a placebo vehicle control intracanalicular depot without active drug. One patient randomized into the DEXTENZA group was excluded from the trial because the
	investigator was unable to insert the depot, resulting in 29 patients in the DEXTENZA group and 30 patients in the vehicle control group. We evaluated patients in this trial at days 1, 4, 8, 11, 14 and 30 following surgery.

	The two primary efficacy measures in this trial were absence of inflammatory cells in the
	anterior chamber of the study eye and absence of pain in the study eye. When viewed with a slit lamp biomicroscope, these inflammatory cells, referred to as cells in a slit lamp examination, appear like dust specks floating in a projected light
	beam. The presence of these cells in the anterior chamber indicates inflammation. In this trial, absence of pain was based on a patient reported score of zero on a scale from zero to ten of ocular pain assessment. The first primary efficacy endpoint
	was the difference in the proportion of patients in each treatment group with absence of cells in the anterior chamber of the study eye at day 8 following surgery. The second primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in the proportion of patients

	In this trial, DEXTENZA met the primary efficacy endpoint with statistical significance for absence of pain compared to the

	significance. The differences between DEXTENZA and the vehicle control for absence of pain also were statistically significant at each other evaluation date (p&lt;0.0002). These results are shown in the graph below. In this graph and other graphs

	Safety:
</B>
	In this trial, there were three serious adverse events, none of which was
	considered related to the study treatment. The trial investigator determined the relatedness of the serious adverse events to study treatment based on his or her professional medical judgment and in accordance with the study protocol, which required
	the investigator to determine that a reasonable possibility did not exist that the study treatment caused the adverse event. None of the three serious adverse events, syncope, intracranial hemorrhage and cellulitis of the arm, were ocular in nature.
	In addition, there were a variety of adverse events in both the DEXTENZA group and the vehicle control group, with the adverse events in the vehicle control group outnumbering the adverse events in the DEXTENZA group. In the DEXTENZA group, the only
	adverse event that occurred more than once was reduced visual acuity, which occurred twice. The most common adverse events in the vehicle control group were reduced visual acuity, conjunctival hyperemia and corneal edema. Overall, 19 adverse events
	were noted in the DEXTENZA group and 30 adverse events were noted in the vehicle control group. All adverse events were transient in nature and completely resolved by the end of the trial.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2014, we initiated a pivotal clinical trial program that consisted of two prospective, randomized, parallel-arm, vehicle-controlled,
	multicenter, double-masked Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. We initiated the first of these Phase 3 clinical trials in February 2014
	and the second trial in April 2014. Patient enrollment was completed in September 2014, and the topline efficacy data from these clinical trials was reported in March and April 2015. We initiated a third Phase 3 clinical trial in the October 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the first two trials, we enrolled an aggregate of 488 patients in these trials at 32 sites in the United States pursuant to our
	effective IND. We randomized patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive either DEXTENZA or a placebo vehicle control intracanalicular depot without active drug. We enrolled 247 patients at 16 sites in the first Phase 3 clinical trial. We enrolled 241
	patients at 16 sites in the second Phase 3 clinical trial. We evaluated patients at days 2, 4, 8, 14, 30 and 60 following surgery.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	two primary efficacy measures in these trials were absence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the study eye when measured with a slit lamp biomicroscope and absence of pain in the study eye. To meet the efficacy end point for absence
	of inflammatory cells, there needed to be a complete absence of inflammatory cells. In these trials, absence of pain was based on a patient reported score of zero on a scale from zero to ten of ocular pain assessment. The first primary efficacy
	endpoint for these trials was the difference in the proportion of patients in each treatment group with absence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the study eye at day 14 following surgery. Pivotal clinical trials for other ophthalmic
	steroid drugs approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States also have evaluated this endpoint at day 14. The second primary efficacy endpoint for these trials was the difference in the proportion of patients in each treatment group with
	absence of pain in the study eye at day 8 following surgery.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We evaluated as secondary efficacy measures the level of flare in the
	anterior chamber of the study eye at each evaluation date other than day 60 and absence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the study eye and absence of pain in the study eye at each evaluation date other than the day used for the
	primary efficacy measure and day 60. The secondary analyses on primary endpoints were intended to be exploratory assessments that can be used to support the results from the primary endpoints. If we obtain favorable results showing effectiveness of
	DEXTENZA at earlier time points for absence of cells or absence of pain, we will consider seeking to expand the labeling for DEXTENZA as part of our NDA following any marketing approval that we may receive. We enrolled patients in these two trials
	who were at least 18 years of age undergoing unilateral clear corneal cataract surgery. We excluded patients from these trials if, among other reasons, they have intraocular inflammation or ocular pain in the study eye at screening or have glaucoma
	or ocular hypertension.

	Efficacy:
</B>
	In the first Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, DEXTENZA met the primary efficacy
	endpoint with statistical significance for absence of cells in the anterior chamber compared to the vehicle control at day 14. 33.1% of DEXTENZA treated patients showed an absence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the study eye on day
	14 following drug product insertion, compared to 14.5% of those receiving placebo vehicle control intracanalicular depots (p=0.0018). DEXTENZA also met the primary efficacy endpoint with statistical significance for absence of pain compared to the
	vehicle control at day 8. 80.4% of patients receiving DEXTENZA reported absence of pain in the study eye on day 8 following insertion of the drug product, compared to 43.4% of those receiving placebo vehicle control intracanalicular depots (p&lt;
	0.0001).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the second Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, DEXTENZA met the primary efficacy endpoint for absence of pain at day 8 with
	statistical significance but did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint for absence of inflammatory cells at day 14. In the second Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, 77.5% of patients receiving DEXTENZA reported an absence of pain in the study eye on day
	8 following insertion of the drug product, compared to 58.8% of those receiving placebo vehicle control intracanalicular depots, a difference which was statistically significant (p=0.0025). However, 39.4% of DEXTENZA treated patients showed an
	absence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the study eye on day 14 following drug product insertion, compared to 31.3% of those receiving placebo vehicle control intracanalicular depots, a difference which was not statistically

	Safety:
</B>
	There were no ocular or treatment-related serious adverse events in the DEXTENZA
	treatment group in either of the two completed Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials. There was one ocular serious adverse event in the vehicle control group in the two completed Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials: hypopyon, or inflammatory cells in the anterior
	chamber. There were two patients with three serious adverse events in the DEXTENZA treatment group in the first Phase 3 clinical trial (1.2% incidence), compared with two patients with four serious adverse events in the vehicle control group (2.4%
	incidence). There were two serious adverse events in the DEXTENZA treatment group in the second Phase 3 clinical trial (1.3% incidence), compared with three serious adverse events in the vehicle control group (3.8% incidence). In the first
	Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, 98 adverse events were noted in the DEXTENZA group and 59 adverse events were noted in the vehicle control group. In the second Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, 74 adverse events were noted in the DEXTENZA group and 47
	adverse events were noted in the vehicle control group. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio between the treatment group and the vehicle control group. All adverse events were either resolved or considered chronic/stable at the time of subject
	exit from the study. We expect to be able to use the safety data from these Phase 3 trials to support our other DEXTENZA clinical development programs, including for allergic conjunctivitis.

	clinical trials of DEXTENZA based on our learnings from these prior trials. These modifications relate to factors we believe impacted the results of the second Phase 3 clinical trial, including the use of rescue medications in patients with mild
	inflammation at the day 8 visit and the use of high dose oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. In the third Phase 3 clinical trial, we will exclude patients receiving high doses of NSAIDs, such as Naproxen, and we have provided

	, which is a proprietary model owned by ORA, Inc., the clinical research organization we used to manage the trial. The modified CAC achieves a very high transient
	dose exposure by placing allergen directly into the space between the eyelid and the surface of the eye of the patient. We initially exposed patients to specified allergens to determine which allergens resulted in an allergic response for the
	patients. If patient was responsive to a particular allergen, we continued to expose the patient to that same allergen prior to each evaluation.

	Safety:
</B>
	In this trial, there was one serious adverse event in the treatment arm, which was
	depression. This event was suspected to be related to treatment. The trial investigator determined the relatedness of the serious adverse event to study treatment based on his or her professional medical judgment and in accordance with the study
	protocol, which required the investigator to determine that a reasonable possibility did not exist that the study treatment caused the adverse event. The serious adverse event was not ocular in nature. In addition, there were a variety of adverse
	events in both the DEXTENZA group and the vehicle control group, with nine ocular related adverse events and two non-ocular adverse events in the DEXTENZA group and eight ocular adverse events and two non-ocular adverse events in the vehicle control
	group. In the DEXTENZA group, the only adverse event that occurred more than once was reduction in visual acuity and increased intraocular pressure, both of which occurred twice. The most common adverse events in the vehicle control group were
	erythema of the eyelid, discharge from the eye and an increase in lacrimation, all of which occurred twice. All adverse events were transient in nature and completely resolved by the end of the trial.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We met with the FDA in December 2014 to review the Phase 2 clinical trial results of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and
	to discuss our planned Phase 3 clinical development program. Based on these discussions, we have initiated and completed one Phase 3 clinical trial and, in November 2015, initiated a second Phase 3 clinical trial for this indication. We expect to
	report topline results for the second Phase 3 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2016.

	First Phase 3 Clinical Trial
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We initiated the first of these two planned Phase 3 clinical trials in June 2015, and we reported topline efficacy results in October 2015.
	This first Phase 3 clinical trial was a prospective, randomized, parallel-arm, vehicle-controlled, multicenter, double-masked trial. A total of 73 patients were enrolled in this trial and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either DEXTENZA or
	a placebo vehicle control intracanalicular depot without active drug. This trial was conducted using the modified CAC model. We evaluated patients using three allergen challenges in series for each of two efficacy measures at days 7, 14 and 28
	following intracanalicular depot insertion as described below. In this Phase 3 clinical trial, we inserted the intracanalicular depots 48 to 72 hours after exposure to the allergen. In our completed Phase 2 clinical trial, we obtained better
	efficacy results with this design protocol as noted in the description of the Phase 2 efficacy results above.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The primary efficacy
	measures for this trial were ocular itching graded by the patient and conjunctival redness graded by the trial investigator, in each case based on a five point scale from zero to four. The primary efficacy endpoints were the differences between the
	treatment group and the vehicle group of at least 0.5 units on the five point scale measured on day 7 following insertion of the intracanalicular depot for all three time points measured for both ocular itching and conjunctival redness and
	differences of at least 1.0 unit for the majority of the three time points measured on day 7 following insertion of the intracanalicular depot for both ocular itching and conjunctival redness. The secondary endpoints were similar to the primary
	efficacy endpoints except that each variable was assessed at day 14 and day 28 following insertion of the intracanalicular depot. The primary efficacy measure of conjunctival redness is typically included in Phase 3 trials for allergic
	conjunctivitis but has not been required for FDA approval of drugs for allergic conjunctivitis. Most commercially available prescription medications for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis have an ocular itching indication only. As described
	below, ocular itching is the only primary efficacy endpoint in the second Phase 3 trial of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, with conjunctival redness being moved to a secondary efficacy endpoint.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We enrolled patients in this trial who were at least 18 years of age with a positive history of ocular allergies and a positive skin test
	reaction to a perennial allergen and a seasonal allergen. We excluded patients from this trial if, among other reasons, they had an active ocular infection or itching or conjunctival redness at screening.

	Efficacy:
</B>
	In this trial, there was a statistically significant mean difference
	(p&lt;0.0001) between the DEXTENZA treatment group and the placebo vehicle group for ocular itching at all three time points measured on day 7 post-insertion of the intracanalicular depot. DEXTENZA also met the primary efficacy endpoint for ocular
	itching. The DEXTENZA treatment group achieved a mean difference compared to the vehicle group of greater than 0.5 units on a five point scale on day 7 following insertion at each time point and greater than 1.0 unit at a majority of the time points
	on day 7 following insertion for ocular itching. There was a statistically significant mean difference (p=0.01 or less) between the DEXTENZA treatment group and the placebo vehicle group for conjunctival redness at all three time points measured on
	day 7 post-insertion of the intracanalicular depot. However, the DEXTENZA group did not achieve the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoints on day 7 post-insertion with respect to conjunctival redness. The secondary endpoints and complete safety
	data are being analyzed and are expected to be available in the second half of 2016.

	In this exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial, patients were selected for a minimum threshold of
	signs of corneal staining and were randomized to either treatment with DEXTENZA or a placebo vehicle depot. Patients were stratified into groups based on the level of National Eye Institute aggregate corneal fluorescein staining score improvement
	and were then randomized into the treatment or placebo vehicle depot group per a pre-determined randomization list to maintain masking. DEXTENZA treated patients showed clinically meaningful benefits compared to patients receiving a placebo vehicle
	control intracanalicular depot, with improvement in total and inferior corneal staining as well as conjunctival staining. Total corneal staining at day 30 following randomization was significantly decreased from baseline in the DEXTENZA group
	(-3.14) compared to placebo (-1.10) (p=0.018). Inferior staining showed clinically significant differences in the change from baseline in the DEXTENZA treatment group compared to the placebo group (-0.44 and -0.45 at day 15 and day 30,
	respectively). Corneal staining is a primary endpoint that has been used in recent Phase 3 dry eye clinical trials for dry eye disease conducted by other ophthalmology companies. Supportive analyses of lissamine green staining also demonstrated a

	In May 2014, we completed a prospective, randomized, multi-arm, active-controlled, multicenter, double masked Phase 2 clinical
	trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of two versions of OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The OTX-TPa version was intended to release travoprost over a two-month period, and the OTX-TPb version was intended to release
	travoprost at a slower rate over a three-month period. Based on
<I>
	in vitro

	testing, the OTX-TPa version had an average daily drug delivery rate of 3.5&nbsp;micrograms&nbsp;per day and the OTX-TPb version had an average daily drug delivery rate
	of 2.8&nbsp;micrograms&nbsp;per day. We conducted this trial in 41 patients at four sites in South Africa. In this trial, we randomized 11 patients for treatment with OTX-TPa and placebo eye drops, 17&nbsp;patients for treatment with OTX-TPb and
	placebo eye drops and 13&nbsp;patients for treatment with a placebo vehicle control intracanalicular depot without active drug and timolol eye drops. One patient randomized into the timolol group was excluded from the trial because the investigator
	was unable to insert the depot. We randomized more patients in the OTX-TPb group than in the OTX-TPa group because we ceased enrolling patients in the OTX-TPa group during the trial based on an amendment to our trial protocol intended to facilitate
	the completion of the trial and to allow us to evaluate a larger number of patients being treated with a three-month version of the depot. Timolol is the most commonly prescribed non-PGA drug for the treatment of glaucoma and has been used as a
	comparator drug in pivotal clinical trials for other approval glaucoma products.

	The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial was the difference between treatment groups in the mean change in intraocular pressure
	from baseline at day 60 following insertion of the intracanalicular depot, calculated by averaging the change from baseline across the three time points at the assessment date, which is known as diurnal intraocular pressure. The secondary efficacy
	endpoints in this trial were the difference between treatment groups in the mean change from baseline in average diurnal intraocular pressure at day 90, the difference between treatment groups in the mean change from baseline in intraocular pressure
	at each individual time point at day 60 and day 90, the difference between treatment groups in the mean change in average diurnal intraocular pressure and intraocular pressure at each individual time point at day 60 and day 90, and the difference

	This Phase 2b glaucoma clinical trial was designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of OTX-TP compared to timolol and to inform the further
	clinical development for OTX-TP. This trial was not powered to show statistical significance between treatment groups. The OTX-TP treatment group included placebo eye drops that may have reduced the efficacy measures for OTX-TP, by washing out drug
	eluted from the depot from the ocular surface, whereas the timolol group included a placebo depot that may have improved the efficacy of timolol. Through occlusion of the punctum thereby prolonging its retention on the ocular surface. Several
	peer-reviewed medical journals have reported studies in which an additional intraocular pressure lowering effect of 1.32 to 1.80 mmHg was observed in patients taking timolol eye drops in combination with a non-drug eluting punctum plug compared to
	those patients only taking timolol eye drops. These include studies reported in September 2011 in

	mmHg at day 30 and 5.4 mmHg at day 60 in this trial. We believe that the higher intraocular pressure reduction observed in this trial may be due to the lack of placebo eye drops.

	We performed additional post-hoc analyses that were not pre-specified in the trial protocol for the Phase 2b glaucoma clinical trial to

	OTX-TP product candidate and are helpful in determining the study population and inclusion and exclusion criteria for future clinical trials. When we excluded patients on more than one glaucoma medication and used the baseline of five weeks of
	washout for comparisons of the OTX-TP group and the timolol group, the differences in mean reduction in intraocular pressure between the OTX-TP treatment group and the timolol group at the 8:00 a.m. time point on day 30, 60 and 90 narrowed to an
	average of 1.1 mmHg from an average of 2.2 mmHg based on the pre-specified criteria. These results are shown in the table below:

	We conduct medical device NSR IDE studies on an ongoing basis for the purpose of refining our intracanalicular depot product and placement

	In a series of completed NSR studies, we have effected compositional and dimensional adjustments to our intracanalicular depot to optimize

	ReSure Sealant is a topical liquid hydrogel that creates a temporary, adherent, soft and lubricious sealant to prevent post-surgical
	leakage from clear corneal incisions that are made during cataract surgery. The main components of ReSure hydrogel are water and PEG. ReSure hydrogel is completely synthetic, with no animal or human derived components. The FDA granted marketing
	approval for ReSure Sealant in January 2014. We commercially launched ReSure Sealant in the United States in February 2014 through a network of ophthalmology focused distributors.

	We previously commercialized in Europe an earlier version of ReSure Sealant that was approved and marketed as an ocular bandage. However, we
	ceased our commercialization of the product in 2012 to focus on the ongoing clinical development of ReSure Sealant pursuant to FDA requirements after the FDA requested that we withdraw an application for the earlier version of ReSure Sealant that we
	had submitted under Section&nbsp;510(k) of the FDCA because the FDA believed that the technical characteristics of the earlier version of ReSure Sealant were not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. After withdrawing our 510(k)
	application, we filed an IDE application to conduct a pivotal clinical trial to support approval of ReSure Sealant as an ocular sealant and subsequently received premarket approval, or PMA, from the FDA.

	A
	surgeon forms ReSure Sealant hydrogel by combining three components: PEG, a cross-linker and a diluent buffer solution. The cross-linker interacts with the PEG molecules to form a molecular network that comprises the hydrogel. The components are
	mixed to initiate the cross-linking reaction to form a biocompatible, resorbable hydrogel. The hydrogel is approximately 90% water and is blue in color to help the surgeon visualize the sealant during application. The surgeon applies the sealant to
	the corneal incision as a liquid using a soft foam-tipped applicator. The sealant forms a conformal coating that adheres to the ocular tissue through mechanical interlocking of the hydrogel with the tissue surfaces. The blue color fades within a few
	hours following surgery. The soft, pliable hydrogel remains on the corneal surface during the critical wound healing period of one to three days and provides a barrier to fluid leakage. ReSure Sealant softens over time, detaches and is sloughed off
	in the tears as a liquid or extremely soft gel pieces. ReSure Sealant is designed to completely liquefy over a five to seven day duration. Complete epithelial healing takes place over this time period, providing long-term wound closure.

	ReSure Sealant. As a result, we randomized 304 patients for treatment with ReSure Sealant and 183 patients for treatment with sutures. Based on the trial protocol, 295 patients treated with ReSure Sealant and 176 patients treated with sutures

	The primary efficacy endpoint was non-inferiority of ReSure Sealant to sutures for preventing

	The surgeon slowly applied force using the standardized tool that we provided until a leak was observed or until a pre-specified maximum force of one ounce of force was reached. In the assessments conducted during the operation, approximately 50% of
	leaks occurred spontaneously without application of force and 76% of leaks occurred with the application of 0.25 ounces of force or less.

	of our NDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain on the PDUFA action date, we expect to commercially launch this product in the U.S. in the first half of 2017. If the results of our third Phase 3 clinical trial of DEXTENZA for
	the treatment of post-surgical inflammation and pain are favorable, we expect to submit an sNDA in order to get label expansion for post-surgical inflammation. Within the United States, we plan to initially use a contract sales organization, or CSO,
	to hire and deploy a sales force dedicated to selling DEXTENZA and to hire our own sales management team. We may also supplement the CSO sales force with a co-promotional arrangement with another ophthalmology company with an existing sales force.
	Over time, we may elect to selectively convert CSO sales representatives to direct employees. If OTX-TP is approved for marketing, we may use a combination of CSO and direct sales representatives, and potentially expand the size of the team, to
	commercialize OTX-TP as well. We expect that we will collaborate with a pharmaceutical company for the commercialization of our intravitreal depot for the delivery of anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of back-of-the-eye diseases, including wet AMD,
	if approved for marketing. Alternatively, we may elect to pursue the internal development of an intravitreal depot and commercialization of this product with a direct sales force calling on retinal specialists.

	Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in
	accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written
	study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any
	subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical
	trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical
	trials to commence. For our intracanalicular depot product candidates, we have typically conducted our initial and earlier stage clinical trials outside the United States. We generally plan to conduct our later stage and pivotal clinical trials of
	our intracanalicular depot product candidates in the United States. To date, we have submitted two INDs to the FDA. The first IND was submitted in August 2012 and relates to DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain
	and, pursuant to subsequent amendments submitted in February and November 2014, allergic conjunctivitis and inflammatory dry eye disease. We submitted a second IND to the FDA relating to OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension
	in the second half of 2014 prior to initiating our Phase 2b clinical trial of OTX-TP for this indication.

	allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#146;s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to
	show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application &#147;were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or

	Thus, Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and

	approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA&#146;s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product.

	NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies that must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the

	controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an
	application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment. These fees are
	typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses and an exception from the

	The FDA conducts a
	preliminary review of an NDA within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA&#146;s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The
	FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for

	of applications for NMEs that have been designated for &#147;priority review&#148; are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review

	Accelerated Approval Pathway
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to
	patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product
	has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other
	clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness
	as those granted traditional approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory
	measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical
	endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals
	based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if
	there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate
	clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug&#146;s clinical
	benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint.
	Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved
	under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

	resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA

	the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease,

	the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and

	In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities

	cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are
	the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a
	generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the
	active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is &#147;bioequivalent&#148; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug
	is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#147;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is &#147;therapeutically equivalent&#148; to the RLD in its
	publication &#147;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#148; also referred to as the &#147;Orange Book.&#148; Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the
	RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#146;s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the
	prescribing physician or patient.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of
	non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been
	approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA
	until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period
	of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the
	application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.

	the time between the submission date of a NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. Only one patent applicable
	to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be

	documents meant to expedite review of a 510(k) and facilitate interactions between applicants and the agency. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, a manufacturer must show that the device has the same intended use as a predicate device and the
	same technological characteristics, or the same intended use and different technological characteristics and does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device.

	The FDA seeks to review and act on a 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer if the agency finds that it requires more
	information to review the 510(k). If the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the subject device may be marketed. However, if the FDA concludes that a new device is not substantially equivalent to a
	predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III and the manufacturer will be required to submit a PMA application to market the product. Devices of a new type that the FDA has not previously classified based on risk are
	automatically classified into Class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FDCA, regardless of the level of risk they pose. To avoid requiring PMA review of low- to moderate-risk devices classified in Class III by operation of law, Congress
	enacted section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA. This provision allows the FDA to classify a low- to moderate-risk device not previously classified into Class I or II, a process known as the

	The PMA application process for approval to market a medical device is more complex, costly, and time- consuming than the 510(k) clearance
	procedure. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and controls information and labeling information that
	demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the PMA application is
	complete, the FDA will file the PMA application. If the FDA accepts the application for filing, the agency will begin an in-depth substantive review of the application. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the application although, generally,
	review of the application often takes between one and three years, and may take significantly longer. If the FDA has questions, it will likely issue a first major deficiency letter within 150 days of filing. It may also refer the PMA application to
	an FDA advisory panel for additional review, and will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, either of which could extend the 180-day response target. In addition, the FDA may request
	additional information or request the performance of additional clinical trials in which case the PMA application approval may be delayed while the trials are conducted and the data acquired are submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Even with
	additional trials, the FDA may not approve the PMA application.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the FDA&#146;s evaluations of both the PMA application and the
	manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing or an approvable letter that usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval. If the
	FDA&#146;s evaluations are not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA application or issue a not approvable letter. The PMA application process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by
	the FDA, can take several years, and the process can be expensive and uncertain. Moreover, even if the FDA approves a PMA application, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought. The FDA
	can impose post-approval conditions that it believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. After approval of a PMA application, a
	new PMA application or PMA application supplement may be required for a modification to the device, its labeling, or its manufacturing process. PMA application supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA
	application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an
	advisory panel. The time for review of a PMA application supplement may vary depending on the type of change, but it can be lengthy. In addition, in some cases the FDA might require additional clinical data.

	are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation

	An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the

	receipt, that the IDE is approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of subjects to be enrolled at specified study centers. The clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with
	applicable regulations, including but not limited to the FDA&#146;s IDE regulations and GCP. The investigators must obtain subject informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of

	product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA Center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address
	issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance
	and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.

	The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating, among other things, the design, manufacture, clinical trials,
	labeling, approval and adverse event reporting for medical devices. In the EU, medical devices must comply with the Essential Requirements in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC), or the Essential Requirements.
	Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE Mark of Conformity to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the European Economic Area, or EEA, comprised of the European Union member states
	plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. Actual implementation of these directives, however, may vary on a country-by-country basis.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To
	demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements a manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices, where the
	manufacturer can issue a CE Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a third-party organization designated
	by competent authorities of a European Union country to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are independent testing houses, laboratories, or product certifiers typically based within the European Union and authorized
	by the European member states to perform the required conformity assessment tasks, such as quality system audits and device compliance testing. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine the product&#146;s Technical File and the quality
	system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the product before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Medical device manufacturers must carry out a clinical evaluation of their medical devices to demonstrate conformity with the relevant
	Essential Requirements. This clinical evaluation is part of the product&#146;s Technical File. A clinical evaluation includes an assessment of whether a medical device&#146;s performance is in accordance with its intended use, and that the known and
	foreseeable risks linked to the use of the device under normal conditions are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended purpose. The clinical evaluation conducted by the manufacturer must also address any clinical
	claims, the adequacy of the device labeling and information (particularly claims, contraindications, precautions and warnings) and the suitability of related Instructions for Use. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained
	from clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or both clinical studies and scientific literature.

	Additionally, all
	manufacturers placing medical devices in the market in the European Union are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident
	occurred. In the European Union, manufacturers must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the European Union countries, and manufacturers are required to take
	Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or
	deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other
	persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its European Authorized
	Representative to its customers and to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. In September 2012, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation which, if adopted, will change the way that most medical devices are

	in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of
	generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.

	In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive
	pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a
	product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.

	Section 1833(t)(6) of the Social Security Act provides for temporary additional payments or &#147;transitional pass-through payments&#148; for
	certain drugs and biological agents. As originally enacted by the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, this provision required Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, to make additional payments to hospitals for current orphan
	drugs, as designated under section 526 of the FDCA; current drugs and biological agents and brachytherapy sources used for the treatment of cancer; and current radiopharmaceutical drugs and biological products. Transitional pass-through payments are
	also provided for certain new drugs, devices and biological agents that were not paid for as a hospital outpatient department service as of December 31, 1996, and whose cost is &#147;not insignificant&#148; in relation to the Outpatient Prospective
	Payment System payment for the procedures or services associated with the new drug, device, or biological. Under the statute, transitional pass-through payments can be made for at least two years but not more than three years.

	CMS for a standard J&nbsp;code for our other DEXTENZA product candidates, including allergic conjunctivitis, as well as for our OTX-TP product candidate, if our clinical trials are successful and if our NDA filings and NDA supplements are approved

	In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that
	drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies.
	For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
	European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow
	companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are
	being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement
	limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

	Since inception, we have incurred significant operating
	losses. Our net losses were $13.3 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, $28.7 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and $39.7 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an
	accumulated deficit of $129.2 million. Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock and borrowings under credit facilities. In
	June&nbsp;2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock, which resulted in the sale of 4,600,000 shares consisting of 3,200,000 shares being sold by us and 1,400,000 shares being sold by certain stockholders of the Company, including
	those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and
	offering costs. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant, which was approved in January 2014 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to seal clear corneal incisions following cataract surgery.
	We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials and, beginning in the first quarter of 2014, commercialization of ReSure Sealant. We expect to
	continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.

	two completed Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA at day 14. In the first of these two Phase 3 clinical trials, DEXTENZA met both primary endpoints for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery with statistical significance. However,

	According to the trial protocols, the two primary efficacy endpoints in our completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials
	are fixed sequence endpoints. As such, a statistical analysis of the trial results required that we first assess the primary endpoint regarding absence of inflammatory cells in the study eye. The protocol and statistical analysis plan for the trial
	did not contemplate assessing the primary endpoint regarding absence of pain in the study eye in the event the clinical trial of DEXTENZA did not meet the first primary endpoint with statistical significance. The FDA has informed us that the
	hierarchy of the two primary endpoints for inflammation and pain is applicable in connection with their review of our NDA seeking approval for DEXTENZA for an ocular pain indication. However, the FDA has also informed us that pain endpoints from the
	Phase 2 and two Phase 3 trials, with respect to which we received favorable data, would support the NDA submission. Therefore, in September 2015, we submitted to the FDA an NDA for DEXTENZA for an ocular pain indication using the existing data from

	We designed our Phase 2 clinical trials of OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension to assess clinically meaningful
	response to treatment, and did not power these trials to measure any efficacy endpoints with statistical significance. We reported topline efficacy results from our Phase 2b clinical trial of OTX-TP for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular
	hypertension in October 2015. In this trial, on day&nbsp;60 at the 8:00&nbsp;a.m. time point, the OTX-TP group experienced a mean intraocular pressure lowering effect of 4.7&nbsp;mmHg, compared with intraocular pressure lowering of 6.4 mmHg for the
	timolol arm. On day&nbsp;90 at the 8:00&nbsp;a.m. time point, the OTX-TP group experienced an intraocular pressure lowering effect of 5.2 mmHg, compared with an intraocular pressure lowering effect of 7.3 mmHg in the timolol arm. We plan to conduct
	additional non-significant risk studies on additional modified depot designs, discuss alternative Phase 3 clinical trial designs with advisors and with the FDA and formulate our plans for our Phase 3 program. In particular, in our meeting with the
	FDA, the FDA could provide additional or different guidance or information at that time which might impact our Phase 3 program. We currently expect that there will be a delay of approximately six&nbsp;months in initiating Phase 3 trials of OTX-TP

	The success of our intracanalicular depot product candidates is dependent upon retention
	following insertion and during the course of intended therapy. As such, we continue to conduct non-significant risk, or NSR, studies in the United States for our sustained-release intracanalicular depots in an effort to increase the rate of
	retention. All NSR studies that we have performed to date have involved placebo vehicle control intracanalicular depots without active drug. If we determine to make any future changes to the design or composition of our depots, such changes could
	affect the outcome of any subsequent clinical trials using these updated depots. For example, in our Phase 2b clinical trial of OTX-TP, we are using a different version of intracanalicular depot than either of the depots that we used in our Phase 2a
	clinical trial of OTX-TP. Based on the results of our completed Phase 2a clinical trial, we designed the OTX-TP depot that was used in our Phase 2b clinical trial to deliver drug over a 90 day period at the same daily rate as the two-month version
	of the depot used in the Phase 2a clinical trial. To achieve this, we modified the design of the OTX-TP depot to enlarge it in order to enable the depot to carry a greater amount of drug. In addition, we incorporated minor structural changes to
	improve retention rates. In our Phase 2b clinical trial depots were found to be retained in 91% of patients at day 60, 88% of patients at day 75 and 48% of patients at day 90, reflecting the corresponding absorption and clearance of the depots with
	the duration of drug release. We plan to conduct additional non-significant risk studies on additional modified depot designs as we design our Phase 3 trials for OTX-TP. If in our Phase 3 clinical trials the retention rates for our depots are
	inadequate to ensure that the patient is receiving appropriate therapy, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals or, even if approved, achieve market acceptance of our sustained-release drug delivery products.

	The protocols for our clinical trials and other supporting information are subject to review by
	the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States. For our intracanalicular depot product candidates, we have typically conducted our initial and earlier stage clinical trials outside the United States. We generally plan to conduct our
	later stage and pivotal clinical trials of our intracanalicular depot product candidates in the United States. The FDA, however, could require us to conduct additional studies or require us to modify our planned pivotal clinical trials to receive
	clearance to initiate such trials in the United States or to continue such trials once initiated. For example, in connection with our initial development of ReSure Sealant, in June 2010 the FDA requested that we withdraw an application that we had
	submitted under Section&nbsp;510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for the marketing of an earlier version of ReSure Sealant as an ocular bandage because the FDA believed that the technical characteristics of the earlier version of
	ReSure Sealant were not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. In particular, unlike predicate devices that could be removed if there is discomfort, our product candidate adhered to the corneal surface and was not easily removable by the
	patient. As a result of this determination by the FDA, we needed to pursue a different regulatory approval pathway and conduct additional clinical development of our product candidate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. After withdrawing our
	510(k) application, we filed an investigational device exemption application to conduct a pivotal clinical trial to support approval of ReSure Sealant as an ocular sealant. The results of this pivotal trial ultimately supported the marketing
	approval of ReSure Sealant in January 2014, although not in the time frame we had initially expected. The FDA is not obligated to comment on our trial protocols within any specified time period or at all or to affirmatively clear or approve our
	planned pivotal clinical trials. Subject to a waiting period of 30&nbsp;days, we could choose to initiate our pivotal clinical trials in the United States without waiting for any additional period for comments from the FDA.

	Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions

	data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on
	its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials,

	In addition, in February 2016, as part of the ongoing review of our NDA for DEXTENZA, the FDA conducted a pre-NDA approval inspection of our manufacturing operations. As a result of this inspection, we received an FDA Form 483 containing
	inspectional observations focused on process controls, analytical testing and physical security procedures related to manufacture of our drug product for stability and commercial production purposes. We addressed some observations before the
	inspection was closed and have responded to the FDA with a corrective action plan to complete the inspection process. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities at any time also may implement new standards, or change their interpretation and

	Our assessment of the potential market opportunity for ReSure Sealant and our product candidates

	We have limited experience in the sale,
	marketing and distribution of drug and device products. To achieve commercial success for ReSure Sealant and any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and
	distribution capabilities, either ourselves or through collaborations or other arrangements with third parties. We sell ReSure Sealant through a network of independent medical device distributors across the United States. We may determine to build a
	direct sales force to sell DEXTENZA, if approved for marketing and may initially use a contract sales organization to staff a dedicated team of sales representatives. We may also consider co-promotional arrangements with larger ophtholmology
	companies. We expect that a direct sales force will be required to effectively market and sell OTX-TP, if approved for marketing. Because we do not plan to determine whether to seek regulatory approval for any of our product candidates outside of
	the United States until after we receive regulatory approval for the applicable product candidate in the United States, at this time we cannot be certain when, if ever, we will recognize revenue from commercialization of our product candidates in
	any international markets. If we decide to commercialize our products outside of the United States, we expect to utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to
	commercialize any product of ours that receives marketing approval. These may include independent distributors, pharmaceutical companies or our own direct sales organization.

	There are risks involved with both establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and with entering into arrangements

	have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to market, sell and distribute our products effectively. Our product revenues and our profitability, if any, under third-party
	collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements may also be lower than if we were to sell, market and distribute a product ourselves. On the other hand, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could
	delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of any product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred
	these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.

	Our product candidates target markets that are already
	served by a variety of competing products based on a number of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Many of these existing products have achieved widespread acceptance among physicians, patients and payors for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases and
	conditions. In addition, many of these products are available on a generic basis, and our product candidates may not demonstrate sufficient additional clinical benefits to physicians, patients or payors to justify a higher price compared to generic
	products. In many cases, insurers or other third-party payors, particularly Medicare, seek to encourage the use of generic products. Given that we are developing products based on FDA-approved therapeutic agents, our product candidates, if approved,
	will face competition from generic and branded versions of existing drugs based on the same active pharmaceutical ingredients that are administered in a different manner, typically through eye drops.

	Because the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our product candidates are available on a generic basis, or are soon to be available on a
	generic basis, competitors will be able to offer and sell products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products so long as these competitors do not infringe the patents that we license. For example, our licensed patents related to
	our intracanalicular depot product candidates largely relate to the hydrogel composition of the intracanalicular depots and certain drug-release features of the depots. As such, if a third party were able to design around the formulation and process
	patents that we license and create a different formulation using a different production process not covered by our licensed patents or patent applications, we would likely be unable to prevent that third party from manufacturing and marketing its

	Our ability to commercialize
	ReSure Sealant or any product candidates that we may develop successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government healthcare
	programs, private health insurers, managed care plans and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and
	establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for
	particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug and device companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement
	may not be available for ReSure Sealant or any other product that we commercialize and, even if they are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Inadequate reimbursement may adversely affect the demand for, or the price of, ReSure Sealant or any product candidate for which we obtain
	marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to
	other therapies. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ReSure Sealant or any product candidates for which we obtain marketing
	approval.

	There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and devices, and coverage may
	be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases
	or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent.
	Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net
	prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at
	lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from
	both government-funded and private payors for any FDA-approved products that we develop would compromise our ability to generate revenues and become profitable.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug and device products vary widely from country
	to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it
	can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after
	initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time

	Our success depends in large part on our and our licensor&#146;s ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and
	other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We and our licensor have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product
	candidates. Some of our licensed patents that we believe are integral to our hydrogel technology platform have terms that extend through at least 2024. However, other broader patents within our licensed patent portfolio expire between 2017 and 2019.
	Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our licensed
	patent portfolio would be less effective in excluding others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not have filed or prosecuted and may not be able to

	In some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent
	applications, or to enforce or maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. In particular, the license agreement that we have entered into with Incept, LLC, or Incept, an intellectual property holding company, which
	covers all of the patent rights and a significant portion of the technology for ReSure Sealant and our product candidates, provides that, with limited exceptions, Incept has sole control and responsibility for ongoing prosecution for the patents
	covered by the license agreement. In addition, although we have a right under the Incept license to bring suit against third parties who infringe our licensed patents in our field, other Incept licensees may also have the right to enforce our
	licensed patents in their own respective fields without our oversight or control. Those other licensees may choose to enforce our licensed patents in a way that harms our interest, for example, by advocating for claim interpretations or agreeing on
	invalidity positions that conflict with our positions or our interest. For example, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, or Integra, another licensee of Incept, has filed suit against HyperBranch Medical Technology, Inc. alleging infringement
	of several patents which we also license. This litigation could result in one or more of the patents which both we and Integra license being invalidated or rendered unenforceable. We also have no right to control the defense of any of our licensed
	patents if their validity or scope is challenged before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, European Patent Office, or other patent office or tribunal. Instead, we would essentially rely on our licensor to defend such challenges, and it

	The patent
	position of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope,
	validity, enforceability and commercial value of our licensor&#146;s patent rights are highly uncertain. Our licensor&#146;s pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or
	which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, unlike patent law in
	the United States, European patent law precludes the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body and imposes substantial restrictions on the scope of claims it will grant if broader than specifically disclosed embodiments. Moreover, we
	have no patent protection and likely will never obtain patent protection for ReSure Sealant outside the United States and Canada. We have only two issued patents outside of the United States for two of our three intracanalicular depot product
	candidates, and these expire by 2019. We have three licensed patent families in Europe and certain other parts of the world, but these families consist only of patent applications outside of the United States and have no issued or allowed patents.

	Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States
	and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18&nbsp;months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensor were the first to make the inventions claimed in our licensed
	patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Databases for patents and publications, and methods for searching them, are inherently limited so it is not
	practical to review and know the full scope of all issued and pending patent applications. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our licensed patent rights are uncertain. Our pending and future patent
	applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of
	any patent application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our ability to generate additional preclinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our proposed claims. We may not be able to generate
	sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our

	Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent
	applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent
	applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the
	Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. The first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor to patent an invention if not the first to file an application for patenting
	that invention, even if such invention was the first invention. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the
	uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For example, the Leahy-Smith Act provides a new administrative tribunal known as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board,
	or PTAB, that provides a venue for companies to challenge the validity of competitor patents at a cost that is much lower than district court litigation and on timelines that are much faster. Although it is not clear what, if any, long term impact
	the PTAB proceedings will have on the operation of our business, the initial results of patent challenge proceedings before the PTAB since its inception in 2013 have resulted in the

	Sealant. The first post-approval study, identified as the Clinical PAS, is to confirm that ReSure Sealant can be used safely by physicians in a standard cataract surgery practice and to confirm the incidence of the most prevalent adverse ocular

	initiated enrollment in December 2014. We anticipate completing the Clinical PAS in two to three years. The second post-approval study, identified as the Device Exposure Registry, is intended to
	link to the Medicare database to ascertain if patients are diagnosed or treated for endophthalmitis within 30 days following cataract surgery and application of ReSure Sealant. Following review of the data from these studies, any concerns raised by
	the FDA could lead to modifications in product labeling, the approved indication for use or negative publicity impacting our commercialization efforts. In addition, in order to use the Medicare database in the Device Exposure Registry, we will need
	to obtain a Medicare tracking or research code for ReSure Sealant. In December 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, denied our application for a tracking or research code for ReSure Sealant commercial use. While we are
	pursuing other options for conducting this registry study, we may not be able to complete the Device Exposure Registry without a tracking or research code. We are required to provide periodic reports to the FDA on the progress of each post-approval
	study until it is completed. Based on results of the post-approval studies, or if we are unable to complete the Device Exposure Registry, the FDA, among other things, could modify the product labeling with respect to ReSure Sealant to the extent the
	FDA has any concerns with respect to endophthalmitis that we are unable to address due to the lack of completion of the study. This would negatively affect our ability to commercialize ReSure Sealant.

	If we expand our

	to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and

	Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the
	FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in
	connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.

	share for an aggregate public offering price of $65.0 million. In August 2014, the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares of our common stock. The over-allotment shares had an aggregate
	public offering price of $9.75 million. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-196932), which was declared effective by the
	SEC on July&nbsp;24, 2014.

	million of the net proceeds from the offering as follows: $33.8 million for research and development costs, $4.6 million for sales and marketing costs, $11.6 million for general and administrative purposes, $3.6 million for capital spending, and
	$1.7 million to pay interest expense. We have not used any of the net proceeds from the offering to make payments, directly or indirectly, to any director or officer of ours or any of their associates, to any person owning 10 percent or more of our
	common stock, or to any affiliate of ours. We have invested the remaining net proceeds from the offering in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and money market funds
	backed by U.S. government securities. There has been no material change in our planned use of the net proceeds from the offering as described in our final prospectus dated as of July&nbsp;24, 2014 filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a biopharmaceutical
	company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using our proprietary hydrogel platform technology. Our bioresorbable hydrogel-based product candidates are designed to provide
	sustained delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye. Our lead product candidates are DEXTENZA and OTX-TP , sustained-release, drug-eluting intracanalicular depots that are inserted into the canaliculus through a natural opening called the punctum
	located in the inner portion of the eyelid near the nose. Our intracanalicular depots combine our hydrogel technology with U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved therapeutic agents with the goal of providing sustained delivery of drug
	to the eye. We also have an intravitreal hydrogel depot which is in preclinical development for the treatment of diseases and conditions of the back of the eye including wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. Our intravitreal depot is
	designed to be delivered via intravitreal injection to release therapeutic agents, such as antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, over a sustained period. In addition to our ongoing product development, we have launched our first
	commercial product, ReSure Sealant, a hydrogel-based ophthalmic wound sealant approved by the FDA in January 2014 to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery. ReSure Sealant is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA
	for ophthalmic use.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our most advanced product candidate, DEXTENZA, incorporates the FDA-approved corticosteroid dexamethasone as an
	active pharmaceutical ingredient into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting intracanalicular depot. DEXTENZA is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain, and, in September 2015, we submitted to the FDA
	a New Drug Application, or NDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. The FDA has accepted the NDA for filing. We have completed two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. The
	data from these two completed Phase 3 clinical trials and a prior Phase 2 clinical trial are being used to support our NDA for post-surgical ocular pain. In October 2015, we initiated a third Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of post-surgical
	ocular inflammation and pain. We expect to have topline efficacy data available from this third trial in the second half of 2016. If the results this third trial are favorable and subject to receiving approval for the pain indication pursuant to the
	initial NDA, we plan to submit an NDA supplement for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation. DEXTENZA is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. In October 2015, we announced
	topline results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis. We initiated enrollment of our second Phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis in November 2015. Finally, DEXTENZA is in Phase 2 clinical development for the
	treatment of inflammatory dry eye disease. We announced topline results from an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial for this indication in December 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our second product candidate, OTX-TP, incorporates travoprost, an FDA-approved prostaglandin analog that reduces elevated intraocular
	pressure, as its active pharmaceutical ingredient into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting intracanalicular depot. OTX-TP is in Phase 2 clinical development for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We reported topline results from a Phase 2b clinical trial
	for this indication in October 2015. We expect to have an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2016 and initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of OTX-TP in the third quarter of 2016.

	In addition to DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, we are engaged in the preclinical development of our
	intravitreal depot administered via intravitreal injection to address the large and growing markets for diseases and conditions of the back of the eye. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our sustained-release hydrogel depot in
	combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, for the treatment of wet age related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. Our initial
	goal for this program is to provide sustained release of an anti-angiogenic protein or a TKI drug over a four to six month period following administration of a bioresorbable hydrogel incorporating the drug by an injection into the vitreous humor,
	thereby reducing the frequency of the current monthly or bi-monthly intravitreal injection regimen for wet AMD and other back-of-the-eye diseases. We also have a pipeline of earlier stage intracanalicular depot product candidates, including OTX-MP,
	which has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics in patients following cataract surgery.

	Following our
	receipt of FDA approval for ReSure Sealant, we commercially launched this product in the United States in 2014 through a network of ophthalmology focused distributors. ReSure Sealant is approved to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery
	and is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use. In the pivotal clinical trials that formed the basis for FDA approval, ReSure Sealant provided superior wound closure and a better safety profile than sutured
	closure.

	We have generated limited revenue to date. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from sales of ReSure
	Sealant. All of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability. Instead, our ability
	to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and OTX-TP. Since inception, we
	have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $39.7 million, $28.6 million and $13.3 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of
	$129.2 million.

	Our total operating expenses were $39.9 million, $27.9 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
	2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, including $4.6 million, $5.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and licensing and consulting fees paid in stock. We anticipate that our operating expenses will
	increase substantially as we pursue the clinical development of our most advanced product candidates, DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, continue the research and development of our other product candidates, continue the internal development of our intravitreal
	hydrogel depot for the sustained delivery of protein-based or small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs, such as anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and other back-of-the-eye diseases and seek marketing approval for any such product candidate
	for which we obtain favorable pivotal clinical trial results. We expect to continue to incur substantial additional expenses for product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution for our product candidates for which we obtain marketing
	approval. In addition, we will incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We do not expect to generate
	significant revenue from sales of any product for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on
	attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or
	product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.

	In July 2014, we completed an initial public offering, or
	IPO, of our common stock, and in August 2014 the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option in full. We received total net proceeds of approximately $66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock,

	of common stock, of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares were sold by certain of our stockholders, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase
	additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and
	marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements through the third quarter of 2017. See &#147;&#151;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#148;

	in the first quarter of 2014, have received only limited revenues from ReSure Sealant to date and anticipate only limited sales for 2016. ReSure Sealant is currently our only source of revenue from product sales. We may generate revenue in the

	In September 2013, we entered into a feasibility agreement with a biopharmaceutical company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot.
	Under this agreement, the biopharmaceutical company agreed to pay us up to $0.5 million under this feasibility study. In the event that the agreement was terminated in advance of the achievement of certain milestones, we would have been required to
	refund certain portions of the funding based on the actual work completed or milestones achieved as of the date of termination. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company completed the task related to the first milestone at which time the $0.3
	million became non-refundable. The biopharmaceutical company has indicated that they will not proceed with the second phase of the agreement. The Company does not have any further obligations in connection with this agreement.

	In October 2014, we entered into a feasibility agreement with a biotechnology company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot. Under
	this agreement, the biotechnology company has agreed to pay us up to $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million was a non-refundable up-front payment due upon contract execution and $0.4 million will be due upon the achievement of certain milestones.
	Initially, we were recognizing the non-refundable, non-contingent up-front payment of $0.3 million as revenue on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month period in which we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Estimates of this
	development period involves the evaluation of many assumptions and uncertainties and may change if facts and circumstances change. During 2015, management reevaluated and revised the estimated development period to extend through March 2016. If and
	when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received will be added to the total expected payments under the contract and recognized as revenue based on the proportional performance methodology. In January 2015,
	we achieved the first milestone under the feasibility agreement triggering a payment due of $0.3 million. Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has recognized revenue of $0.5 million related to this agreement and amounts deferred totaled
	$42,000 at December 31, 2015.

	believed were financial instruments that could require a transfer of assets because of the redemption feature of the underlying stock. Therefore, we classified these warrants as liabilities and they were remeasured to fair value at each reporting
	period, and we recorded the changes in the fair value as a component of other income (expense), net. Upon the closing of our IPO in July 2014, the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock, the preferred stock
	warrants became exercisable for common stock instead of preferred stock, and the fair value of the warrant liability became fixed as of that date and was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. In 2015, other income (expense), net consists of

	We analyze multiple-element arrangements based on the guidance in ASC Topic 605-25,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition&#151;Multiple-Element
	Arrangements
</I>
	, or ASC 605-25. Pursuant to this guidance, we evaluate multiple-element arrangements to determine (1)&nbsp;the deliverables included in the arrangement and (2)&nbsp;whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of
	accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting. This evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires us to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable
	from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and, if the arrangement includes a general right of
	return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control. In assessing whether an item has standalone value, we consider factors such as the research,
	manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can use the other deliverables for
	their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered item and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered elements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We allocate arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price
	method. Then, we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 to each of the separate units of accounting in determining the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. We determine the selling price of a unit of accounting
	following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	605-25.
</FONT>
	Accordingly, we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence, or
	VSOE, of selling price, if available; third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We typically use BESP to estimate the selling price as
	we generally do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for our units of accounting. Determining the BESP for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment. In developing the BESP for a unit of accounting, we consider applicable market conditions
	and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with our customer and estimated costs. We validate the BESP for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used
	to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting.

	We recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are
	satisfied for that particular unit of accounting. We will recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that have standalone value relative to the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement upon delivery. We will
	recognize as revenue arrangement consideration attributed to licenses that do not have standalone value relative to the other deliverables to be provided in an arrangement over our estimated performance period, as the arrangement would be accounted
	for as a single unit of accounting.

	At the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each
	milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether: (1)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the
	milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, (2)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (3)&nbsp;the consideration
	is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and
	the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone
	is substantive. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 605-28,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition&#151;Milestone Method

	Whenever we determine that an element is delivered over a period of time, revenue
	is recognized using either a proportional performance model or a straight-line model over the period of performance. At each reporting period, we reassess our cumulative measure of performance and make appropriate adjustments, if necessary. We
	recognize revenue using the proportional performance model whenever we can make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement. Revenue recognized under the proportional
	performance model at each reporting period is determined by multiplying the total expected payments under the contract (excluding payments contingent upon achievement of milestones) by the ratio of the level of effort incurred to date to the
	estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the arrangement. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using
	the proportional performance model as of each reporting period. Alternatively, if we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement, then revenue under the
	arrangement is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period expected to complete our performance obligations. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received is added to the total expected
	payments under the contract. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined on a straight-line basis as of the period end date. If we cannot reasonably
	estimate when our performance obligation period ends, then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation period ends.

	We base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with
	multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments
	made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical
	trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the
	performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status
	and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments

	been a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded group of peer companies and expect to continue

	Research and development expenses were $26.6 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015,
	compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The increase of $7.7 million was primarily due to an increase of $4.6 million in clinical trial and regulatory expenses and an increase of $3.1 million in unallocated expenses.

	For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we incurred $10.3 million in direct research and development expenses for our intracanalicular
	depot product candidates, including $2.1 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $5.5 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the
	treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 3 clinical trials, $0.7 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of inflammatory dry eye disease which was in Phase 2 clinical trials, and $2.0 million for our OTX-TP
	product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 2b clinical trials. In comparison, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we incurred $6.0 million in direct research and development expenses for our
	intracanalicular depot product candidates, including $2.0 million for clinical trials of OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was in Phase 2a clinical trials, $1.8 million for our DEXTENZA product candidate for the treatment of allergic
	conjunctivitis which was in Phase 2a clinical trials and $2.2 million for our DEXTENZA for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery which was in Phase 3 clinical trials. Unallocated research and development costs decreased $0.4
	million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. In the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we recorded a one-time, non-cash expense of $1.7 million for a license fee paid in the form of stock
	which is included in the unallocated costs. In addition, unallocated personnel costs increased by $3.5 million, relating to additional hiring primarily in our clinical, regulatory and quality department and an increase in stock-based compensation
	expense.

	$10.5 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase of $8.4 million was primarily due to an increase of $3.6 million in clinical trial and regulatory expenses and an increase of $4.9&nbsp;million in personnel costs and other

	candidate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis which was in Phase 2a clinical trials, and $2.0 million for our OTX-TP product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension which was also in Phase 2a clinical trials. In
	comparison, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we incurred $1.6&nbsp;million in clinical trial expenses, including $0.7&nbsp;million for clinical trials of OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension and $0.5&nbsp;million for our
	Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial of DEXTENZA for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. Unallocated research and development costs increased $4.9 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, compared to the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2013, due primarily to additional license fees paid to Incept in connection with the expansion of the scope of the license to include back-of-the-eye technology, which we paid by the issuance to Incept of 189,393 fully vested
	shares of our common stock having a fair value of $1.7 million on the issuance date and due to an increase in testing and laboratory supply costs. In addition, unallocated personnel costs increased by $1.6 million, relating to additional hiring

	General and administrative expenses were $6.9 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014,
	compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase of $5.2 million was due to a $3.4 million increase in personnel related costs, an increase of $1.1 million in professional fees and an increase of $0.7 million in
	facility related and other costs. Our personnel related costs increased due primarily to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $1.8 million as well as hiring in our general and administrative function. Professional fees increased
	primarily due to consultant fee of $0.7 million incurred in 2014 in connection with consulting services rendered by a former member of our board of directors and current stockholder of Incept, which we paid by the issuance of 79,545 fully vested
	shares of our common stock having a fair value of $0.7 million on the issuance date and increased activities to support our operating as a public company. Facility and other costs increased primarily due to general expense increases and to increased
	rent for additional space under our amended lease as well as additional insurance requirements to support operating as a public company.

	fair value of the underlying preferred stock. Interest expense also increased $0.7 million due to increased borrowings under our new credit facility.

	We have generated limited revenue to date. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from
	sales of ReSure Sealant. All of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability.
	Instead, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and
	OTX-TP.

	Through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock,
	public offerings of our common stock and borrowings under credit facilities. In July 2014, we completed our IPO, and in August 2014 the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option in full. We received total net proceeds of
	approximately $66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, including in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. In
	June 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The offering consisted of 4,600,000 shares of common stock, of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares
	were sold by certain stockholders, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million
	after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash and cash
	equivalents and marketable securities of $105.1 million. In April&nbsp;2014, we borrowed $15.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount under a new credit facility and used $1.9 million of this amount to repay $1.7 million aggregate principal
	amount of indebtedness and pay $0.2&nbsp;million of other amounts due in connection with our termination of a prior credit facility. In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million, extend
	the interest-only payment period through December 2016, and extend the maturity date to December&nbsp;1, 2019. The outstanding borrowings under this facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to 8.25%. See &#147;&#151;Contractual Obligations and

	or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions,
	such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. The covenants under our existing credit facility, the pledge of our assets as collateral and the negative pledge of intellectual property limit our ability to
	obtain additional debt financing. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish
	valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when
	needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market
	ourselves.

	Since our inception in 2006, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits
	for the net losses we have incurred in each year or our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of
	$60.8 million, which begin to expire in 2026, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $50.5 million, which begin to expire in 2029. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $3.0
	million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards $1.6 million, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2025, respectively. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, generally defined as a greater than 50%
	change (by value) in the equity ownership of our corporate entity over a three-year period, has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception, due to the significant costs and complexities associated with such
	studies. Accordingly, our ability to utilize our tax carryforwards may be limited. Additionally, U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be utilized against future taxes. As a result, we may not be able to take full
	advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes.

	The new guidance addresses management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Management&#146;s
	evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued. The standard will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods

	recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-14,
	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date. The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. The standard will be effective for public entities for annual

	designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and
	Exchange Commission&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
	under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#146;s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
	recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
	possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and

	are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
	Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a

	that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated on September&nbsp;12, 2006 under the laws of the State
	of Delaware. The Company is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using its proprietary hydrogel platform technology. The Company&#146;s
	bioresorbable hydrogel-based product candidates are designed to provide sustained delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye. Since inception, the Company&#146;s operations have been primarily focused on organizing and staffing the Company, acquiring
	rights to intellectual property, business planning, raising capital, developing its technology, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing initial quantities of its products and
	product candidates and building the initial sales and marketing infrastructure for the commercialization of the Company&#146;s approved product and product candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, new technological
	innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, compliance with government regulations, regulatory approval, uncertainty of market acceptance of products and the need to obtain additional financing. Product candidates
	currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company&#146;s lead product candidates were in development. There can be no assurance that the
	Company&#146;s research and development will be successfully completed, that&nbsp;adequate protection for the Company&#146;s intellectual property will be obtained, that any products developed&nbsp;will obtain necessary government regulatory
	approval and adequate reimbursement or that any approved products will be&nbsp;commercially viable. Even if the Company&#146;s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will generate significant revenue
	from product sales. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and&nbsp;substantial competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, the&nbsp;Company is dependent upon the services of its employees
	and consultants. The Company does not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of any product for several years, if at all. Accordingly, the Company will need to obtain additional capital to finance its operations. If the Company is unable
	to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or to relinquish valuable rights to its technologies, future
	revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to the Company. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining
	sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, if at all. The Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable it to fund its operating expenses, debt service
	obligations and capital expenditure requirements through the third quarter of 2017.

	general marketplace. In addition, the Company considers whether the collaboration partner can use the other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements, whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on

	Arrangement consideration that is
	fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. Then, the applicable revenue recognition criteria in ASC 605 are applied to each of the separate units of accounting in determining
	the appropriate period and pattern of recognition. The Company determines the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by ASC 605-25. Accordingly, the Company determines the estimated selling price for
	units of accounting within each arrangement using vendor-specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;) of selling price, if available; third-party evidence (&#147;TPE&#148;) of selling price, if VSOE is not available; or best estimate of selling

	performance to achieve the milestone, (ii)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance, and (iii)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. The Company evaluates
	factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment.

	the Company can make reasonably reliable estimates of the level of effort required to complete its performance obligations under an arrangement. Revenue recognized under the proportional
	performance model at each reporting period is determined by multiplying the total expected payments under the contract (excluding payments contingent upon achievement of milestones) by the ratio of the level of effort incurred to date to the
	estimated total level of effort required to complete the performance obligations under the arrangement. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using
	the proportional performance model as of each reporting period. Alternatively, if the Company cannot make reasonably reliable estimates the level of effort required to complete its performance obligations under an arrangement, then revenue under the
	arrangement is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period expected to complete the Company&#146;s performance obligations. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received is added to the
	total expected payments under the contract. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined on a straight-line basis as of the period end date. If the Company
	cannot reasonably estimate when its performance obligation period ends, then revenue is deferred until the Company can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation period ends.

	incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in loss from operations.

	Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or
	changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business
	in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset for recoverability, the Company
	compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
	result from the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. To date, the Company has
	not recorded any impairment losses on long-lived assets.

	The Company has entered into various research and development contracts with research institutions and other companies both inside and outside
	of the United States. Certain of these agreements have cancellation clauses, and related payments are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing research costs. When evaluating the
	adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the studies, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances
	at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company&#146;s estimates. The Company&#146;s historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from the actual costs.

	The Company
	recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest. In developing a forfeiture rate estimate, the Company has considered its historical experience to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures for service-based awards.
	The impact of a forfeiture rate adjustment will be recognized in full in the period of adjustment, and if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the Company&#146;s estimate, the Company may be required to record adjustments to
	stock-based compensation expense in future periods.

	The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
	liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or in the Company&#146;s tax returns. Deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
	basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the
	likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not
	be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning
	strategies.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by applying a two-step process to
	determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed
	more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50%
	likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and
	penalties.

	Prior to the closing of its IPO of common stock, the Company followed the two-class method when computing net income (loss) per share, as the
	Company had outstanding shares that met the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and
	participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends
	as if all income for the period had been distributed.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed
	by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting income
	(loss) attributable to common stockholders to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities, including outstanding stock options, unvested restricted common stock, common stock warrants and warrants for the
	purchase of Redeemable Preferred Stock. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
	outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, common stock warrants and unvested restricted common stock.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding prior to the IPO, contractually entitled the holders of such shares to participate
	in dividends but did not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in losses of the Company. Similarly, restricted stock awards granted by the Company entitle the holder of such awards to dividends declared or paid by the board
	of directors, regardless of whether such awards are unvested, as if such shares were outstanding common shares at the time of the dividend. However, the unvested restricted stock awards are not entitled to share in the residual net assets (deficit)
	of the Company. Accordingly, in periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common stockholders, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common
	stockholders, since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (&#147;ASU 2014-09&#148;). ASU 2014-09
	outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue
	recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
	consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date. The amendments in ASU 2015-14
	defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. The standard will be effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017 and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is
	permitted, but it cannot be any earlier than 2017 for calendar year-end entities. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting
	this new accounting guidance will have on its financial statements and footnote disclosures.

	direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. Prior to the issuance of the standard, debt issuance costs were required to be presented in the balance sheet as an

	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, &#147;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,&#148; to

	including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. Accordingly, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. There was no impact to the financial statements as a

	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-02, Leases (ASC 842), which requires lessees to recognize most

	reporting period within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. Lessees and lessors will be required to apply the new standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial
	statements in which they first apply the new guidance, using a modified retrospective transition method. The requirements of this standard include a significant increase in required disclosures. The Company is currently assessing the impact that
	adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its financial statements and footnote disclosures.

	The warrant liability was comprised of the values of warrants for the purchase of Series A, B and D redeemable convertible
	preferred stock and was based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represented a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company&#146;s valuation of the redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants utilized
	the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporated assumptions and estimates to value the preferred stock warrants. The Company assessed these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions

	The Company had a feasibility agreement with a biopharmaceutical company entered into in 2013. Under this agreement, the
	biopharmaceutical company agreed to pay up to $500 for completing certain tasks and achieving certain milestones. In the event that the agreement was terminated in advance of the completion of the tasks or achievement of the milestones, the Company
	would have been required to refund portions of the amounts received, based on the actual work completed or milestones achieved as of the date of termination. In 2014, the Company completed the tasks related to the first milestone at which time $250
	became non-refundable, therefore the Company recorded revenue of $250. The biopharmaceutical company has indicated that they will not proceed with the second phase of the agreement. The Company does not have any further obligations in connection
	with this agreement and no further payments will be received.

	In October 2014, the Company entered into a feasibility agreement with a
	biotechnology company. Under this agreement, the biotechnology company will pay up to $700, of which $250 was a non-refundable payment due upon contract execution and $450 will be due upon the achievement of certain milestones. The Company
	recognizes the total expected payments under the contract which include only the non-refundable payments on a straight-line basis over the estimated performance period. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional
	consideration to be received is added to the total expected payments under the contract to be recognized over the estimated performance period. During 2015, management reevaluated and revised the estimated development period to extend through March
	2016. In January 2015, the first milestone under the feasibility agreement was achieved triggering a non-refundable payment due of $250. The Company recognized revenue of $396 and $63 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014,
	respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company has deferred revenue of $42 and no accounts receivable related to this agreement. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had deferred revenue of $188 and accounts receivable of $250 related
	to this agreement.

	The Company entered into a credit and security agreement in 2014 (the &#147;2014 Credit Facility&#148;) which had a total
	borrowing capacity of $15,000 which was fully drawn down. As part of the 2014 Credit Facility a previously outstanding credit agreement issued in 2011 (the &#147;2011 Credit Facility&#148;) was terminated. Additional capacity of $5,000 available to
	be drawn down under the 2014 Credit Facility was not drawn down and this additional capacity is no longer available to the Company. Promissory notes issued under the 2014 Credit Facility were to mature on April&nbsp;1, 2018 and were collateralized
	by substantially all of the Company&#146;s personal property, other than its intellectual property. There were no financial covenants associated with the 2014 Credit Facility; however, there were negative covenants restricting the Company&#146;s
	activities, including limitations on dispositions, mergers or acquisitions; encumbering its intellectual property; incurring indebtedness or liens; paying dividends; making certain investments; and engaging in certain other business transactions.
	The obligations under the 2014 Credit Facility were subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including a material adverse change in the Company&#146;s business, operations or financial or other condition.

	The Company was obligated to make monthly, interest-only payments until September&nbsp;30, 2015 and, thereafter, to pay 30 consecutive, equal
	monthly installments of principal from October&nbsp;1, 2015 through March&nbsp;1, 2018 plus interest. The loan under the 2014 Credit Facility bears interest at an annual rate of 8.25%. In addition, a final payment equal to 3.75% of amounts drawn
	under the 2014 Credit Facility was due upon its maturity date. This amount was being accreted to the carrying value of the debt, using the effective interest method. In connection with the draw-down in 2014, the lenders received warrants to purchase
	100,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Series D-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock with an exercise price of $3.00 per share, which are exercisable until April 2021. The fair value of the warrants as of the issuance date totaling $326 was
	recorded as a preferred stock warrant liability. Of this amount, $290 was allocated to the 2014 Credit Facility and recorded as debt discount and $36 was allocated to the 2011 Credit Facility and recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt (see
	below). The effective annual interest rate of the outstanding debt under the 2014 Credit Facility was 11%.

	Credit Facility as an extinguishment in accordance with the guidance in ASC 470-50, Debt. The total amount of unamortized debt discount of $10 was reflected as a loss on extinguishment of debt and included in other expense within the statements of
	operations and comprehensive loss in 2014. Additionally, fees paid to the lenders that were allocated to the existing debt and treated as an extinguishment, inclusive of the value of warrants issued and debt issuance costs paid, totaling $47, were

	obligated to make monthly interest-only payments under the Amended 2014 Credit Facility until December&nbsp;31, 2016 and, thereafter, are required to make monthly payments of principal and interest from January&nbsp;1, 2017 through December&nbsp;1,
	2019. The interest rate under the Amended 2014 Credit Facility is unchanged at an annual rate of 8.25%. In addition, a final payment equal to 3.75% of amounts drawn under the Amended 2014 Credit Facility is due upon the new maturity date. There are
	no financial covenants associated with the Amended 2014 Credit Facility and the negative covenants remain unchanged. The Company accounted for the amendment of the Amended 2014 Credit Facility as a modification in accordance with the guidance in ASC
	470-50, Debt. Amounts paid to the lenders were recorded as debt discount and a new effective interest rate was established. The effective annual interest rate of the outstanding debt under the Amended 2014 Credit Facility is 10.6%.

	The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Prior to the
	Company&#146;s IPO in July 2014, the Company had been a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly
	traded set of peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. The expected term of the Company&#146;s stock options to employees has been
	determined utilizing the &#147;simplified&#148; method for awards that qualify as &#147;plain-vanilla&#148; options. The expected term of stock options granted to nonemployees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free
	interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S.&nbsp;Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the
	Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

	In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners,
	and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into
	indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The
	maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. The
	Company does not believe that the outcome of any claims under indemnification arrangements will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and it has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations
	in its financial statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income
	tax purposes of $60,831 and $50,492, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2029, respectively. Included in the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are approximately $1,876 of deductions related to the exercise of stock
	options for which the tax benefit will be realized when it results in the reduction of cash income tax in accordance with ASC 718. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company also had available research and development tax credit carryforwards for
	federal and state income tax purposes of $2,976 and $1,632, respectively, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2025, respectively. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject
	to a substantial annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards
	that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section&nbsp;382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation
	by more than 50% over a three-year period. The Company has not conducted a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since inception due to the significant complexity and cost
	associated with such a study. If the Company has experienced a change of control, as defined by Section&nbsp;382, at any time since inception, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards
	would be subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382, which is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company&#146;s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be
	subject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed
	and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.

	The Company has evaluated the positive and
	negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize the deferred tax assets, including the Company&#146;s history of cumulative net losses incurred since inception and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize
	the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at each reporting
	period.

	The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the
	Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending income tax examinations. The Company&#146;s tax years are still open under statute from December&nbsp;31, 2012 to the present.
	Earlier years may be examined to the extent that tax credit or net operating loss carryforwards are used in future periods. The Company&#146;s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income taxes as part of its income tax provision.
