	We have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our clinical and pre-clinical development activities. To date, we have
	financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt and, to a lesser extent, through grants from governmental agencies. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future
	expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations or additional grants. We have not completed pivotal clinical trials for any product candidate and it will be several years, if ever, before we
	have a product candidate ready for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates have received approval, and our

	If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product candidate to market

	Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials

	There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologics proceeding through clinical trials. A number of

	Although we have reached agreement with the FDA on the SPA relating to our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of VB-111 for
	rGBM, the agency&#146;s concurrence does not guarantee any particular outcome with respect to regulatory review of the pivotal trial or with respect to regulatory approval of VB-111.
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA normally requires two pivotal clinical trials to approve a biologic or drug product. The FDA typically does not consider a single clinical trial to be
	adequate to serve as a pivotal trial unless it is, among other things, well-controlled and demonstrates a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with potentially serious outcome, and a
	confirmatory trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Although we have reached agreement with the FDA on an SPA under which we agreed with the FDA that, if successful, our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial will be sufficient for approval,
	and even if we believe that the data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial are supportive, an SPA is not a guarantee of approval, and we cannot be certain that the design of, or data collected from, the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial will be
	adequate to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of VB-111 for the potential treatment of rGBM, or will otherwise be sufficient to support FDA or any foreign regulatory approvals. Indeed, while the FDA has accepted our planned safety database,
	the agency has stated that the adequacy of such database will depend on the magnitude of the clinical benefit and the adverse event profile.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Further, an
	SPA is not binding on the FDA if public health concerns unrecognized at the time the SPA is entered into become evident, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, or if we fail to comply with the agreed upon trial
	protocol. In addition, an SPA may be changed on written agreement of both parties, and the FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of an SPA and the data and results of clinical trials conducted under an SPA.
	Therefore, significant uncertainty remains regarding the clinical development of, and regulatory approval process for, VB-111 for rGBM, and it is possible that we might never receive any regulatory approvals for VB-111.

	The results from our clinical trials may not be sufficiently robust to support the submission for marketing approval for our product candidates. Before we

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	It is possible that, even if we achieve favorable results in our clinical trials, the FDA may require us to conduct additional clinical trials, possibly
	involving a larger sample size or a different clinical trial design, particularly if the FDA does not find the results from our completed clinical trials to be sufficiently persuasive to support a Biologics License Application, or BLA, or a New Drug
	Application, or NDA. For example, because the dose we used in our Phase 2 trial was limited by our production capacity, the dose of VB-111 that we intend to use in our Phase 3 pivotal trial may not be the maximum efficacious dose. If the FDA

	We have received fast track designation from the FDA for VB-111 for prolongation of survival in patients with glioblastoma that has recurred following

	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions,

	which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same use or indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the
	United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer
	justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the
	rare disease or condition.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from
	competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior

	Even if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction, the regulatory authority

	In particular, VB-111
	may face competition from currently approved drugs and drug candidates under development by others to treat rGBM. In May 2009, the FDA granted accelerated approval to Avastin (bevacizumab), which is an angiogenesis inhibitor, to treat patients with
	rGBM at progression after standard first-line therapy. In addition to bevacizumab, a number of companies are conducting late-stage clinical trials to test targeted drugs focused on angiogenesis inhibition for the treatment of ovarian cancer,

	Even if we are successful
	in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate faster than our competitors, we may face competition from biosimilars. In the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated
	approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be &#147;highly similar,&#148; or biosimilar, to or &#147;interchangeable&#148; with an FDA-approved biological product. This pathway could allow competitors to reference data from
	biological products already approved after 12 years from the time of approval. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for
	biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In Europe, a competitor may reference data from biological products already approved, but will not be able to market a biosimilar until ten years after the time of approval. This 10-year period
	will be extended to 11 years if, during the first eight of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an approval for one or more new therapeutic indications that bring significant clinical benefits compared with existing therapies.
	In addition, companies may be developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with our products. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our products, our products may become subject to
	competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of our applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity
	period has expired.

	In addition, although VB-111 has been granted orphan drug status by the FDA and EMA for a specified indication, there are limitations
	to the exclusivity. In the United States, the exclusivity period for orphan drugs is seven years, while pediatric exclusivity adds six months to any existing patents or exclusivity periods. In Europe, orphan drugs may be able to obtain 10 years of
	marketing exclusivity and up to an additional two years on the basis of qualifying pediatric studies. However, orphan exclusivity may be reduced to six years if the drug no longer satisfies the original designation criteria. Additionally, a
	marketing authorization holder may lose its orphan exclusivity if it consents to a second orphan drug application or cannot supply enough drug. Orphan drug exclusivity also can be lost when a second applicant demonstrates its drug is
	&#147;clinically superior&#148; to the original orphan drug.

	Finally, as a result of the expiration or successful challenge of our patent rights, we

	The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or
	maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for any of our product candidates that are approved could limit our ability to market those products and compromise our ability to generate revenue.
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The availability of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of our
	product candidates will depend substantially, both in the U.S. and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations,
	or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize
	our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions
	about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine
	will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no
	body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. For example, a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the United States and have not
	been approved for reimbursement in certain European countries.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The intended use of a drug product by a physician can also affect pricing. For example,
	CMS could initiate a National Coverage Determination administrative procedure, by which the agency determines which uses of a therapeutic product would and would not be reimbursable under Medicare. This determination process can be lengthy, thereby
	creating a long period during which the future reimbursement for a particular product may be uncertain.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Outside the United States, international
	operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries is likely to put pressure on the
	pricing and usage of any of our product candidates that are approved for marketing. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of
	medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in
	pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be
	insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United
	States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs, resulting in legislation and reforms such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new
	products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed
	healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has
	become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.

	addition, any new indication for an approved product also requires regulatory approval. If we produce an approved therapeutic product, we will rely on physicians to prescribe and administer it as
	we have directed and for the indications described on the labeling. It is not, however, uncommon for physicians to prescribe medication for unapproved, or &#147;off-label,&#148; uses or in a manner that is inconsistent with the manufacturer&#146;s
	directions. To the extent such off-label uses and departures from our administration directions become pervasive and produce results such as reduced efficacy or other adverse effects, the reputation of our products in the marketplace may suffer. In
	addition, off-label uses may cause a decline in our revenue or potential revenue, to the extent that there is a difference between the prices of our product for different indications.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, while physicians may choose to prescribe our drugs for off-label uses, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that
	are specifically approved by the FDA or other regulators. Although regulatory authorities generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians, they do restrict communications by companies with respect to off-label use. If our promotional activities
	fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in the
	FDA&#146;s refusal to approve a product, the suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution.

	time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may harm our reputation, delay our regulatory approval process, limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain, and compromise the market acceptance of any of

	date of such termination, our right to use the licensed technology would terminate. We may enter into additional agreements in the future with Crucell that may impose similar obligations on us. While we would expect to exercise all rights and

	We rely upon a
	combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and
	scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance
	that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue
	and even if such patents cover our product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in the patent claims being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents
	and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition
	from third parties.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our programs or product candidates fail to issue, if the
	breadth or strength of our patent protection is threatened, or if our patent portfolio fails to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates and
	threaten our ability to commercialize future products. Several patent applications covering our product candidates have been filed recently. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, applications will issue as patents, the breadth of any
	such issued patent claims or whether any issued claims will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of
	rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection
	could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any
	patent application related to a product candidate. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by a third party to determine who was the first to invent any of
	the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available,
	but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications. This risk is
	material in light of the length of the development process of our products and lifespan of our current patent portfolio.

	In addition to the protection
	afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements
	of our product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know- how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary
	technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by
	maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may
	otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Although we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to
	our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information
	will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently

	Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of
	litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter partes
	review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in
	which we are pursuing development candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of

	Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or
	patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently
	pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may be accused of infringing. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these
	patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of
	any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of
	competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we

	A significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their

	belong to the employer, absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer giving the employee service invention rights. The Patent Law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee, the Israeli
	Compensation and Royalties Committee, or the Committee, a body constituted under the Patent Law, shall determine whether the employee is entitled to remuneration for his inventions. Recent decisions by the Committee (which have been upheld by the
	Israeli Supreme Court on appeal) have created uncertainty in this area, as it held that employees may be entitled to remuneration for their service inventions despite having specifically waived any such rights. Further, the Committee has not yet
	determined the method for calculating this remuneration nor the criteria or circumstances under which an employee&#146;s waiver of his right to remuneration will be disregarded. We generally enter into assignment-of-invention agreements with our
	employees pursuant to which such individuals assign to us all rights to any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement with us. Although our employees have agreed to assign to us service invention rights, we may face claims

	If we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates,
	the defendant may contend that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid, unenforceable or fails to cover the product candidate or the infringing product. In patent litigation in the United States, defendants commonly allege that asserted
	patent claims are invalid and unenforceable. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet one or more of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, lack of written description, indefiniteness and
	non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. PTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties
	may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, such
	as opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation, amendments to our patent claims or statements being made on the record such that our claims may no longer be construed to cover our product candidates. The outcome following
	legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during
	prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity, unenforceability or non-infringement, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Even if resolved in our favor,
	litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be
	public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of
	our ordinary shares. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.

	As is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing
	patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore is costly, time- consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United&nbsp;States has recently enacted and is currently implementing
	wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in some situations. In addition to increasing
	uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the
	U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.

	Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the
	world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect
	intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or
	importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Potential competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and
	further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, if approved, and our patents or
	other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Many companies have encountered significant
	problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other
	intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights
	generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted
	narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially
	meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.

	As a foreign private issuer,
	we are permitted, and intend, to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of those otherwise required under the NASDAQ Stock Market for domestic U.S. issuers. For instance, we intend to follow home country practice in
	Israel with regard to the quorum requirement for shareholder meetings. As permitted under the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999, or the Companies Law, our articles of association provide that the quorum for any meeting of shareholders shall be the
	presence of at least two shareholders present in person, by proxy or by a voting instrument, who hold at least 25% of the voting power of our shares instead of the 33 1/3% of the issued share capital requirement. We may in the future elect to follow
	home country practices in Israel (and consequently avoid the requirements that would otherwise apply to a U.S. company listed on The NASDAQ Global Market) with regard to other matters, as well, such as the formation of compensation, nominating and
	governance committees, separate executive sessions of independent directors and non-management directors and the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events (such as for the establishment or amendment of certain
	equity-based compensation plans, issuances that will result in a change of control of the company, certain transactions other than a public offering involving issuances of a 20% or more interest in the company and certain acquisitions of the stock
	or assets of another company). Following our home country governance practices as opposed to the requirements that would otherwise apply to a U.S. company listed on The NASDAQ Global Market may provide less protection to you than what is accorded to

	to regulations under the Israeli Companies Law will require us to disclose, at the latest, in the notice for our 2015 annual meeting of shareholders, the annual compensation of our five most highly compensated officers on an individual, rather than
	aggregate, basis. However, this disclosure will not be as extensive as that required of a U.S. domestic issuer.

	Although Israel has entered into various agreements with Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, there has been an increase in unrest and terrorist
	activity, which began in October 2000 and has continued with varying levels of severity. The establishment in 2006 of a government in the Palestinian Authority by representatives of the Hamas militant group has created additional unrest and
	uncertainty in the region. In 2006, a conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah in Lebanon resulted in thousands of rockets being fired from Lebanon up to 50 miles into Israel. Starting in December 2008, for approximately three weeks, Israel engaged
	in an armed conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. In November 2012, for approximately one week, Israel
	experienced a similar armed conflict, resulting in hundreds of rockets being fired from the Gaza Strip and disrupting most day-to-day civilian activity in southern Israel. Beginning in July 2014, for approximately seven weeks, Israel experienced
	additional armed conflict between Israel and Hamas, which included rocket strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel. If renewed, these hostilities may negatively affect business conditions in Israel. In addition, Israel faces
	threats from more distant neighbors, in particular, Iran. Our insurance policies do not cover us for the damages incurred in connection with these conflicts or for any resulting disruption in our operations. The Israeli government, as a matter of
	law, provides coverage for the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war; however, the government may cease providing such coverage or the coverage might not be enough to cover potential damages. In
	the event that hostilities disrupt the ongoing operation of our facilities or the airports and seaports on which we depend to import and export our supplies and products, our operations may be materially adversely affected.

	In addition, since the end of 2010, numerous acts of protest and civil unrest have taken place in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, many
	of which involved significant violence. The civil unrest in Egypt, which borders Israel, resulted in the resignation of its president Hosni Mubarak, and to significant changes to the country&#146;s government. In Syria, also bordering Israel, a
	civil war is continuing to take place. The ultimate effect of these developments on the political and security situation in the Middle East and on Israel&#146;s position within the region is not clear at this time. Such instability may lead to

	connection with the 2006 conflict in Lebanon, and the December 2008 and November 2012 conflicts with Hamas, and it is possible that there will be additional call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant
	number of our employees related to military service or the absence for extended periods of one or more of our key employees for military service. Such disruption could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally,
	the absence of a significant number of the employees of our Israeli suppliers and contractors related to military service or the absence for extended periods of one or more of their key employees for military service may disrupt their operations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since we are incorporated under Israeli law, the rights and
	responsibilities of our shareholders are governed by our articles of association and Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some material respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders of U.S. corporations. In
	particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith and in a customary manner in exercising its rights and performing its obligations towards the company and other shareholders and to refrain from abusing its power in the
	company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on certain matters, such as an amendment to the company&#146;s articles of association, an increase of the company&#146;s authorized share capital, a merger of
	the company and approval of related party transactions that require shareholder approval. A shareholder also has a general duty to refrain from discriminating against other shareholders. In addition, a controlling shareholder or a shareholder who
	knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or to appoint or prevent the appointment of an officer of the company has a duty to act in fairness towards the company with regard to such vote or appointment.
	However, Israeli law does not define the substance of this duty of fairness. There is limited case law available to assist us in understanding the nature of this duty or the implications of these provisions. These provisions may be interpreted to
	impose additional obligations and liabilities on our shareholders that are not typically imposed on shareholders of U.S. corporations. See &#147;Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees&#151;Approval of Related Party Transactions Under
	Israeli Law&#151;Shareholders&#146; Duties.&#148;

	Israeli law regulates
	mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors, officers or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to such
	types of transactions. For example, a tender offer for all of a company&#146;s issued and outstanding shares can only be completed if the acquirer receives positive responses from the holders of at least 95% of the issued share capital. Completion
	of the tender offer also requires approval of a majority of the offerees that do not have a personal interest in the tender offer, unless at least 98% of the company&#146;s outstanding shares are tendered. Furthermore, the shareholders, including
	those who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer (unless the acquirer stipulated in its tender offer that a shareholder that accepts the offer may not seek appraisal rights), may, at any time within six months following the completion of the
	tender offer, petition an Israeli court to alter the consideration for the acquisition. See &#147;Item 10B. Memorandum and Articles of Association&#151;Acquisitions under Israeli Law&#148; for additional information.

	Further, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions undesirable to us or to some of our shareholders whose country of residence does not have
	a tax treaty with Israel granting tax relief to such shareholders from Israeli tax. For example, Israeli tax law does not recognize tax-free share exchanges to the same extent as U.S. tax law. With respect to mergers, Israeli tax law allows for tax
	deferral in certain circumstances but makes the deferral contingent on the fulfillment of a number of conditions, including, in some cases, a holding period of two years from the date of the transaction during which sales and dispositions of shares
	of the participating companies are subject to certain restrictions. Moreover, with respect to certain share swap transactions, the tax deferral is limited in time, and when such time expires, the tax becomes payable even if no disposition of the
	shares has occurred.

	Generally, if, for any taxable year, at least 75% of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the value of our assets is attributable to assets
	that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, including cash, we would be characterized as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of these tests, passive
	income includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or
	business. If we are characterized as a PFIC, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences, including having gains realized on the sale of our ordinary shares treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, the loss of the
	preferential rate applicable to dividends received on our ordinary shares by individuals who are U.S. holders, and having interest charges apply to distributions by us and the proceeds of share sales. See &#147;Item 10E. Taxation&#151;Certain

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since PFIC status depends on the
	composition of our income and the composition and value of our assets (which, assuming we are not a CFC for the year being tested, may be determined in large part by reference to the market value of our ordinary shares, which may be volatile) from
	time to time, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. However, because we had no revenue-producing operations, we believe that we were a PFIC for our 2015 taxable year. In addition, unless and until we
	generate sufficient revenue from active licensing and other non-passive sources and otherwise satisfy the asset test above, we expect to be treated as a PFIC in future taxable years.

	We also have been conducting a program targeting anti-inflammatory diseases, based on the use of our Lecinoxoid
	platform technology. Lecinoxoids are a novel class of small molecules we developed that are structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring molecules known to modulate inflammation. The lead product candidate from this program, VB-201,
	is a Phase 2-ready molecule that demonstrated efficacy in reducing vascular inflammation in a Phase 2 sub-study in psoriatic patients with cardiovascular risk. Due to business limitations associated with the heavy burden of developing medications
	for cardiovascular diseases, we chose to test it in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis; however, as we reported in February 2015, VB-201 failed to meet the primary endpoint in Phase 2 clinical trials for psoriasis and for ulcerative colitis. As a
	result, we have terminated our development of VB-201 in those indications. Nevertheless, based on recent pre-clinical studies, we believe that VB-201 and some second generation molecules such as VB-703 may be applicable for NASH and renal fibrosis.

	chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and radiation. On July&nbsp;1, 2014, the FDA concurred with the design and planned analyses of our Phase 3 pivotal trial of VB-111 in rGBM pursuant to an SPA. At the time,
	commencement of the trial was subject to our providing the agency with more information regarding our potency release assay for the trial. We developed this assay and submitted initial information to the FDA on May&nbsp;26, 2014. On February&nbsp;5,
	2015 the FDA has found our data satisfactory and removed the partial hold. We began our Phase 3 pivotal trial of VB-111 in rGBM in August 2015. According to the study protocol, an interim analysis will take place when 91 mortality events will occur
	in the trial. The timing of the interim analysis, which depends both on enrollment and on VB-111 activity, is expected in the first half of 2017. Full data will be available when 151 events will occur in the trial. Based on interactions with the
	FDA, we believe the current trial, if successful, will support a Biologics License Application (BLA) in 2018.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our innovative, proprietary VTS platform
	technology enables systemic administration of gene therapy to either destroy or promote angiogenic blood vessels. VTS is both tissue- and condition-specific, allowing for targeted and limited gene expression in endothelial cells, the thin layer of
	cells that lines the interior surface of blood vessels undergoing angiogenesis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our VTS platform technology comprises three components, a viral vector, a
	promoter and a transgene:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	1. Viral vector&#151;a modified virus that is used as a delivery vehicle to distribute the promoter and the transgene throughout
	the body.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	2. Promoter&#151;our proprietary, genetically modified promoter, called PPE-1-3X, that specifically targets the endothelial cells of angiogenic
	blood vessels. When present in these cells, the promoter initiates the expression of the transgene.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	3. Transgene&#151;a genetic sequence designed to yield
	a specific biologic effect, the expression of which is directed by PPE-1-3X. The particular transgene will vary depending on the therapeutic objectives of the product candidate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Once the gene therapy has reached the angiogenic blood vessels, the PPE-1-3X promoter activates expression of the transgene to produce a desired RNA or
	protein in the endothelial cells of those vessels. For oncology applications, the transgene selected is designed to destroy angiogenic blood vessels that feed solid tumors. For other potential applications, such as the treatment of ischemia, a
	different transgene can be selected that is designed to promote the development of angiogenic blood vessels instead of their destruction.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We designed VB-111 to address oncology indications, specifically solid tumors, by selectively targeting the blood vessels required for tumor
	growth and encouraging the programmed cell-death process, or apoptosis, of cells in those blood vessels. VB-111 is administered intravenously. PPE-1-3X is activated specifically in angiogenic endothelial cells and regulates a transgene consisting of
	a combination of two gene sequences known as Fas and TNFR1. When expressed, the transgene produces a unique pro-apoptotic protein, the Fas-TNFR1 chimera, that interacts with a native inflammatory molecule, Tumor Necrosis Factor, or TNF- alpha, and
	results in the destruction of newly formed or immature blood vessels. When activated by PPE-1-3X, specifically in angiogenic endothelial cells, this combination enables VB-111 to reduce tumor growth in a highly targeted manner.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, our preclinical studies suggest that there seems to be an immune inflammatory response to the presence of the viral vector and the Fas-TNFR1
	chimera that may contribute to the efficacy of VB-111. Further support for a potential role of the immune system as part of VB-111&#146;s mechanism of action comes from a recent observation that patients who developed fever as a response to VB-111
	administration, at least once along the treatment course, had a survival benefit over those who did not experience post-dosing fever.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The mechanism of VB-111 combines blockade of tumor vasculature with an anti-tumor immune response. This mechanism retains
	activity regardless of baseline tumor mutations or the identity of the pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumor. We believe that this mode of action makes VB-111 less susceptible to resistance and, therefore, potentially applicable for a broader
	patient population than current therapies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have conducted pre-clinical studies in animal models of lung cancer, colon cancer, thyroid cancer, rGBM and
	melanoma. Based on those studies, and clinical results to date, we believe that VB-111 has anti-angiogenic activity that may hold clinical promise and may be suitable for treatment of rGBM and other solid tumors. We also decided to focus on rGBM as
	our first indication because we expect the rapid kinetics of this disease will enable us to accumulate clinical data in a short time and, therefore, may facilitate development of VB-111 for this and other indications.

	well-tolerated and showed a dose- dependent extension in median overall survival across a range of tumor types. Based on these results, we decided to proceed with the development of VB-111 for the lead indication of rGBM, as well as to investigate
	VB-111 as a monotherapy for the treatment of thyroid cancer and, in combination with chemotherapy, for ovarian cancer. We have an open IND for VB-111 with the Office of Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapeutics within FDA&#146;s Center for Biologics

	We conducted an open-label Phase 2 trial in rGBM, which was originally initiated as an adaptive Phase 1/2 trial.
	The trial was intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VB-111, both by itself and in combination with bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenesis agent approved by the FDA for use in rGBM. In this trial, patients were initially dosed with VB-111 alone.
	After disease progression on VB-111 alone, they receive either bevacizumab alone as standard of care, or, in a second cohort, a combination of VB-111 and bevacizumab. Disease progression was defined as a worsening of the patient&#146;s cancer with
	an increase of at least 25% in the overall mass of measurable tumors, the appearance of new tumors, the worsening of non-measurable tumors since beginning of treatment, a need for an increased dose of corticosteroids or clinical deterioration.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On September&nbsp;28, 2015, we reported full Phase 2 data on VB-111 in combination with Bevacizumab (Avastin&#153;) in rGBM. Trial results include 46 patients
	with rGBM treated with VB-111; upon disease progression, 23&nbsp;patients were treated with VB-111 in combination with Avastin &#153; , and 22 received Avastin &#153; alone. One patient, who achieved a complete response, is still stable on VB-111
	alone at 22&nbsp;months and was included in the continuous exposure cohort. The median number of bi-monthly VB-111 doses was four for the continuous exposure cohort versus one in the limited exposure cohort (average of 4.6 vs. 2.2, respectively).
	Continuous exposure to VB-111 demonstrated significant improvement in overall survival, with median overall survival of 15&nbsp;months, compared to eight months in patients on limited VB-111 exposure (p=0.048), meeting the primary endpoint of the
	trial. VB-111 also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over the historical Avastin&#153; arm from the BELOB trial, which looked at efficacy of Avastin&#153; , lomustine or a combination of both agents, and reported a median overall
	survival of eight months for Avastin&#153; in 50&nbsp;patients with rGBM (p=0.005). Comparison of VB-111 data to historical control data of Avastin from 4 trials demonstrated that the 12 months overall survival in the Avastin pooled data (n=233) was
	28% compared to 57% in the VB-111 continuous exposure cohort (p=0.007).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Two complete responses and five partial responses were seen in the VB-111

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Trial data also suggest that VB-111 may induce an immuno-therapeutic effect. Of the 46 patients who received VB-111, 25 patients experienced a fever
	post-dosing of VB-111 at least once, while 21 patients did not. Patients with fevers demonstrated increased overall survival of 16 months, compared to patients without fevers, who had a median overall survival of 8.5 months (p=0.03). This
	correlation between clinical efficacy and fever suggests that VB-111 may induce an immune response in patients and supports a role of the immune system as part of VB-111&#146;s mechanism of action.

	In 62 patients with rGBM, the most frequent toxicity was self-limited fever, starting several hours post therapy and usually resolving within 24 hours and

	American women in 2013, according to the National Cancer Institute. In ovarian cancer, clinical trials of bevacizumab, which, like VB-111, is an anti-angiogenic agent, demonstrated some improvement in progression free survival in women with
	high-risk advanced ovarian cancer. Therefore, we are conducting an additional Phase 1/2 clinical trial in ovarian cancer, which combines VB-111 therapy with paclitaxel, a common chemotherapeutic agent used to treat ovarian cancer, to evaluate safety
	and efficacy in this indication. The trial is currently enrolling patients for the Phase&nbsp;2 phase, as the combination therapy merits further development.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of May&nbsp;30, 2015, 16 patients were enrolled in the trial, four of whom received low dose of VB-111 (3x10e12&nbsp;VP) together with paclitaxel at a
	lower (40mg)&nbsp;or full dose, whereas 12 patients received a full dose of both paclitaxel (80mg)&nbsp;and VB-111 (1x10e13 VP). Tumor response data were available for the four patients who received the low dose of VB-111, and ten out of
	12&nbsp;patients who received the higher dose of VB-111. Six out of the ten patients evaluated for tumor response at the high dose level (60%)&nbsp;met the Gynecological Cancer Intergroup criteria of at least 50% reduction in CA-125, three of whom
	were post-Avastin&#153; failure. None of the four patients treated with low dose VB-111 showed reduction in CA-125. As reference, the AURELIA trial reported CA-125 response in 11.6% of patients treated with chemotherapy and 31.8% CA-125 response in
	ovarian cancer patients treated with a combination of chemotherapy and Avastin&#153; (J Clin Oncol. 2014;32(13):1302-8).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of May&nbsp;30, 2015, all
	four patients treated with low dose VB-111 had died and the group had median OS of 6&nbsp;months, whereas eight of 12 patients who received high dose VB-111 were alive. As of February&nbsp;29, 2016, 20&nbsp;patients were enrolled in the trial. We
	have been following the patients for tumor response and survival data and expect to provide updated results from this Phase 2 study in the second quarter of 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe these data are another proof-of-concept for the safety of VB-111 in combination therapy, and are encouraged by the positive results in another type
	of solid tumor. We are considering launching a randomized controlled trial for VB-111 in ovarian cancer, subject to securing the required funding. We intend to discuss the data from this Phase&nbsp;2 trial with the FDA during the first half of 2016.

	comprise alternative functional transgenes. VB-511 is an anti-angiogenic candidate, while VB-211 and VB-411 are pro-angiogenic candidates that may be employed for ischemic conditions like peripheral vascular disease. All three candidates have
	demonstrated pre-clinical efficacy and are ready for toxicology. We may pursue further development of VB-511 internally, but we aim to partner-out the pro-angiogenic candidates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our proprietary Lecinoxoid platform technology comprises a family of orally administered small molecules designed to modulate the body&#146;s inflammatory
	response. Lecinoxoids are compounds that are structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring molecules, known as oxidized phospholipids, which possess immune modulating anti-inflammatory properties, modified to enhance stability and
	activity. We believe that Lecinoxoids hold significant promise in their ability to treat a range of chronic immune-based inflammatory diseases.

	The inflammatory response is a complex physiologic process balancing both pro- and anti- inflammatory components
	that interact intimately with the body&#146;s immune system. Oxidized phospholipids are instrumental in the interplay of these components that maintain equilibrium. When the inflammatory response is not adequately balanced, excess inflammation
	results and may cause both acute and chronic disease states.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead Lecinoxoid-based compound, VB-201, was designed as an oral agent for the control of chronic inflammatory disorders. It was clinically developed for
	psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, however, our recent Phase 2 data do not support further development for these indications. We believe that VB-201 may still have potential in other disorders in which TLR-2 and TLR-4 or monocytes play a role. In
	this regard, in March 2015 we presented preclinical findings at a Keystone scientific conference demonstrating that VB-201 can inhibit Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, or NASH, and liver fibrosis in a murine NASH model.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common liver disease in the western world. This pathological condition is characterized by lipid accumulation in
	hepatocytes and ranges from the non-progressive form termed steatosis to NASH, the progressive form that is prone to the development of cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure. NASH is characterized by fatty liver inflammation. Several studies
	have implicated TLR4 and its co-receptor CD14 in NASH and fibrosis. In addition, studies have emphasized the crucial role of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages for the progression of liver inflammation and fibrosis in experimental mouse models and
	in patients with liver cirrhosis. It has become clear that the macrophage compartment of the liver, traditionally called Kupffer cells, is greatly augmented by an overwhelming number of infiltrating monocytes upon acute or chronic liver injury.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	VB-201 inhibits the CD-14/TLR4 and TLR2 pathways as well as monocyte migration. Using an external CRO, we studied VB-201 in a mouse model of NASH and found
	that while treatment with VB-201 did not reduce steatosis, it significantly decreased liver lobular inflammation and liver fibrosis compared to vehicle treated mice.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Beyond VB-201, we have developed second and third generations of Lecinoxoid product candidates. Our results highlight the potential of some of these
	molecules, such as VB-703, a third generation candidate whose IP life-cycle can extend to the mid-2030s. In May 2015 at the DDW conference, we presented that VB-703 inhibits liver fibrosis by blocking TLR4 signaling pathways.

	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical
	company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class treatments for cancer. Our program is based on our proprietary Vascular Targeting System, or VTS, platform technology, which utilizes genetically targeted therapy
	to destroy newly formed, or angiogenic, blood vessels, and which we believe will allow us to develop product candidates for multiple oncology indications.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead product candidate, VB-111(ofranergene obadenovec), is a gene-based biologic that we are developing for solid tumor indications, with an advanced
	program for recurrent glioblastoma, or rGBM, an aggressive form of brain cancer. We have obtained fast track designation for VB-111 in the United States for prolongation of survival in patients with glioblastoma that has recurred following treatment
	with standard chemotherapy and radiation. We have also received orphan drug designation in both the United States and Europe. Our pivotal Phase 3 GLOBE study in rGBM began in August 2015. The study is being conducted under a special protocol
	assessment, or SPA, agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, with full endorsement by the&nbsp;Canadian Brain Tumor Consortium (CBTC) and is planned to recruit approximately 252 patients in the US, Canada and Israel.

	We also have been conducting a program targeting anti-inflammatory diseases based on the use of our Lecinoxoid
	platform technology. Lecinoxoids are a novel class of small molecules we developed that are structurally and functionally similar to naturally occurring molecules known to modulate inflammation. As we reported in February 2015, the lead product
	candidate from this program, VB-201, failed to meet the primary endpoint in Phase 2 clinical trials for psoriasis and for ulcerative colitis. As a result, we have terminated our development of VB-201 in those indications. Nevertheless, based on
	recent pre-clinical studies, we believe that VB-201 and some second generation molecules such as VB-703 may be applicable for NASH and renal fibrosis. Since the Company intends to focus substantially all of our efforts and resources on advancing our
	oncology program, we will seek to monetize our Lecinoxoid assets via strategic deals.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are developing our lead oncology product candidate, VB-111, for
	solid tumor indications, with current clinical programs in rGBM, thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer. In interim analyses of data from our ongoing open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of VB-111 in rGBM, we observed dose-dependent attenuation of tumor
	growth and an increase in median overall survival, which is the time interval from initiation of treatment to the patient&#146;s death. The U.S. FDA has granted VB-111 fast track designation for prolongation of survival in patients with glioblastoma
	that has recurred following treatment with temozolomide, a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and radiation. On July&nbsp;1, 2014, the FDA concurred with the design and planned analyses of our Phase 3 pivotal
	trial of VB-111 in rGBM pursuant to an SPA. At the time, commencement of the trial was subject to our providing the agency with more information regarding our potency release assay for the trial. We developed this assay and submitted initial
	information to the FDA on May&nbsp;26, 2014. On February&nbsp;5, 2015, the FDA found our data satisfactory and removed the partial hold. We began our Phase 3 pivotal trial of VB-111 in rGBM in August 2015. According to the study protocol, an interim
	analysis will take place when 91 mortality events will occur in the trial. The timing of the interim analysis, which depends both on enrollment and on VB-111 activity, is expected in the first half of 2017. Full data will be available when 151
	events will occur in the trial. Based on interactions with the FDA, we believe the current trial, if successful, will support a Biologics License Application (BLA) in 2018.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	VB-111 is also being studied in a Phase 2 trial for recurrent platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer and in a Phase 2 study in recurrent, iodine-resistant
	differentiated Thyroid Cancer. An interim analysis of the ovarian cancer study showed evidence of clinical benefit, and the Thyroid Cancer study met its primary endpoint of 6 month Progression Free Survival (PFS) with disease stabilization and
	safety.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had studied VB-111 in over 170 patients and have observed it to be well-tolerated. In December 2015, we have
	been granted a US composition of matter patents that provides intellectual property protection for VB-111 in the US until October 2033 before any patent term extension.

	We commenced operations in 2000, and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital,
	developing our VTS and Lecinoxoid platform technologies and developing our product candidates, including conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of VB-111 and VB-201. To date, we have funded our operations through private sales of
	preferred shares, a convertible loan, public offering and grants from the Israeli Office of Chief Scientist, or OCS, under the Israel Encouragement of Research and Development in Industry, or the Research Law. We have no products that have received
	regulatory approval and accordingly have never generated revenue. Since our inception and through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had raised an aggregate of $187.0 million to fund our operations, of which $113.4 million was from sales of our equity
	securities, $40.5 from our initial public offering, or IPO, $15 million from a November&nbsp;3, 2015 underwritten offering, and $18.1 million from OCS grants.

	Since inception, we have incurred significant losses. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our loss was $14.9 million, $17.4 million,
	and $17.4 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and losses for at least the next several years. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $142.0 million. Our losses may fluctuate
	significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, the receipt of payments under any future collaborations we may enter into, and our expenditures on other research and development activities.

	We

	from time to time and at our discretion, options to purchase our ordinary shares. The fair value of the services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognized as an expense in our statements of comprehensive loss and is carried to
	additional paid in capital in our statements of financial position. The total amount is recognized as an expense ratably over the vesting period of the options, which is the period during which all vesting conditions are expected to be met.

	requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a)&nbsp;the expected volatility of our shares, (b)&nbsp;the expected term of the award, (c)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate, and (d)&nbsp;expected dividends. Due to the lack of a
	public market for the trading of our shares until October 2014 and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historic volatility of a group of similar companies that
	are publicly traded. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available.

	We are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the
	estimates. Vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, we revise our estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the nonmarket
	vesting conditions. We recognize the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid in capital.

	of VB-111 in rGBM commenced in August 2015, offset by lower expenses for VB-201 and Psoriasis subcontractors and consultants of $2.8 million in 2015 as the clinical trials were completed by 2014 and payroll related expenses of $0.6 million due to an
	overall reduction of share based compensation expense and favorable currency exchange rates. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2014 was largely due to a $1.0&nbsp;million increase in the amounts of OCS grants received

	Until such

	liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a holder of our ordinary shares. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as
	incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our
	technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit,

	The agreement provided us with a waiver of rights by the Hospital and Tel Hashomer in connection with intellectual property developed by these inventors prior to the date of the agreement. In consideration for the waiver, we undertook to pay 1% of

	royalties of 3% to 3.5%. The maximum aggregate royalties paid generally cannot exceed 100% of the grants made to us, plus annual interest generally equal to the 12-month LIBOR applicable to dollar deposits, as published on the first business day of
	each calendar year. The total gross amount of grants actually received by us from the OCS as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 totaled approximately $18.1 million, and the balance of the principal and interest in respect of our commitments for future

	IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of
	IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement
	categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&amp;L. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities, there
	were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. The standard is effective for accounting
	periods beginning on or after January&nbsp;1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We have yet to assess IFRS 9&#146;s full impact.

	lessee accounting model whereby a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with a term that is greater than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value, and to recognize depreciation of leases assets
	separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement. As IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17, a lessor will continue to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and to
	account for those two types of leases differently. IFRS 16 is effective from January&nbsp;1, 2019 with early adoption allowed only if IFRS 15&#151;Revenue from Contracts with Customers is also applied. The Company is currently evaluating the impact

	is no factor that would impair the ability of the external director to exercise independent judgment. The definition of independent director under NASDAQ rules specifies similar, if slightly less stringent, requirements in addition to the
	requirement that the board of directors consider any factor which would impair the ability of the independent director to exercise independent judgment. In addition, external directors serve for a period of three years pursuant to the requirements
	of the Companies Law. However, external directors must be elected by a special majority of shareholders while independent directors may be elected by an ordinary majority. See &#147;&#151;External Directors&#148; for a description of the

	If it is determined that an office holder has a personal interest in a transaction, approval by the board of
	directors is required for the transaction, unless the company&#146;s articles of association provide for a different method of approval. Further, so long as an office holder has disclosed his or her personal interest in a transaction, the board of
	directors may approve an action by the office holder that would otherwise be deemed a breach of duty of loyalty. However, a company may not approve a transaction or action that is adverse to the company&#146;s interest or that is not performed by
	the office holder in good faith. An extraordinary transaction in which an office holder has a personal interest requires approval first by the company&#146;s audit committee and subsequently by the board of directors. The compensation of, or an
	undertaking to indemnify or insure, an office holder who is not a director requires approval first by the company&#146;s compensation committee, then by the company&#146;s board of directors, and, if such compensation arrangement or an undertaking
	to indemnify or insure is inconsistent with the company&#146;s stated compensation policy or if the office holder is the chief executive officer (apart from a number of specific exceptions), then such arrangement is subject to a Special Majority
	approval. Arrangements regarding the compensation, indemnification or insurance of a director require the approval of the compensation committee, board of directors and shareholders by ordinary majority, in that order, and under certain

	holds 25% or more of the voting rights in the company if no other shareholder holds more than 50% of the voting rights in the company. For this purpose, the holdings of all shareholders who have a personal interest in the same transaction will be
	aggregated. The approval of the audit committee, the board of directors and a Special Majority, in that order, is required for (a)&nbsp;extraordinary transactions with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal
	interest, (b)&nbsp;the engagement with a controlling shareholder or his or her relative, directly or indirectly, for the provision of services to the company, (c)&nbsp;the terms of engagement and compensation of a controlling shareholder or his or

	of such options and other shares received following any realization of rights with respect to such options, such as share dividends and share splits, must be registered in the name of a trustee selected by the board of directors and held in trust

	In June 2014, we adopted and obtained shareholder approval for our 2014 Plan and the U.S. Appendix thereto, which will become effective upon the closing of
	this offering. The 2014 Plan provides for the grant of options, restricted shares, restricted share units and other share- based awards to our directors, employees, officers, consultants, advisors and service providers, among others and to any other
	person whose services are considered valuable to us. Following the approval of the 2014 Plan by the Israeli tax authorities, we will only grant options or other equity incentive awards under the 2014 Plan, although previously-granted options and
	awards will continue to be governed by our 2000 Plan and 2011 Plan. The initial reserved pool under the 2014 Plan will be 928,288 ordinary shares, subject to adjustments as set forth in the 2014 Plan, including an automatic annual increase on
	January&nbsp;1 of each year such that the number of shares issuable under the 2014 Plan will equal 4% of our issued and outstanding share capital on a fully diluted basis on each such January&nbsp;1, or a lesser number of shares determined by the
	board of directors. The Board determined not to increase the number of shares reserved under the 2014 Plan during 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The 2014 Plan will be
	administered by our board of directors or by a committee designated by the board of directors, which shall determine, subject to Israeli law, the grantees of awards and the terms of the grant, including, exercise prices, vesting schedules,
	acceleration of vesting and the other matters necessary in the administration of the 2014 Plan. The 2014 Plan will enable us to issue awards under various tax regimes including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 102 and 3(i) of the Ordinance,
	and under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code. Options granted under the 2014 Plan to U.S. residents may qualify as &#147;incentive stock options&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, or may be non-qualified. The exercise price for
	&#147;incentive stock options&#148; must not be less than the fair market value on the date on which an option is granted, or 110% of the fair market value if the option holder holds more than 10% of our share capital.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We currently intend to grant awards under the 2014 Plan only to our employees, directors and officers who are not controlling shareholders and are considered
	Israeli residents, under the capital gains track of Section&nbsp;102(b)2 of the Ordinance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Awards under the 2014 Plan may be granted until June&nbsp;8,
	2034, 20 years from the date on which the 2014 Plan was approved by our board of directors, provided that awards granted to any U.S. participants may be granted until June&nbsp;8, 2024, 10 years from the date on which the 2014 Plan was approved by

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect that options granted under the 2014 Plan will generally vest over four years commencing on the date of grant such that
	50% vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant and an additional 6.25% vest at the end of each subsequent three-month period thereafter for 24 months. Options, other than certain incentive share options, that are not exercised within 20
	years from the grant date expire, unless otherwise determined by our board of directors or its designated committee, as applicable. Share options that qualify as &#147;incentive stock options&#148; granted to a person holding more than 10% of our
	voting power under the U.S. appendix to the 2014 Plan will expire within five years from the date of the grant and any other options granted under the U.S. appendix to the 2014 Plan will expire within 10 years from the date of grant. Except as

	In April 2011, we adopted the 2011 Plan. The term of the 2011 Plan is twenty years. Each option granted under the 2011 Plan entitles the

	substantially all of our assets, any unexercised outstanding options shall expire, provided that in case of merger or consolidation or the sale, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all our assets or shares, the surviving corporation does

	We have adopted a written policy which provides that the approval of the audit committee is required to effect specified actions and transactions with our
	directors, executive officers and controlling shareholders, or in which such persons have an interest. See &#147;Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees&#151;Approval of Related Party Transactions Under Israeli Law.&#148; The term
	&#147;controlling shareholder&#148; means a shareholder with the ability to direct the activities of our company, other than by virtue of being an executive officer or director. A shareholder is presumed to be a controlling shareholder if the
	shareholder holds 50% or more of the voting rights in a company or has the right to appoint the majority of the directors of the company or its general manager. For the purpose of approving transactions with controlling shareholders, as well as
	corporate approval of executive compensation, the term also includes any shareholder (or two or more shareholders having a personal interest in the same matter being brought for approval) that holds 25% or more of the voting rights of a company if
	the company has no shareholder that owns more than 50% of its voting rights. The transactions described below were entered into prior to the effectiveness of this policy.

	only distribute dividends that do not meet such criteria only with court approval. In each case, we are only permitted to distribute a dividend if our board of directors and the court, if applicable, determines that there is no reasonable concern

	A person wishing to acquire shares of

	make a tender offer to all of the shareholders who hold shares of the relevant class for the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of that class. If the shareholders who do not accept the offer hold less than 5% of the issued and
	outstanding share capital of the company or of the applicable class, and more than half of the shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the offer accept the offer, all of the shares that the acquirer offered to purchase will be

	provides that an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a special tender offer if, as a result of the acquisition, the purchaser would become a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights in the company, provided that

	For purposes of the shareholder vote, unless a court rules otherwise, the merger will not be deemed approved if a majority of the votes of shares represented

	25% or more of the directors of the other party, vote against the merger. If, however, the merger involves a merger with a company&#146;s own controlling shareholder or if the controlling shareholder has a personal interest in the merger, then the

	If the transaction would have been approved by the shareholders of a
	merging company but for the separate approval of each class or the exclusion of the votes of certain shareholders as provided above, a court may still approve the merger upon the request of holders of at least 25% of the voting rights of a company,

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon the request of a creditor of either party to the proposed merger, the court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there exists a

	The
	following is a brief summary of the material Israeli tax laws applicable to us, and certain Israeli Government programs that may benefit us. This section also contains a discussion of material Israeli tax consequences concerning the ownership and
	disposition of our ordinary shares purchased by investors. This summary does not discuss all the aspects of Israeli tax law that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of his or her personal investment circumstances or to some types of
	investors subject to special treatment under Israeli law. Examples of such investors include residents of Israel or traders in securities who are subject to special tax regimes not covered in this discussion. Because parts of this discussion are
	based on new tax legislation that has not yet been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, we cannot assure you that the appropriate tax authorities or the courts will accept the views expressed in this discussion. The discussion below
	is subject to change, including due to amendments under Israeli law or changes to the applicable judicial or administrative interpretations of Israeli law, which change could affect the tax consequences described below.

	An
	investment program that is implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law prior to the 2005 Amendment, referred to as an &#147;Approved Enterprise,&#148; is entitled to certain benefits. A company that wished to receive benefits
	as an Approved Enterprise must have received approval from the Investment Center of the Israeli Ministry of the Economy (formerly the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor), or the Investment Center. Each certificate of approval for an Approved
	Enterprise relates to a specific investment program in the Approved Enterprise, delineated both by the financial scope of the investment and by the physical characteristics of the facility or the asset.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In general, an Approved Enterprise is entitled to receive a grant from the Government of Israel or an alternative package of tax benefits, known as the
	alternative benefits track. The tax benefits from any certificate of approval relate only to taxable income attributable to the specific Approved Enterprise. Income derived from activity that is not integral to the activity of the Approved
	Enterprise does not enjoy tax benefits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, a company that has an Approved Enterprise program is eligible for further tax benefits if it
	qualifies as a Foreign Investors&#146; Company (&#147;FIC&#148;), which is a company with a level of foreign investment, as defined in the Investment Law, of more than 25%. The level of foreign investment is measured as the percentage of rights in
	the company (in terms of shares, rights to profits, voting and appointment of directors), and of combined share capital and loans, that are owned, directly or indirectly, by persons who are not residents of Israel. The determination as to whether a
	company qualifies as an FIC is made on an annual basis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If a company elects the alternative benefits track and distributes a dividend out of income
	derived by its Approved Enterprise during the tax exemption period it will be subject to corporate tax in respect of the amount of the dividend (grossed-up to reflect the pre-tax income that it would have had to earn in order to distribute the
	dividend) at the corporate tax rate which would have been applicable without the tax exemption under the alternative benefits track. In addition, dividends paid out of income attributed to an Approved Enterprise are generally subject to withholding
	tax at source at the rate of 15% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty.

	The 2005 Amendment provides that a certificate of approval from the Investment Center will only be necessary for receiving cash
	grants. As a result, it was no longer necessary for a company to obtain an Approved Enterprise certificate of approval in order to receive the tax benefits previously available under the alternative benefits track. Rather, a company may claim the
	tax benefits offered by the alternative benefits track directly in its tax returns, provided that it meets the criteria for tax benefits set forth in the amendment. In order to receive the tax benefits, the 2005 Amendment states that a company must
	make an investment which meets all of the conditions, including a minimum qualifying investment in certain productive assets as specified in the Investment Law. Such investment allows a company to receive &#147;Benefited Enterprise&#148; status, and
	may be made over a period of no more than three years culminating with the end of the Benefited Enterprise election year.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The extent of the tax benefits
	available under the 2005 Amendment to qualifying income of a Benefited Enterprise depends on, among other things, the geographic location in Israel of the Benefited Enterprise. The location will also determine the period for which tax benefits are
	available. Such tax benefits include an exemption from corporate tax on undistributed income generated by the Benefited Enterprise for a period of between two to ten years, depending on the geographic location of the Benefited Enterprise in Israel,
	and a reduced corporate tax rate of between 10% to 25% for the remainder of the benefits period, depending on the level of foreign investment in the company in each year. The benefits period is limited to 12 or 14 years from the beginning of the
	Benefited Enterprise election year, depending on the location of the Benefited Enterprise. We informed the Israeli Tax Authority of our choice of 2012 as a Benefited Enterprise election year. A company qualifying for tax benefits under the 2005
	Amendment which pays a dividend out of income derived by its Benefited Enterprise during the tax exemption period will be subject to corporate tax in respect of the amount of the dividend (grossed-up to reflect the pre-tax income that it would have
	had to earn in order to distribute the dividend) at the corporate tax rate which would have otherwise been applicable. Dividends paid out of income attributed to a Benefited Enterprise are generally subject to withholding tax at source at the rate
	of 15%-20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The benefits available to a Benefited Enterprise are subject to the
	fulfillment of conditions stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations. If a company does not meet these conditions, in a given tax year during the benefits period, it would generally not be eligible for tax benefits during such tax year;
	however, the company&#146;s eligibility for tax benefits in prior and future years should not be impacted.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We currently have one Benefited Enterprise
	program under the Investments Law, which, we believe, may entitle us to certain tax benefits. The tax benefit period for this program has not yet commenced but is expected to end no later than the end of tax year 2023 or tax year 2025. During the
	benefits period, which shall commence with the year we will first earn taxable income relating to such enterprise, subject to the 12 or 14 year limitation described above, and shall run for a period of up to 10 years (assuming FIC status), a
	corporate tax exemption is expected to apply with respect to the taxable income from our Benefited Enterprise program (once generated) generated during the first two years of the benefits period (so long as it remains undistributed) and reduced

	shares at the rate of 25%, unless relief is provided in a treaty between Israel and the shareholder&#146;s country of residence, subject to receipt of a valid certificate from the Israeli Tax Authority allowing for such reduced rate. With respect to
	a person who is a &#147;substantial shareholder&#148; at the time of receiving the dividend or at any time during the preceding twelve months, the applicable withholding tax rate is 30%. Furthermore, an additional 2% tax might be applicable to
	individual shareholders if certain conditions are met. A &#147;substantial shareholder&#148; is generally a person who alone or together with such person&#146;s relative or another person who collaborates with such person on a permanent basis,
	holds, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any of the &#147;means of control&#148; of the corporation. &#147;Means of control&#148; generally include the right to vote, receive profits, nominate a director or an executive officer, receive assets
	upon liquidation, or order someone who holds any of the aforesaid rights how to act, regardless of the source of such right. Notwithstanding the above, dividends paid to a non-Israeli resident &#147;substantial shareholder&#148; on publicly traded
	shares, like our ordinary shares, which are held via a &#147;nominee company&#148; (as defined under the Securities Law, 1968), are generally subject to Israeli withholding tax at a rate of 25%, unless a different rate is provided under an
	applicable tax treaty, provided that a certificate from the Israeli Tax Authority allowing for a reduced withholding tax rate is obtained in advance. Under the United States-Israel Tax Treaty, the maximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on
	dividends paid to a holder of our ordinary shares who is a U.S. resident (for purposes of the United States- Israel Tax Treaty) is 25%. Unless a reduced tax rate is provided under an applicable tax treaty, a distribution of dividends to non-Israeli
	residents is subject to withholding tax at source at a rate of 15% if the dividend is distributed from income attributed to an Approved Enterprise or a Benefited Enterprise, while a 20% rate applies if the dividend is distributed from income
	attributed to a Preferred Enterprise. We cannot assure you that in the event we declare a dividend we will designate the income out of which the dividend is paid in a manner that will reduce shareholders&#146; tax liability.

	Subject to the discussion under
	&#147;&#151;Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,&#148; below, if you are a U.S. Holder, the gross amount of any distribution made to you with respect to our ordinary shares before reduction for any Israeli taxes withheld therefrom,
	other than certain distributions, if any, of our ordinary shares distributed pro rata to all our shareholders, generally will be includible in your income as dividend income to the extent such distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated
	earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent that the amount of any distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, it
	will generally be treated first as a return of your adjusted tax basis in our ordinary shares and thereafter as either long-term or short-term capital gain depending upon whether the U.S. Holder has held our ordinary shares for more than one year as
	of the time such distribution is received. We do not expect to maintain calculations of our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles. Therefore, U.S. Holders should expect that the entire amount of any distribution generally
	will be reported as dividend income. Non-corporate U.S. Holders may qualify for the preferential rates of taxation with respect to dividends on ordinary shares applicable to long-term capital gains (i.e., gains from the sale of capital assets held
	for more than one year) applicable to qualified dividend income (as discussed below). The Company, which is incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel, believes that it qualifies as a resident of Israel for purposes of, and is eligible for
	the benefits of, the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the State of Israel with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed on November&nbsp;20, 1975, as amended and currently in force, or the U.S.-Israel
	Tax Treaty, although there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, the IRS has determined that the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty is satisfactory for purposes of the qualified dividend rules and that it includes an exchange-of-information program.
	Therefore, subject to the discussion under &#147;&#151;Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,&#148; below, if the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty is applicable, such dividends will generally be &#147;qualified dividend income&#148; in the hands
	of individual U.S. Holders, provided that certain conditions are met, including holding period and the absence of certain risk reduction transaction requirements are met. The dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction
	generally allowed to corporate U.S. Holders.

	U.S. Holders generally may claim the amount of Israel withholding tax withheld either as a deduction from
	gross income or as a credit against U.S. federal income tax liability. However, the foreign tax credit is subject to numerous complex limitations that must be determined and applied on an individual basis. Generally, the credit cannot exceed the
	proportionate share of a U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax liability that such U.S. Holder&#146;s &#147;foreign source&#148; taxable income bears to such U.S. Holder&#146;s worldwide taxable income. In applying this limitation, a U.S.

	with respect to the ordinary shares that is treated as a &#147;dividend&#148; may be lower for U.S. federal income tax purposes than it is for Israeli income tax purposes, potentially resulting in a reduced foreign tax credit for the U.S. Holder.

	In general, the amount of a distribution paid to a U.S.
	Holder in a foreign currency will be the dollar value of the foreign currency calculated by reference to the spot exchange rate on the day the U.S. Holder receives the distribution, regardless of whether the foreign currency is converted into U.S.
	dollars at that time. Any foreign currency gain or loss a U.S. Holder realizes on a subsequent conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss. If dividends received in foreign currency are converted into
	U.S. dollars on the day they are received, a U.S. Holder generally should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend.

	Subject to the discussion below under &#147;&#151;Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,&#148; if you are a U.S. Holder, you generally will
	recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our ordinary shares equal to the difference between the amount realized on such sale, exchange or other taxable disposition and your adjusted tax basis in our ordinary
	shares, and such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. The adjusted tax basis in an ordinary share generally will be equal to the cost of such ordinary share. If you are a non-corporate U.S. Holder, capital gain from the sale, exchange or other
	taxable disposition of ordinary shares is generally eligible for a preferential rate of taxation applicable to capital gains, if your holding period determined at the time of such sale, exchange or other taxable disposition for such ordinary shares
	exceeds one year (i.e., such gain is long-term capital gain). The deductibility of capital losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitations under the Code. Any such gain or loss that a U.S. Holder recognizes generally will be
	treated as U.S. source income or loss for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For a cash basis taxpayer, units of foreign currency paid or received
	are translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. In that case, no foreign currency exchange gain or loss will result from currency fluctuations between the trade date and the settlement date of such a
	purchase or sale. An accrual basis taxpayer, however, may elect the same treatment required of cash basis taxpayers with respect to purchases and sales of our ordinary shares that are traded on an established securities market, provided the election
	is applied consistently from year to year. Such election may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. For an accrual basis taxpayer who does not make such election, units of foreign currency paid or received are translated into U.S. dollars at
	the spot rate on the trade date of the purchase or sale. Such an accrual basis taxpayer may recognize exchange gain or loss based on currency fluctuations between the trade date and the settlement date. Any foreign currency gain or loss a U.S.
	Holder realizes will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

	Passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, gains from commodities
	and securities transactions, the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets which produce passive income, and includes amounts derived by reason of the temporary investment of funds raised in offerings of our ordinary shares. If a
	non-U.S. corporation owns directly or indirectly at least 25% by value of the stock of another corporation, the non-U.S. corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation
	and as receiving directly its proportionate share of the other corporation&#146;s income. If we are classified as a PFIC in any year with respect to which a U.S. Holder owns our ordinary shares, we will continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect
	to such U.S. Holder in all succeeding years during which the U.S. Holder owns our ordinary shares, regardless of whether we continue to meet the tests described above.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We must determine our PFIC status annually based on tests which are factual in nature, and our status will depend on our income, assets and activities each

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However, because we had no revenue-producing operations, we believe that we were a PFIC for our 2015 taxable year. In addition, unless and until we
	generate sufficient revenue from active licensing and other non-passive sources and otherwise satisfy the asset test above, we expect to be treated as a PFIC in future taxable years.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If we are a PFIC, and you are a U.S. Holder, then unless you make one of the elections described below, a special tax regime will apply to both (a)&nbsp;any
	&#147;excess distribution&#148; by us to you (generally, your ratable portion of distributions in any year which are greater than 125% of the average annual distribution received by you in the shorter of the three preceding years or your holding
	period for our ordinary shares) and (b)&nbsp;any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares. Under this regime, any excess distribution and realized gain will be treated as ordinary income and will be subject to tax as if
	(a)&nbsp;the excess distribution or gain had been realized ratably over your holding period, (b)&nbsp;the amount deemed realized in each year had been subject to tax in each year of that holding period at the highest marginal rate for such year
	(other than income allocated to the current period or any taxable period before we became a PFIC, which would be subject to tax at the U.S. Holder&#146;s regular ordinary income rate for the current year and would not be subject to the interest
	charge discussed below), and (c)&nbsp;the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax had been imposed on the taxes deemed to have been payable in those years. In addition, dividend distributions made to you will not qualify for the
	lower rates of taxation applicable to long-term capital gains discussed above under &#147;Distributions.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Certain elections exist that may alleviate
	some of the adverse consequences of PFIC status and would result in an alternative treatment (such as mark-to-market treatment) of our ordinary shares. If a U.S. Holder makes the mark-to-market election, the U.S. Holder generally will recognize as
	ordinary income any excess of the fair market value of the ordinary shares at the end of each taxable year over their adjusted tax basis, and will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of any excess of the adjusted tax basis of the ordinary shares
	over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election). If a U.S. Holder makes the election, the U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in
	the ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect these income or loss amounts. Any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as an
	ordinary loss (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election). The mark-to-market election is available only if we are a PFIC and our ordinary shares are &#147;regularly
	traded&#148; on a &#147;qualified exchange.&#148; Our ordinary shares will be treated as &#147;regularly traded&#148; in any calendar year in which more than a de minimis quantity of the ordinary shares are traded on a qualified exchange on at least
	15 days during each calendar quarter (subject to the rule that trades that have as one of their principle purposes the meeting of the trading requirement as disregarded). The NASDAQ Global Market is a qualified exchange for this purpose and,
	consequently, if the ordinary shares are regularly traded, the mark-to-market election will be available to a U.S. Holder.

	We do not currently intend to

	25% of our expenses in 2015 were denominated in New Israeli Shekels and 3% in Euros. Changes of 5% and 10% in the US$/NIS or the US$/Euro exchange rate will increase or decrease the operation expenses by up to 1% and 0.2%, respectively.

	limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
	evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	Our management, including our CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act, of the effectiveness, as of
	the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
	(2013). Based on the results of this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our
	disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
	system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
	limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
	two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
	achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
	limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

	IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value
	through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities, there were no changes to
	classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or
	after January&nbsp;1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. IFRS 9 is to be applied retrospectively. The Company is yet to assess IFRS 9&#146;s full impact.

	With respect to grants to employees, the value of the labor services received from them in return is measured on the date of grant based on the
	fair value of the equity instruments granted to the employees. For options granted prior to the Company&#146;s IPO in order to measure the fair value of the labor service received, the Company first measured the share value by using the income
	approach method which is an analysis that involves forecasting the appropriate cash flow stream over an appropriate period and then discounting it back to a present value at an appropriate discount rate. This discount rate should consider the time
	value of money, inflation, and the risk inherent in ownership of the asset or security interest being valued. Once the share value was estimated, the Company used the Black-Scholes model to value the equity instrument. Since the Company was not
	publicly traded, it looked for comparable companies in the healthcare sector to set the volatility assumption and estimated the equity instrument&#146;s life.

	opportunity was achieved. The Convertible Loan is denominated in U.S. dollars and bore an annual interest rate of 10%. The principal shall automatically convert upon the earlier of: (i)&nbsp;a financing round for investment in preferred convertible
	shares of the Company superior to the Preferred D Shares in liquidation preference, in which case the conversion will automatically be into the new round Preferred Shares at an average discount of 22.7%, (ii)&nbsp;immediately prior to an IPO, in
	which case the conversion will automatically be into 1,153,773 Preferred D-1 shares or (iii)&nbsp;on April&nbsp;30, 2014, in which case the conversion will automatically be into 1,153,773 Preferred D-1 Shares. The lenders had the right to demand
	repayment of the principal amount plus interest only on the occurrence of the earlier of the following events: (i)&nbsp;an event of acceleration as defined in the CLA, (ii)&nbsp;any of the distribution events described in the Articles of Association
	or (iii)&nbsp;the consummation by the Company of a transaction generating proceeds to the Company of at least $20.0 million.

	In February 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with Tel Hashomer&#151;Medical Research, Infrastructure and Services Ltd. (&#147;Tel Hashomer&#148;). The agreement with Tel Hashomer provides that the
	Company will pay 1% of any net sales of any product covered by the intellectual property covered under the agreement and 2% of any consideration received by the Company for granting a license or similar rights to such intellectual property. Such
	amounts will be recorded as part of the Company&#146;s cost of revenues. In addition, upon the occurrence of an exit event such as a merger, sale of all shares or assets or the closing of an initial public offering such as the IPO, the Company is
	required to pay to Tel Hashomer 1% of the proceeds received by the Company or its shareholders as the case may be. Royalty and all other payment obligations under this agreement will expire once the Company has paid an aggregate sum of NIS
	100&nbsp;million (approximately $26 million) to Tel Hashomer by way of pay out, exit proceeds and licensing consideration. Amounts previously paid as royalties on any net sales will not be taken into account when calculating this aggregate sum.
	Amounts payable upon occurrence of an exit event is not considered to be probable until actual occurrence. Upon occurrence of such event, as such event does not represent a substantive milestone with regard to the Company&#146;s intellectual
	property, the amount to be paid is recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Loss under research and development costs.

	On November&nbsp;3, 2015, the Company entered into an underwritten offering of 2,500,000 ordinary shares together with accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,250,000 ordinary shares. The ordinary
	shares and warrants were sold in combination, with one warrant for each ordinary share sold, and represented the right to purchase 0.50 of an ordinary share. The combined offering price of each ordinary share and accompanying warrant was $6.00. The
	net proceeds from this offering, which closed on November&nbsp;6, 2015 were $13.6 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. The warrants will be exercisable beginning on
	May&nbsp;6, 2016 and will expire on May&nbsp;6, 2021 at an exercise price of $7.50 per one ordinary share. The ordinary shares and warrants were immediately separable and were issued separately. The fair value of the separable warrants on the date
	of grant was computed using the Black-Scholes model. The underlying data used for computing the fair value of the warrants are mainly as follows: ordinary share price based on the share&#146;s price at the stock market on November&nbsp;3, 2015:
	$6.01; expected volatility based on comparable companies in the healthcare sector: 69.0%; risk-free interest rate: 1.59% (the risk-free interest rate is determined based on rates of return on maturity of unlinked treasury bonds with time to maturity
	that equals the average life of the warrants); expected dividend: zero; and expected life to exercise of 5.5 years. The consideration was allocated between ordinary shares and warrants based on the ratio of the warrants&#146; fair value and the
	ordinary share price.
