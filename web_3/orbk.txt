</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements and information with respect to, among other things, the business, the
	industries in which the Company operates, the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives and competitive position of the Company, which statements can often be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as
	&#145;believes&#146;, &#145;expects&#146;, &#145;may&#146;, &#145;will&#146;, &#145;should&#146; or &#145;anticipates&#146;, the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or as part of discussions of strategy and
	trends. Such statements include, but are not limited to, certain statements appearing in Item 3 - Key Information - Risk Factors; Item 4 - Information on the Company; and Item 5 - Operating and Financial Review and Prospects regarding trends in the
	electronics, recognition software, solar energy and other industries relevant to the Company, revenues, net income, industry size, competitive position, market demands, volumes, prices, margins, research and development, capital expenditures,
	patents, the effect of technological developments, strategy and management objectives, opinions and outlook for 2017 and beyond. Such statements are derived from beliefs and assumptions of the Company&#146;s management based, in part, upon
	information available to the Company as of the date of this Annual Report. They reflect the views of the Company as of the date of this Annual Report with respect to market conditions and future events and are inherently subject to various risks,
	uncertainties and other factors that may affect the ability of the Company to implement its business strategy and/or may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements expressed herein. These risks, uncertainties
	and factors include, but are not limited to, cyclicality in the industries in which the Company operates, the Company&#146;s production capacity, timing and occurrence of product acceptance (the Company defines &#145;bookings&#146; and
	&#145;backlog&#146; as purchase arrangements with customers that are based on mutually agreed terms, which, in some cases for bookings and backlog, may still be subject to completion of written documentation and may be changed or cancelled by the
	customer, often without penalty), fluctuations in product mix, worldwide economic conditions generally, especially in the industries in which the Company operates, the timing and strength of product and service offerings by the Company and its
	competitors, changes in business or pricing strategies, changes in the prevailing political and regulatory framework in which the relevant parties operate, including as a result of the United Kingdom&#146;s prospective withdrawal from the European
	Union (known as &#147;
<B>
	Brexit
</B>
	&#148;) and administration change in the United States, or in economic or technological trends or conditions, including currency fluctuations, inflation and consumer confidence, on a global, regional or national
	basis, the level of consumer demand for sophisticated devices such as smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices as well as automobiles, the Company&#146;s global operations and its ability to comply with varying legal, regulatory, exchange,
	tax and customs regimes, the timing and outcome of tax audits, including the ongoing audit in Israel (the amount of taxable income is subject to ongoing audit by the Israel tax authority and such audits often result in proposed assessments and any
	estimation of the potential outcome of an uncertain tax issue is a matter for judgment, which can be subjective and highly complex; however, the Company believes that it has provided adequately for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to the
	tax audit, but future results may include favorable or unfavorable material adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the periods when the assessments are made or resolved or the audit is closed), the Company&#146;s ability to achieve strategic
	initiatives, including related to its acquisition strategy, the Company&#146;s debt and corporate financing activities; the timing, final outcome and impact of the criminal matter and ongoing investigation in Korea, including any impact on existing
	or future business opportunities in Korea and elsewhere, any civil actions related to the Korean Matter (as defined below) brought by third parties, including the Company&#146;s customers, which may result in monetary judgments or settlements,
	expenses associated with the Korean Matter and the other matters discussed under Item 3 - Key Information - Risk Factors.

	Many of the
	above factors are beyond the control of the Company and almost all of them are difficult or impossible to predict with accuracy. Therefore, the Company cautions each reader of this Annual Report to consider carefully these, as well as any other
	specific factors discussed with each forward-looking statement in this Annual Report and as may be disclosed in the Company&#146;s future filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;
<B>
	SEC
</B>
	&#148;). For more
	information regarding the above factors and other risks, see Item 3 - Key Information - Risk Factors.

	Our business relies
	considerably upon continuing capital investments by manufacturers of PCBs, FPDs and SDs. The capital equipment procurement practices of these manufacturers have been, and continue to be, highly cyclical in nature, and have experienced both periodic
	and sustained downturns. For example, in the past, contractions in the credit markets have caused severe financial system disruptions that have contributed to a significant downturn in the electronics industry, which, in turn, impacted our revenues

	and other mobile connected devices or the increase in electronic content of automobiles during recent years may not continue at its current level, may not increase as
	anticipated and may decline. In addition, the IoT may not increase as anticipated and may decline. Furthermore, in recent years, we have enjoyed a strong, though indirect, position with a leading mobile designer and brand, which has been an
	important factor in our PCB and SD businesses. We cannot predict whether this position will continue or expand or whether the sales of such brand will continue at the current level or grow as anticipated. Should there occur negative or detrimental
	developments in connection with any of the above matters, our PCB and SD businesses may be adversely impacted. In addition, the need for higher definition, more power efficient, low cost FPDs may not increase as anticipated or even continue at
	current levels, and, as has occurred in the past, may decline, which would negatively affect our FPD business. Should cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected. Given our limited
	ability to reduce our significant expenditures for research and development and worldwide customer support operations and our need to maintain short lead times for delivery, our cost reduction measures may not be implemented in a sufficiently timely
	manner or may not be sufficient in response to industry cycles. Our inability to respond to industry cycles could, among other factors, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	warranty, avail themselves of various service and support alternatives pursuant to which we provide time and materials support, as well as opportunities to upgrade and/or refurbish existing modules. In periods of reduced capital expenditures, our
	service revenues represent a larger percentage of our revenues. A change in business conditions could alter current customer purchasing plans and, as a result, our maintenance agreements may not be renewed or our customers may elect not to purchase
	time and materials based service and support. We may therefore not generate significant revenues and cash flow from product maintenance in future periods, which would negatively impact our results of operations.

	The timing of revenue recognition for certain of our products and charges and amortization expenses incurred in connection with and as a result
	of acquisitions may have a substantial effect on our periodic revenues and financial results. Our revenues, expenses and operating results have fluctuated in the past, and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of
	factors, many of which are beyond our control. Normally, revenue from the sale of products is recognized upon delivery, subject to the existence of a signed contract, purchase order or letter of agreement and a fixed or determinable sale price, with
	reasonable assurance of collectability. We are not always able to control the timing of delivery because of customer requirements, possible production delays and other factors. Orders for our systems may also be subject to cancellation by customers.
	In addition, in limited circumstances, principally in the case of newly developed products, recognition of revenue may be deferred. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, and such fluctuations could be further exacerbated
	due to the timing of special charges and expenses. In 2014, for example, we recorded a
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	one-time
</FONT>
	charge of approximately $6.8&nbsp;million related to the SPTS Acquisition costs. In addition, from the SPTS
	Closing Date, our amortization of intangible assets increased due to the SPTS Acquisition, and we anticipate that such amortization will be approximately $25.5&nbsp;million in 2017. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly that of the
	United States dollar (the &#147;
<B>
	Dollar
</B>
	&#148; or &#147;
<B>
	$
</B>
	&#148;) relative to the currencies of other jurisdictions in which we operate, may also have a substantial effect on our periodic financial results. In 2016, our results were
	impacted by a strengthening Dollar relative to other currencies in which we conduct certain of our operations. For more information on the impact of currency fluctuations on our business and financial reporting, see Risk Factor (p). Accordingly, it
	may be difficult for investors to make

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, due to the SPTS Acquisition, it may be difficult to compare both our historical and future results to our results for the years
	2016, 2015 and 2014. The SPTS Acquisition was accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting, which resulted in new valuations for the assets and liabilities of SPTS to their fair values on August&nbsp;7, 2014. In addition, we incurred
	$300.0&nbsp;million of debt to finance a portion of the SPTS Acquisition, which resulted in increased interest expense compared with prior periods. This debt was repaid in full in June 2016 with the proceeds of the 2016 Offering and the Term Loan.
	Moreover, SPTS&#146;s results are included in our consolidated results of operations as of August&nbsp;7, 2014, and in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 our SD business represented approximately 34% and 35%, respectively, of our
	revenues. In addition, in 2015, we sold the Thermal Products Business and recorded a gain from that transaction. Accordingly, our financial information for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 may be of limited use in evaluating our
	current and historical performance and comparing it to prior periods.

	Certain of the various key components and subassemblies included in some of our systems are purchased from a single or limited
	group of suppliers. Should any of these suppliers be unable to meet our requirements in a timely manner, or should we otherwise experience an interruption in supply from any of these sources, the possible resulting late deliveries of our products
	and services may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. While we seek to anticipate future increases in demand for our products, and communicate potential increases in a timely manner to suppliers, we may be unable to do so with
	accuracy. If our suppliers are unable to deliver key components or subassemblies to meet our production needs, whether as a result of an unanticipated increase in demand for our products or otherwise, our production process may be delayed causing us
	to be unable to meet all of our customers&#146; desired delivery dates. Although we generally maintain an inventory of critical components used in the manufacture and assembly of our systems, such supplies may not be sufficient to avoid potential
	delays. In addition, were a major disruption (such as might be caused by factors including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters) to occur at our offices or manufacturing
	facilities, or those of our key suppliers, we could not guarantee that alternate production capacity would be obtainable on favorable terms or at all. Such disruptions could result in loss of customers and revenues and, as a result, could adversely
	affect our business by causing substantial delays in our research and engineering efforts for the development of new products.

	A sudden
	increase (or decrease) in demand for our products, as well as a lengthening (or shortening) of customer lead times, may also affect our manufacturing cycle and impose logistical constraints on our supply chain. In periods of greater demand for our
	products, we would be required to increase our production and delivery rate significantly. There can be no guarantee that we will, in the future, have the capacity necessary to ramp up production in order to meet increased orders without any delay.
	In addition, our manufacturing cycle involves significant fixed costs, including those with respect to labor. While we seek to maintain a variable cost structure across our supply chain infrastructure, cyclical fluctuations in demand for our
	products may result in periodic inefficiencies in our cost structure. Certain of our costs that are variable, such as procurement, may not decline proportionally with any increased purchasing of supplies by us, or may be increased beyond our
	expectations to meet customer timelines. While we have undertaken and expect to continue to implement initiatives to realign our infrastructure with revenue levels and business conditions, including initiatives to consolidate production facilities,
	expenses relating to the production, shipping and delivery of our products, which may involve facilities on more than one continent, remain a significant component of our overall cost of goods sold. Should we experience late deliveries of our
	products and services or be unsuccessful in implementing our infrastructure realignment or otherwise mitigating expenses associated with our global supply chain, our results of operations and reputation may be adversely affected.

	a substantial part of our revenues. In the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, approximately 79% of our revenues from equipment sales were derived from sales in the Far East and Japan, including approximately 35% from sales in China, 25% from sales
	in Taiwan, 7% from sales in Japan and 6% from sales in Korea. The risks and complexities inherent in doing business in international markets include those associated with the possibility of a concentration of sales within a particular country or

	The risks and complexities outlined above may also prove to be

	are influenced by many factors beyond our control, including current and future economic conditions, political uncertainty, unemployment rates, inflation, fluctuations in the level of disposable income, taxation, foreign exchange control, and
	changes in interest and currency exchange rates. The economy of China differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of governmental involvement, advantages of local partners, level of development,
	growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over the country&#146;s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign
	currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Our subsidiaries doing business in China are subject to laws, rules and regulations generally applicable to foreign
	entities operating in that country. Although certain Chinese legislation enacted over recent decades has significantly increased the protections afforded to various forms of foreign or private-sector investment in China, these laws and regulations
	are nevertheless still relatively new and the Chinese legal system, in which legal cases generally may be cited for reference but have limited value as precedents, continues to evolve rapidly. As a result, the interpretations of many laws,
	regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties.

	the Dollar remained within a narrow range. After June 2010, the Chinese government again allowed the RMB to appreciate slowly against the Dollar. On August&nbsp;11, 2015, however, the PBOC allowed the RMB to depreciate by approximately 2% against
	the Dollar. Changes in the value of the RMB against the Dollar may occur relatively suddenly as, for example, was the case in August 2015. It is difficult to predict how market forces or Chinese or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate

	As part of our

	diversify into adjacent industries. In addition, we evaluate other types of strategic initiatives to enhance value, such as corporate financing alternatives in the form of, among others, debt, equity and equity-linked capital raising.

	Risks associated with these activities include: assessing accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent, unexpected and other
	liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates; financing and ongoing debt service costs; the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business; the ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies and any cost
	savings, cross-selling and other benefits; difficulties in successfully integrating, operating, maintaining and managing newly acquired operations and personnel and customer retention; accounting and regulatory issues relating to the previous
	conduct of an acquired business; difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business; the possibility of impairment and
	restructuring charges if an acquired business performs below expectations; and the diversion of management attention from our existing business. In addition, such transactions often result in the acquisition of intangible assets required to be
	amortized in our consolidated statements of operations over certain time periods and the recording of goodwill which may be subject to possible future impairment charges. Such amounts have been, and may continue to be, substantial and have a
	material effect on our operating results. We may finance these strategic initiatives with debt, equity or equity-linked financings and such amounts and ongoing debt service and/or dilution may be significant. In addition, we may undertake
	stand-alone corporate financing activities, including debt, equity and equity-linked capital raising. For example, as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had $90.0&nbsp;million of debt outstanding under the Term Loan and $11.25&nbsp;million of
	availability under the RCF. Furthermore, because we are a &#145;well-known seasoned issuer&#146;, we have a higher degree of flexibility to access the capital markets; and on June&nbsp;9, 2016, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on

<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	operating risks we face. For more information about our existing indebtedness, see Item 5 - Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Liquidity and Capital Resources. Although we selectively pursue strategic opportunities, some or all of these
	transactions may not be announced in the foreseeable future, or at all, and they may not be consummated even following announcement. The costs incurred in evaluating and consummating strategic transactions could result in incurring expenses and
	losses even if any announced transaction may ultimately be beneficial. Furthermore, the emergence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired business previously unknown to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of

	Dollar relative to other currencies has the impact of reducing our costs incurred in those currencies thereby increasing our profitability. This can be partially offset by the impact on revenues that we earn in such currencies. Any positive impact
	of a strengthening Dollar on our local costs may be offset by hedging that we have undertaken. While hedging is designed to reduce our exposure to these effects, in times of high or unanticipated volatility, it may be insufficiently effective in
	hedging the impact, and may even exacerbate it. Hedging exposure in certain currencies, particularly the RMB, can be costly, which may limit our ability effectively to hedge our exposure to such currencies. We may, from time to time, take other

	We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel and our headquarters, as well as substantial research and development and production

	or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place
	between Israel and its Arab neighbors and a state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Beginning in September 2000, the overall relationship and security situation between Israel and
	the Palestinians deteriorated significantly and continues to be marked by ongoing violence, also varying in its degree of severity. During the winter of 2008-2009, the autumn of 2012 and the summer of 2014, Israel was engaged in armed conflicts with
	Hamas, a terrorist organization and political party operating in the Gaza Strip. These conflicts involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including in Yavne, where our headquarters and principal research and
	development and production facilities are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. In addition, since 2011, riots and uprisings in several countries in the Middle East and neighboring regions have led to severe political
	instability in several neighboring countries and to a decline in the regional security situation. Such instability may affect the local and global economy, could negatively affect business conditions and, therefore, could adversely affect our

	and it is possible that there will be additional recruitments in the future. No assessment can be made of the full impact of such matters on us in the future, particularly if emergency circumstances occur, or the effect on us of any expansion of
	these obligations. Our operations could be disrupted and harmed by the absence for a significant period of time of one or more of our key employees or a significant number of our other employees due to military service. To date, these matters have

	In June 2012, charges were filed in the Seoul Central District Court of
	the Republic of Korea (the &#147;

	Seoul Court
</B>
	&#148;) against the Korean subsidiary of Orbotech Ltd. and six employees thereof. These charges, as amended in September 2013, related to the alleged acquisition and misuse of confidential customer
	information in violation of the Korean Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology, the Korean Unfair Competition Prevention and Trade Secret Protection Act and the Criminal Code of Korea (the &#147;
<B>
	Korean
	Matter
</B>

	criminal fine of approximately $10,000. Following such acquittal, the prosecutor filed a notice of appeal with respect to all aspects of the decision issued by the Seoul Court. The prosecutor appealed the Seoul Court&#146;s decision with respect to
	all the defendants on the grounds that its decision contained errors of fact, errors of law and an unjust sentence. The employee of Orbotech Ltd.&#146;s Korean subsidiary who was found guilty of certain legal violations and who received a criminal
	fine also appealed the Seoul Court&#146;s decision issued in respect of him. In December 2014, the appellate panel of the Seoul Court denied all of the appeals and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	Our involvement in the Korean Matter has been and is expected to continue to be distracting to our corporate
	management and our technical personnel in Korea. Taking into account insurance participation, in each of 2016 and 2015 we recorded an annual expense of less than $25,000. We anticipate that we will continue to incur associated expenses throughout
	the appeal and investigation. The Korean Matter is expected to extend through 2017; however, the Company cannot predict with accuracy the timing or results of the Korean Matter. The investigation by the prosecutor into the actions of Orbotech and
	our employees outside of Korea is ongoing and the timing or outcome of such investigation cannot be predicted. Adverse outcomes in this litigation or investigation may result in monetary penalties against our Korean subsidiary of up to
	1.5&nbsp;billion Korean Won (approximately $1.3&nbsp;million at the exchange rate in effect on January&nbsp;31, 2017 of Korean Won 1,173 = $1.00), and in fines against its employees, which may also be paid by us under certain circumstances. We have
	not recorded a provision related to the Korean Matter and ongoing investigation as of the date of this Annual Report because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the financial impact of an adverse outcome in these matters. In addition,
	because the Korean Matter and investigation are ongoing, we and our employees could be subject to new criminal charges and additional monetary fines, and be subject to the imposition of changes in the way we conduct our business in Korea or
	elsewhere, which may make it more expensive for us to make, sell and service our products. This litigation negatively impacted FPD sales in Korea in the years 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, particularly to one of the large manufacturers located in that
	country. The Korean Matter and investigation have harmed our reputation and, although we have taken steps to review and implement improvements to our approach to safeguarding customer information, we may not be able fully to repair the damage with
	our customers.

	Our broad range of advanced and integrated inspection, test and repair technologies, applications insights

	and they, as well as possible future 8K technologies, may be expected to continue to drive, the need for yield-enhancement. This, coupled with increased inspection and testing, will require greater initial stage investment by manufacturers, thus
	creating a growth opportunity for which we are well-positioned. We estimate that in a typical FPD fabrication plant, costing between $2 and $5&nbsp;billion and taking about a year to construct, approximately 2.5% of the construction costs are

	Consumer products continue to include more functionality (such as speed, photographic resolution and data streaming, among other functions)
	packed into smaller volumes. The direction throughout the semiconductor industry is to continue to strive towards further miniaturization of the semiconductor devices used in these consumer products. New semiconductor device technologies and
	architectures in this field are also driven by a persistent impetus to lower costs. For example, since 2015

	Wafer Level Packaging (&#147;

	Another relatively new technology is plasma dicing. For manufacturers
	of very high volume small parts such as radio-frequency identification (RFIDs), plasma dicing offers up to 80% more die per wafer, thus enhancing productivity and avoiding the need for die shrink. Other customers are seeking to use the low damage
	nature of the plasma dicing process to reduce Si thickness and therefore package height. Both these trends are creating initial demand for our plasma dicing solutions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Similar demand for our solutions, in particular etch solutions, is created by the growing use of MEMS in products such as smartphones and
	automobiles. Certain newer devices (known a &#145;PiezoMEMS&#146;) that are considered superior to traditional capacitance MEMS require deposition of a special material (for instance, aluminium nitride) during their manufacture, which is achieved
	using PVD systems.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The high growth rate of RF devices is driven by smartphone growth and use of multiple frequencies, as well as by the

	Virtually all electronic equipment uses PCBs, which are the basic
	interconnect platforms for the electronic components that comprise all electronic equipment. PCBs contain the electronic circuitry required to interconnect the components which are subsequently mounted on them and which, when operating together,
	perform a specified function. An assembly of one or more mounted PCBs working together forms an essential part of most electronic products. These include computers, hand-held electronic devices such as mobile phones, tablets and electronic book
	readers, wearable devices, consumer electronics, automotive equipment, telecommunications equipment, industrial and medical equipment and military and aerospace applications.

	PCBs are manufactured through a series of complex steps. Generally, production starts with a sheet of epoxy-fiberglass (or other material with
	electric insulating qualities) laminated with a conducting material such as copper. The sheet is coated with a thin layer of light-sensitive material (&#145;photoresist&#146;). A transparent film containing the desired circuitry pattern
	(&#145;production phototool&#146;), normally produced by a photoplotter connected to a CAD/CAM database, is then laid on the photoresist. The sheet is then exposed to light, which copies the conductor pattern from the production phototool on to the
	photoresist. Alternatively, the conductor pattern may be transferred directly on to the photoresist without the use of a production phototool using direct imaging technologies. Subsequent development of the photoresist and a chemical etching process
	removes excess conducting material and leaves the desired conducting metal pattern printed on the layer.

	Although PCBs may be
	single-sided or double-sided, the largest segment of the PCB industry consists of multilayer boards. In multilayer board production several such layers with appropriate copper patterns (&#145;inner layers&#146;) are stacked up in registration and
	laminated together. Thereafter, holes are drilled through the stack in a specific pattern, using a mechanical or laser driller, and plated with a conductive metal. Further steps of patterning the outermost layers, protecting the functional areas
	with a more inert conductor and the rest of the surface with insulating material (&#145;solder mask&#146;) and marking the board with a screen printed or ink jetted legend result in the completed multilayer board. Still more advanced PCBs, known as
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	&#145;build-up&#146;
</FONT>
	boards, are produced using high density interconnect (&#147;
<B>
	HDI
</B>
	&#148;) technology. This involves adding thin additional electrical insulating layers to the top and bottom surface of the
	board, drilling miniature vias through each such layer using a laser drilling machine and then metalizing and patterning the surface as before. This process may be repeated several times resulting in multiple build up layers on each side of the PCB.

	Semiconductors are useful because their electronic and photonic behavior can

	devices at high levels of integration using semiconductor wafers. The most common material used in semiconductor manufacturing is silicon. Furthermore, modern technology is able to integrate such miniaturized electronics with miniaturized mechanical

	Our
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	PCB-AOI
</FONT>
	products are of particular value to manufacturers of fine-line, advanced PCBs (where
	defects are especially difficult to detect) and of multilayered PCBs (where the cost of undetected defects is very high) because they enable manufacturers to trace the source of defects in their manufacturing processes and increase their yield of
	usable finished products. Our
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	PCB-AOS
</FONT>
	products are capable of repairing PCBs by removing excess copper from places that cannot be accessed by the use of a scalpel or other manual instrument, such as shorts on
	materials that are too thin to be treated by scalpel repair or in spaces between lines that are virtually invisible to the human eye. In 2016, we introduced the Precise 800, AOS system, which offers a three-dimensional copper shaping function
	capable of adding copper in defects such as opens during PCB fabrication. This complements the Company&#146;s excess copper extraction offerings, thus creating a full suite of AOS yield improvement solutions. In addition, the capability of our
	digital production solutions, such as DI, digital printing and UV laser drilling, to adapt production data and thereby compensate for random production process inaccuracies enables manufacturers to improve their yield in the production of these
	complex boards. Our
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	pre-production
</FONT>
	software solutions improve the speed and accuracy of the PCB engineering process, optimize production processes, improve production data/tools and reduce the cost of
	manufacturing, all by utilizing

	design to manufacturing software algorithms and electronic rules. Our products
	for additional adjacent advanced electronics manufacturing essentially perform similar functions as our AOI, AOS, DI, digital printing and CAM products, but on different materials and for different applications.

	In the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, our PCB product lines, including those for additional adjacent electronics component manufacturing,
	accounted for approximately $286.9&nbsp;million of revenues (including approximately $116.6&nbsp;million related to service and support of those products), representing approximately 35.5% of our revenues. This compared with approximately
	$255.5&nbsp;million of revenues (including approximately $114.4&nbsp;million related to service and support of those products), representing approximately 34% of our revenues, in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, and approximately
	$286.2&nbsp;million of revenues (including approximately $115.2&nbsp;million related to service and support of those products), representing approximately 49% of our revenues, in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	AOS systems are designed to address certain limitations inherent in the manual repair of PCBs, by enabling the automatic shaping of defects in
	PCB production, such as excess copper (known as &#145;shorts&#146;) and missing copper (known as &#145;opens&#146;), thereby minimizing the scrapping of unusable panels during the manufacturing process and enabling a significant reduction in
	manufacturers&#146; overall manufacturing costs. Our AOS products employ advanced image acquisition and image processing techniques, combined with high-performance laser control, to ablate the excess conductor material, or add copper where missing,
	thereby achieving highly accurate, repeatable and reliable results, particularly for advanced PCB applications, which cannot be replicated in manual repair processes. The AOS PerFix series, which was the first system to offer an automated shaping
	solution for shorts, was complemented in 2016 by the introduction of the Precise 800 which offers the capability of depositing additional copper to shape open defects in PCBs. This powerful combination of solutions for both shorts and opens without
	manual intervention, offers substantial added value to customers, enabling them to increase production yields without sacrificing manufacturing quality standards.

	higher solar energy to electricity conversion efficiencies and, in turn, reducing the cost per watt of electricity produced by photovoltaic systems. The system which was developed by OLTS combines the benefits of high efficiency performance of
	direct PECVD and the productivity of high throughput operation. In addition, PECVD is currently being developed for the deposition of thin films for solar efficiency improvement, such as

	To improve understanding of the Financial Statements, it is important to obtain some degree of familiarity with the Company&#146;s principal or
	significant accounting policies. These policies are described in Note 1 to the Financial Statements. The Company reviews its financial reporting, disclosure practices and accounting policies at least annually to ensure that the Financial Statements,
	which are developed on the basis of these accounting policies, provide in all material respects complete, accurate and transparent information concerning the financial position and results of operations of the Company. As part of this process, the
	Company has reviewed the selection and application of its critical accounting

	policies and financial disclosures and it believes that the Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of

	In preparing the Financial Statements in accordance with
	U.S. GAAP, the Company&#146;s management must often make judgments, estimates and assumptions, which may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures as at the date of the Financial Statements and
	during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results may differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. In the current economic environment, the risks and uncertainties
	associated with those estimates and assumptions are exacerbated. For any given individual estimate or assumption made by the Company, there may be alternative estimates or assumptions that are also reasonable. However, the Company believes that,
	given the facts and circumstances before it at the time of making the relevant judgments, estimates or assumptions, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable approach would cause a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
	consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in the Financial Statements.

	The Company is

	strength of product and service offerings by the Company and its competitors, changes in business or pricing strategies, changes in the prevailing political and regulatory framework in which the relevant parties operate or in economic or
	technological trends or conditions, including currency fluctuations, inflation and consumer confidence, on a global, regional or national basis. Certain of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions are discussed under the heading Cautionary

	products to end users upon delivery, provided
	that appropriate signed documentation of the arrangement, such as a signed contract, purchase order or letter of agreement has been received by the Company, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. If the Company

	The determination of ESP involves consideration of several factors based on the specific facts
	and circumstances of the arrangement. Specifically, the Company evaluates the cost to produce the deliverable, the anticipated margin on that deliverable, the selling price and profit margin for similar parts in different geographical regions, its
	ongoing pricing strategy and policies and other economic conditions and trends.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This accounting treatment is applied if the delivered
	elements have value on a stand-alone basis, the arrangement does not include a general right of return with respect to delivered items and delivery or performance of undelivered items is considered probable and is substantially within the
	Company&#146;s control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Installation and training are not considered essential to the product capabilities since they do not require specialized skills and can be
	performed by other vendors. Accordingly, upon delivery, the Company defers revenue in an amount equivalent to the fair value of installation and training and recognizes those deferred revenues once installation and training has been completed.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s revenue arrangements contain multiple elements, as it grants its customers installation services and, on some of its
	products, a warranty on products sold, which includes the provision of post-sale service and maintenance, usually for a period of six to 12 months. Upon meeting the revenue recognition criteria of the product, the Company records a portion of the
	sale price that relates to the fair value of the services and maintenance expected to be performed during the aforementioned period as deferred income, and recognizes it as service revenue ratably over such period. The cost to the Company of
	warranting that the product will perform according to certain specifications and that the Company will repair or replace the product if it ceases to work properly is insignificant and is treated according to accounting principles for contingencies.
	After the warranty period, service revenue in respect of the Company&#146;s systems is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as services are performed. Annual service fees are generally based on the list price of the Company&#146;s
	products. It has been the Company&#146;s experience that many of its customers elect to receive maintenance services from the Company on a continuing contractual basis after the conclusion of the warranty period.

	conditions. However, unexpected favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results and gross profit if inventory that has been written down is sold for more than its carrying value. Determinations of
	future demand for the Company&#146;s products are based on the estimates included in the Company&#146;s multi-year plans. The Company&#146;s historical experience has been that its estimates of future demand have been reasonably reliable. Monitoring
	and administration of inventory is an important area of management focus, given the need to balance, on the one hand, the requirement to maintain prudent inventory levels as part of the Company&#146;s efforts to assure competitive product delivery
	lead times, with the risk of inventory obsolescence, on the other.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers for the purpose of determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful
	accounts. In respect of sales to customers in certain countries, the Company generally requires letters of credit from banks. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined for specific debts the collection of which is doubtful. While the Company
	believes that its valuations are appropriate, in times of adverse and unstable economic conditions, the Company&#146;s credit evaluations may not be accurate or may be based on historical information that does not adequately reflect the severity of
	the economic downturn. These factors could lead to collection of accounts receivable at lower rates than in the past or than have been reserved.

	The Company&#146;s long-lived assets are comprised of goodwill, acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. The

	estimated useful life of such intangible assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets (or asset group) may not be recoverable. These indicators may
	include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used.

	Taxes on income

	assumptions as to the Company&#146;s entitlement to various benefits under the applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The entitlement to such benefits depends upon the Company&#146;s compliance with the terms and conditions

	Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on the changes in the deferred tax asset or liability from period to period. Valuation

	recording a valuation allowance, and will refrain from recording a valuation allowance if the former outweigh the latter. In the event that the tax assets are not realized, income tax expense would increase or, conversely, if the valuation allowance
	is overestimated, the Company would benefit from a future tax credit.

	The goodwill impairment

	The first step involves comparing the fair value of a company&#146;s reporting units to their carrying amount. If the fair value of the
	reporting unit is determined to be greater than its carrying amount, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit&#146;s carrying amount is determined to be greater than the fair value, the second step must be completed to measure the amount of
	impairment, if any. Step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step
	one. The implied fair value of the goodwill in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment loss equivalent to the difference is

	During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, revenues from product
	sales in China continued to increase, reflecting ongoing capital expenditures during the year by PCB, FPD and SD manufacturers. The decrease in revenues in Europe reflects a trend on the part of European manufacturers towards shifting their
	facilities to Asia.

	During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, revenues from product sales in Taiwan increased sharply, due mainly to
	increased demand for SD products for the RF and Advanced Packaging sectors, but also as a result of increased investments by FPD manufacturers. The increase in revenues generated in North America and, particularly, Europe is a reflection of the full
	year contribution of SPTS.

	During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, revenues from product sales in China increased as compared with
	the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, as a result of the continued capital expenditures during the year by FPD manufacturers in that country. The approximately 10% increase in the proportion of revenues generated outside Asia reflects the impact of
	the SPTS Acquisition on the Company&#146;s geographical diversification.

	The Company&#146;s ability to foresee future changes in the
	total volume of orders for its products and services remains limited, particularly, but not only, with respect to its PCB products. The inherent uncertainties associated with the global economic environment and the financial markets and economies of
	those countries in which the Company markets its products, together with the related possible changes in demand for its products, means that past operating results may not necessarily be indicative of the future. See Trend Information.

	the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 was 17% (16% excluding the effect of the charges associated with the retirement of the JPMorgan Credit Agreement) due to the combination of the factors described below.

	The Company elected the
	alternative benefits route under the Investment Law with respect to its Approved Enterprises. Under this route the Company waived government grants in return for a tax exemption on undistributed income. Due to the geographic location of the
	Company&#146;s facilities, such tax exemption on undistributed income applied for a limited period of two years. In the event that such tax exempt income is distributed as a dividend or a deemed dividend, the Company will be required to pay the
	applicable corporate tax that would otherwise have been payable on such income. During the remainder of the applicable benefits period, a corporate tax rate not exceeding 25% applied. The Company&#146;s entitlement to such benefits was conditioned
	upon its compliance with the terms and conditions prescribed in the Investment Law. During 2013, the benefits period applicable to the last of the Company&#146;s Approved Enterprises expired.

	Additional amendments to the Investment Law became effective in January 2011 and were further amended in August 2013 (the &#147;
<B>
	2011
	Amendment
</B>
	&#148;). Under the 2011 Amendment, income derived by &#145;Preferred Companies&#146; from &#145;Preferred Enterprises&#146; (both as defined in the 2011 Amendment) would be subject to a uniform rate of corporate tax for an unlimited
	period as opposed to the incentives prior to the 2011 Amendment that were limited to income from Approved or Benefiting Enterprises during their benefits period. According to the 2011 Amendment, the tax rate applicable to such income, referred to as
	&#145;Preferred Income&#146;, would be 10% in areas in Israel that are designated as Development Zone A and 15% elsewhere in Israel during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2012, 7% and 12.5%, respectively, in the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2013, 9% and 16%, until the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, and 7.5% and 16%, respectively, from 2017 and thereafter. Income derived by a Preferred Company from a &#145;Special Preferred Enterprise&#146; (as defined in the
	Investment Law) would enjoy further reduced income tax rates for a period of ten years of 5% in Development Zone A and 8% elsewhere. As of January&nbsp;1, 2014, dividends distributed from Preferred Income would subject the recipient to a 20% tax (or
	lower, if so provided under an applicable tax treaty), which would generally be withheld at source by the distributing company, provided, however, that dividends distributed from &#145;Preferred Income&#146; from one Israeli corporation to another,
	would not be subject to tax. Under the transitional provisions of the 2011 Amendment, companies may elect to irrevocably implement the 2011 Amendment with respect to their existing Approved and Benefiting Enterprises while waiving benefits provided

	Because the Company&#146;s results are reported in Dollars, changes in the rate of exchange between the Dollar and local currencies in those
	countries in which the Company operates (primarily the NIS, the GBP, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the RMB and the Taiwanese dollar) will affect the Company&#146;s results of operations. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, on a comparative
	annual average basis as against the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the main currencies relevant to the Company&#146;s operations strengthened (weakened) against the Dollar, as follows: the NIS by 1.2%, the GBP by (11.3)%, the Japanese Yen by
	10.1%, the RMB by (6.6)%, the Euro by (0.3)% and the Taiwanese dollar by (1.5)%. In general, because the Company incurs costs in each of these jurisdictions, a decrease in the value of the local currency against the Dollar tends to have a positive
	effect on the Company&#146;s profitability, though this can be partially offset by the impact on revenues that the Company earns in such currencies.

	The Company&#146;s business, comprised of its PCB, FPD and SD businesses, provides it with a robust and diversified position in the electronics
	industry. Industry conditions affecting the Company&#146;s business in 2017 are expected to remain strong, and consistent with, or slightly better than in, 2016. The Company expects that the second half of 2017 will be stronger than the first half,
	reflecting a corresponding trend in the industries which it serves. The ongoing, increasing complexity of electronic devices, together with favorable industry dynamics as discussed below, is expected to continue to drive demand for the
	Company&#146;s yield-enhancing and process-enabling solutions for the manufacture of electronics products. Favorable industry dynamics include the continued innovation in smart mobile devices, the continued usage of electronics in automobiles,
	increased 4G adoption worldwide and the initial build up of 5G infrastructure for mobile telecommunications in China, demand for wearable solutions, increased interconnectedness of devices as reflected in the IoT, the growth of high definition,
	large screen televisions, OLED and flexible display technologies along with the overall increased complexity and small size of devices with less energy consumption. The Company&#146;s product diversification, against the background of these industry
	dynamics, lends confidence to Orbotech&#146;s belief that it is well positioned to achieve growth in each of its three primary divisions in 2017. Nevertheless, conditions in the electronics industry are tied to the overall economic climate and
	uncertainty currently exists in connection with the stability of growth in China, the impact of Brexit and the administration change in the United States. In addition, the Company is exposed to cyclicality in a number of industries, including the
	automotive industry. Downturns in these industries could also have a negative impact on the Company&#146;s results.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The key factors in
	the growth potential of the PCB industry in 2017 are innovation in smart mobile devices, the proliferation of electronics within automobiles and new PCB production technologies. In 2016, Orbotech maintained its leadership position in established
	production technologies through its existing products, and introduced new solutions to support more complex and demanding PCB production needs. In addition to the foregoing, Orbotech also expects investment in the infrastructure for 4G mobile
	telecommunications, particularly in China, emerging wearable devices and flexible devices to drive growth in PCB. The Company has focused on
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	high-end
</FONT>
	segment PCBs, which should position it well to capitalize
	on opportunities in the PCB industry by continuing to enable it to provide critical production solutions designed to meet increasing production challenges. The Company&#146;s PCB business remains driven by demand for its yield-enhancing and
	process-enabling solutions, including its technologically advanced direct imaging, AOI and AOS products and inkjet printing, some of which are critical in the mass production of HDI and flex PCBs and packaging solutions for IC substrates. Sales are
	expected to be more technology, as opposed to expansion, driven. Based on these and the other factors described above, the Company anticipates an improvement in its PCB business in 2017, as compared with 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company expects growth in its FPD business in 2017, as compared with 2016, and anticipates that this will be driven by improved demand for
	large size televisions (greater than 55 inches) and OLED in the coming years. China&#146;s stated objective of meeting all local demand for LCDs in China is continuing to drive capital investment in that country. In addition, the Company expects
	that growth in 2017 will be driven by momentum in 4K televisions and high resolution smartphones. The need for additional product lines to meet capacity requirements for those products, combined with the introduction of new display technologies,
	will lead to increased opportunities for the Company&#146;s equipment to perform an even greater role in FPD manufacturing. In addition, manufacturers continue to invest, and to announce planned future investments, in active matrix OLED flexible
	display technologies. To meet the demand driven by these trends, the Company offers a number of solutions focused on ultra-high resolution and high throughput. These advanced inline and offline inspection and testing solutions are designed to enable
	Generation 10.5 fabrication facilities and advanced Generation 8.x fabrication facilities to achieve efficiencies that will further improve panel quality. The Company has also engaged with industry partners on multiple process innovation projects to
	address production challenges in flexible display manufacturing. Based on these developments, as well as existing orders and a strong wave of expected investments in 2017, principally in the latter part of the year and into 2018, the Company
	anticipates further growth in its FPD business in 2017, as compared with 2016.

	The segments of the semiconductor industry relevant to the Company are poised for growth in 2017,
	as increasing consumer demand for high product functionality in various industries is expected to drive demand for RF, Power, and MEMS devices, as well as the adoption of new integration schemes in Advanced Packaging. Advanced Packaging is a growing
	segment that creates more opportunities for the Company&#146;s products and solutions. Specifically, FOWLP growth continues to move at a fast adoption pace, in line with many industry analysts considering it to be the fastest growing advanced
	packaging technology in the semiconductor industry. The demand for thinner devices and the growth of the IoT has created greater and more immediate need for cost-effective, high density products. In 2016, the Company established a leadership
	position in PVD systems for FOWLP, which it expects to maintain in 2017. In addition, the Company offered new solutions for plasma dicing, specifically the Mosaic Rapier-300S, and is well-positioned to take advantage of this emerging technology. In
	2016, RF experienced growth as a result of increased demand for filters being driven by 3G, 4G and 5G

	mobile telecommunications products. The Company occupies a strong position in MEMS, which is
	expected to continue to provide revenues in 2017 as new capacity is installed for the coming generation of smartphones, automotive and biomedical sectors. Devices such as microphones and sensors (including fingerprint sensors), LIDAR, RADAR and
	acoustic sensors on automotive platforms being pushed by auto-collision avoidance systems as well as automated driver assistance initiatives, piezoelectric MEMs devices and IoT. Overall, based on these factors, the Company anticipates revenues from
	its SD business in 2017 will exceed those recorded for 2016.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company&#146;s backlog, the large majority
	of which consisted of orders for its FPD products, totaled approximately $156.4&nbsp;million. Visibility with respect to the Company&#146;s PCB business is lower than with respect to its FPD and SD businesses; and with respect to its SD business is
	lower than with respect to its FPD business. Although orders on any particular date are not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period, since customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, the
	Company believes it is well positioned to capitalize on existing and future opportunities as manufacturers make investments in capital equipment to meet heightened production challenges in a yield-focused environment. However, the Company is exposed
	to the risks and complexities inherent in doing business in international markets, some of which, such as those associated with the effective regulation and protection of intellectual property rights, are particularly acute in China. In addition,
	the Company faces continuing pricing pressure, including in China, as a result of competition from local manufacturers of PCB and FPD inspection equipment, and from Japanese and Korean manufacturers. The Company&#146;s geographic and product
	diversity improved its overall business position in 2016, and is expected to continue to do so in 2017.

	The Company expects that
	fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will continue to impact both its revenues and profitability. For example, the Company anticipates that the impact of the Brexit process will primarily be on the value of the GBP relative to the Dollar
	(the Company incurs costs, principally in its SD business, denominated in GBP); however, Brexit is an unprecedented and still unfolding event, making it impossible to predict what its consequences may be. In addition, the recent administration
	change in the United States could lead to increased volatility in the value of the Dollar relative to other currencies in which the Company incurs costs.

	Operating lease obligations represent commitments under various commercial facility and vehicle leases.

	approximately $7.6&nbsp;million was classified as long-term liabilities and approximately $7.4&nbsp;million was classified as short-term liabilities. Payment of these amounts would result from settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the

	The Companies Law requires public companies to appoint a remuneration committee comprised of at least three directors. The remuneration
	committee must include all of the external directors, one of whom shall serve as the chairman of the committee, and may not include certain directors. All other members of the committee, who are not external directors, must be directors who receive
	compensation that is in compliance with the Companies Law and the Compensation Regulations. Generally, any person who is not entitled to be a member of the remuneration committee may not attend the remuneration committee&#146;s meetings. Certain
	companies whose shares are traded on specified U.S. stock exchanges may elect to opt out of these composition requirements; however, after considering this matter, the Company has decided not to elect to opt out of any such requirements at this time

	contributions to a pension fund, insurance for loss of ability to work, procedures for dismissing employees, determination of severance pay, annual and other vacations, sick pay and other conditions of employment. The Company generally provides its

	In June 2012, charges were filed in the Seoul Central District Court of the Republic of Korea (the &#147;
<B>
	Seoul Court
</B>
	&#148;) against the
	Korean subsidiary of Orbotech Ltd. and six employees thereof. These charges, as amended in September 2013, related to the alleged acquisition and misuse of confidential information of certain of the Company&#146;s significant customers in violation
	of the Korean Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology, the Korean Unfair Competition Prevention and Trade Secret Protection Act and the Criminal Code of Korea. The charges included (1)&nbsp;the unlawful acquisition of
	certain industrial trade secrets related to the production of active matrix OLED panels of Samsung Mobile Display Co., Ltd. and LG Display Co. Ltd., customers of the Company&#146;s Korean subsidiary (the &#147;
<B>
	Customer
</B>
<B>
	Technology
</B>
	&#148;), (2) unlawful use of the Customer Technology by preparing certain presentation materials, (3)&nbsp;unlawful divulgence of the Customer Technology to other employees of the Company inside and outside of Korea, (4)&nbsp;breach
	of trust in office by acquiring and divulging the Customer Technology without the customer&#146;s permission for financial gain, and (5)&nbsp;the Korean subsidiary&#146;s vicarious liability for the conduct of its employees. In December 2013,
	Orbotech Ltd.&#146;s Korean subsidiary and five of its Korean employees were acquitted by the above court on all charges, and one Korean employee was found guilty of certain legal violations and received a criminal fine of approximately $10,000.
	Following such acquittal, the prosecutor filed a notice of appeal with respect to all aspects of the decision issued by the court. The prosecutor appealed the court&#146;s decision with respect to all the defendants on the grounds that the
	court&#146;s decision contained errors of fact, errors of law and an unjust sentence. The employee of Orbotech&#146;s Korean subsidiary who was found guilty of certain legal violations and who received a criminal fine also appealed the court&#146;s
	decision issued in respect of him. In December 2014, the appellate panel of the Seoul Court denied all appeals and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	re-affirmed
</FONT>
	the trial court&#146;s decision. Following this decision, a notice of appeal was
	filed by the prosecutor with respect to all aspects of the decision and with respect to all defendants. The Company&#146;s Korean subsidiary and its employees did not appeal the appellate panel&#146;s decision. The case is currently pending before
	the Supreme Court of Korea. Given the ongoing nature of these appeals, Orbotech cannot predict the timing, outcome or impact of this matter. In addition, the investigation by the prosecutor into the Company and the actions of employees of the
	Company outside of Korea is ongoing. The fiscal effect of these matters on the Company in 2016 has not been material. Taking into account insurance participation, the Company recorded an annual expense of less than $25,000 in each of 2016 and 2015,
	and an expense of $0.5&nbsp;million in 2014, in connection with the ongoing Korean litigation, which are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and expects to continue to incur fees and expenses associated therewith. The Korean
	Matter is expected to continue through 2017; however, it could extend beyond that time frame as a result of many factors that are outside the Company&#146;s control and the Company cannot predict with accuracy its timing or results. A portion of the
	costs have been or are expected to be reimbursed under the Company&#146;s applicable

	with the Korean authorities in this matter. Because this is an ongoing
	matter, the Company is unable to predict the outcome or what additional actions, if any, might be taken in the future by the Korean authorities as a result of matters related to this proceeding, and the timing and amount of costs associated with the
	existing and any future matters. However, the applicable Korean laws provide that fines of up to 1.5&nbsp;billion Korean Won (at the exchange rate on January&nbsp;31, 2017 of Korean Won 1,173 = $1.00, approximately U.S. $1.3 million) may be levied
	on employers based on vicarious liability for convicted employees. Employees may also be subject to monetary penalties in addition to, or in lieu of, prison sentences. These amounts may be paid by the Company under certain circumstances. The Company
	has not recorded a provision related to the Korean Matter and ongoing investigation as of the date of this Annual Report because the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the financial impact of an adverse outcome in these matters. The
	Company and its Korean subsidiary may also become subject to civil actions brought by third parties, including the Company&#146;s customers, which may result in monetary judgments, settlements or loss of business or which may require the Company to

	One of the
	Company&#146;s AOI products was the subject of patent infringement litigation in China. In this case, one of the Company&#146;s competitors in China copied certain of the Company&#146;s technologies and PCB AOI systems and proceeded to register
	utility model patents in China on certain components thereof. This competitor subsequently filed a lawsuit in the relevant jurisdiction in China against one of the Company&#146;s Chinese customers claiming that some of the Company&#146;s PCB AOI
	systems being used by the customer infringe upon one of these utility model patents. During 2013, the court of first instance ruled in favor of the competitor, which decision was appealed by Orbotech&#146;s customer. In December 2015, the appeal
	court confirmed the lower court&#146;s decision and ordered the customer to cease its infringing actions. The customer did not appeal this decision to the Supreme Court and this decision is now final. In addition, the Company&#146;s motion with the
	Chinese State Intellectual Property Office to invalidate the relevant utility model patent was denied during 2016. The Company has replaced the infringing component in the customer&#146;s system with a component that was designed to be
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-infringing

	The Company has filed lawsuits against two Chinese customers of this competitor in the Shenzhen Longgang District People&#146;s Court, in
	Guangdong Province, China, claiming infringement of the Company&#146;s copyright by using software copied from the Company for operating PCB AOI systems purchased by these customers from the competitor. During November 2015, the Court ruled in favor
	of the Company by confirming the infringement and ordering the two customers to cease the infringing action and to cover appraisal costs. These customers filed an appeal with the Shenzhen Intermediate Court and a hearing was held in June 2016. The
	parties are currently awaiting the appeal court&#146;s decision. Although the Company believes there are meritorious claims in this proceeding, it is unable to predict the timing, scope, cost and/or outcome thereof.

	the company&#146;s possession related to the proposed transaction. However, the company may prohibit a shareholder from reviewing the documents if the company believes the request was made in bad faith, the documents include trade secrets or patents

	otherwise interested, or with any company which is a shareholder of, or otherwise interested in, the Company, or from contracting with the Company either as vendor, purchaser or otherwise, either on his or her own behalf or as a director of another

	Holder&#146;s holding that office or of the fiduciary relations thereby established. An Office Holder who knows that he or she has, directly or indirectly, a personal interest in any existing or contemplated contract or arrangement of the Company of
	the type described in Article 73(a) shall disclose to the Company the nature of this interest, as well as any material fact or document, without delay and no later than the meeting of the Board at which such contract or arrangement is first

	against the transaction must not represent more than two percent of the voting rights in the company. The Israeli Minister of Justice may determine a different percentage. Transactions that are for a period of more than three years generally need to
	be brought for approval in accordance with the above procedure every three years.

	Similarly, unless an Israeli court determines otherwise, a merger will not be approved if it is objected to by shareholders holding a majority of the voting rights participating and voting at the meeting (abstentions are disregarded), after
	excluding the shares held by the other party to the merger, by any person who holds 25% or more of the other party to the merger or by anyone on their behalf, including by the relatives of or corporations controlled by these persons. In addition,
	upon the request of a creditor of either party to the proposed merger, an Israeli court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there exists a reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the surviving company will be unable to
	satisfy the obligations of any of the parties to the merger. Further, a merger can be completed only after all approvals have been submitted to the Registrar and 30 days have passed from the time that shareholder resolutions were adopted in each of
	the merging companies and 50 days have passed from the time that a proposal for approval of the merger was filed with the Registrar.

	25%. However, pursuant to the Investment Law, dividends distributed by an Israeli company and derived from income eligible for benefits under the Investment Law will generally be subject to a reduced dividend withholding tax rate, as detailed above,
	subject to the conditions specified in the Treaty. The Treaty further provides that Israeli withholding tax at the rate of 15% or 12.5% will apply to dividends paid to a U.S. corporation owning 10% or more of an Israeli company&#146;s voting shares
	during, in general, the current and preceding tax year of the Israeli company. The 15% rate applies to dividends distributed from income derived from an Approved Enterprise or, presumably, from a Benefiting Enterprise, in each case within the
	applicable period or, presumably, from a Preferred Enterprise, and the lower 12.5% rate applies to dividends distributed from income derived from other sources. However, these provisions do not apply if the company has more than certain amounts of

	to hold its proportionate share of the assets and receive its proportionate share of the income of any corporation in which it owns directly or indirectly at least 25% by value of the stock. The Company believes that it is not and has not been a

	The Company uses financial instruments and derivatives in order to limit its exposure to risks arising from changes in exchange rates. The use
	of such instruments does not expose the Company to additional exchange rate risks since the derivatives are held against an asset (for example, excess assets in Euros).

	The Company&#146;s derivative transactions in 2016 were executed through Israeli and international banks. The Company is exposed to
	counterparty risk arising from certain of its financial instruments and derivative contracts and it could be adversely affected by the soundness of counterparties, which include customers, suppliers and financial institutions. The Company uses
	derivatives to hedge certain exchange rate risk by entering into exchange rate-based derivative instruments with financial institution counterparties, such as broker/dealers, commercial banks and investment banks. These transactions are typically
	entered into on an unsecured basis and should the counterparty fail to honor its obligations under the relevant agreements, the Company could sustain losses which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of
	operations.

	Since the Company&#146;s functional currency and that of virtually all of its subsidiaries is the Dollar, the Company, including through its
	subsidiaries, protects itself against exposure arising from the difference between assets and liabilities in each currency other than the Dollar (&#147;
<B>
	Balance Sheet Exposure
</B>
	&#148;). The majority of the Balance Sheet Exposure is in Japanese
	Yen, GBP, Euros, RMB, the Taiwanese dollar and the NIS.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company endeavors to limit its Balance Sheet Exposure through
	&#145;natural&#146; hedging, i.e., by attempting to match its
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-Dollar
</FONT>
	denominated assets and liabilities in any given currency. The currency exposure that is not able to be managed through the matching of
	assets and liabilities is partially hedged through the use of derivative instruments; however, hedging exposures in certain currencies, particularly the RMB, can be costly, which may limit the Company&#146;s ability effectively to hedge its exposure
	to such currencies. To the extent possible, the Company engages in its exchange rate hedging on a consolidated basis. The Company is not able to use the matching of assets and financial derivatives to hedge all of its foreign currency exposure. In
	addition, the Company&#146;s activities in this area may not be effective, particularly in times of heightened currency volatility. Accordingly, there remains an inherent risk in the Company&#146;s business related to foreign currency exposure.

	As described in Item 10 &#045; Additional Information &#045; Memorandum and Articles of
	Association &#045; Shareholders&#146; Meetings, if a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time stated for an adjourned general meeting of shareholders of the Company, any shareholders present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall
	constitute a quorum, consistent with Israeli law. As such, the quorum requirements for an adjourned meeting are different from the Nasdaq requirement that an issuer listed on Nasdaq have a quorum requirement that in no case be less than 33 1/3% of
	the outstanding shares of the company&#146;s common voting stock.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Companies Law, Orbotech Ltd. may not be required to obtain
	shareholder approval for certain issuances of shares in excess of 20% of the outstanding shares of the Company, as would be required in certain circumstances by the Nasdaq listing standards. At this time, the Company does not have any intention to
	enter into any such transaction; however, it may in the future do so and opt to comply with the Companies Law, which may not require shareholder approval. Any such determination to follow the Companies Law requirements rather than the standards
	applicable to U.S. companies listed on Nasdaq will be made by the Company at the time in light of then-current circumstances.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the
	Companies Law, Orbotech Ltd. may not be required to obtain shareholder approval for equity-based compensation plans, as would be required by the Nasdaq listing standards. While in recent years the Company has generally brought its equity-based
	compensation plans to its shareholders for approval, it may, in the future, opt to follow Israeli legal requirements, which may not require shareholder approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, under the Companies Law, Orbotech Ltd. is not required to have an independent nominating committee, nor is there a requirement
	that its independent directors select (or recommend for selection) director nominees, as would be required by the Nasdaq listing standards for a U.S. domestic issuer. While the composition of the Company&#146;s Nominating Committee currently
	complies with Nasdaq listing standards, the Company may in the future opt to appoint members to its Nominating Committee who are not &#145;independent directors&#146; in accordance with Nasdaq listing standards, as is permitted under the Articles
	and the Companies Law or not to maintain a nominating committee at all, such that the functions of such committee would be performed by the full Board, a practice which is compliant with Israeli law. See Item 6 &#045; Directors, Senior Management
	and Employees.

	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,
	changes in equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Orbotech Ltd. (the &#147;
<B>
	Company
</B>
	&#148;) and its subsidiaries at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and
	their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
	respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, based on criteria established in
<I>
	Internal Control - Integrated Framework
</I>
	(2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
	Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s management and Board of Directors are responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
	internal control over financial reporting, included in &#147;Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting&#148; appearing under Item 15(b). Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and
	on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
	we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
	audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and the Board
	of Directors, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
	weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
	that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process
	designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal
	control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
	(ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
	made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s
	assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
	detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
	procedures may deteriorate.

	The goodwill impairment test is applied by performing qualitative and/or quantitative

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	impairment, if any. The second step involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as
	determined in step one. The implied fair value of the goodwill in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of the goodwill, an impairment loss equivalent to

	The Company&#146;s revenue arrangements

</FONT>
	approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is

	interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within taxes on income. Such liabilities are classified as long-term, unless the liability is expected to be resolved within 12 months from the balance sheet date. The Company presents
	unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to deferred tax assets where a net operating loss, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists, when settlement in this manner is available under the applicable tax law.

	In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. This ASU requires that the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer

	In January 2017, the Company extended a convertible loan to PixCell in a total amount of $1.5&nbsp;million. Upon
	the achievement by PixCell of an agreed milestone, this loan would automatically be converted into PixCell shares and the Company would be required to invest an additional amount of $1.5&nbsp;million, following which the Company would expect to hold
	approximately 54% of the outstanding share capital of PixCell. Should PixCell not achieve this milestone, the Company will be entitled, but not obliged, to convert its aforesaid loan into PixCell shares, and to invest an additional amount of
	$1.5&nbsp;million at a lower per share price, following which the Company would (assuming the conversion of certain loans extended by other PixCell shareholders who participated in the convertible loan financing, and the investment of additional
	amounts by such shareholders under the terms of the convertible loan financing) expect to hold approximately 56%, of the outstanding share capital of PixCell. On and from the time of extension of the convertible loan, the Company became entitled to
	appoint the majority of PixCell&#146;s directors, and as a result, is required to include the results of operations of PixCell in its consolidated results of operations beginning January 2017.

	These financial maintenance covenants are tested quarterly, at the end of March, June, September and December of each year
	(commencing in December 2016), in each case by reference to the financial performance of the SD U.K. Group over the preceding 12 months. The U.K. Facilities Agreement limits the amount of intra-group trading that can be carried out between the SD
	U.K. Group and the other parts of the Company. In particular, payments of dividends by the SD U.K. Group to outside the SD U.K. Group, and repayments of loans or advances made to the SD U.K. Group from outside the SD U.K. Group, are restricted, and
	are only permitted upon certain conditions being met. These conditions include that there not be an event of default, the leverage covenant (as described above) not exceeding 2.0 to 1.0 when most recently tested and a look forward certificate being
	issued pursuant to which the SD U.K. Group would confirm that it is projected to remain in compliance with the financial maintenance covenants detailed above for the next six months). In addition, subject to certain exceptions, all transactions

	In June 2012, charges were filed in the Seoul Central District Court of
	the Republic of Korea (the &#147;
<B>
	Seoul Court
</B>
	&#148;) against the Korean subsidiary of the Company and six employees thereof. These charges, as amended in September 2013, related to the alleged acquisition and misuse of confidential information
	of certain of the Company&#146;s significant customers in violation of the Korean Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology, the Korean Unfair Competition Prevention and Trade Secret Protection Act and the Criminal Code
	of Korea. The charges included (1)&nbsp;the unlawful acquisition of certain industrial trade secrets related to the production of active matrix OLED panels of Samsung Mobile Display Co., Ltd. and LG Display Co. Ltd., customers of the Company&#146;s
	Korean subsidiary (the &#147;
<B>
	Customer Technology
</B>
	&#148;), (2) unlawful use of the Customer Technology by preparing certain presentation materials, (3)&nbsp;unlawful divulgence of the Customer Technology to other employees of the Company inside
	and outside of Korea, (4)&nbsp;breach of trust in office by acquiring and divulging the Customer Technology without the customer&#146;s permission for financial gain, and (5)&nbsp;the Korean subsidiary&#146;s vicarious liability for the conduct of
	its employees. In December 2013, the Company&#146;s Korean subsidiary and five of its Korean employees were acquitted by the above court on all charges, and one Korean employee was found guilty of certain legal violations and received a criminal
	fine of approximately $10,000. Following such acquittal, the prosecutor filed a notice of appeal with respect to all aspects of the decision issued by the court. The prosecutor appealed the court&#146;s decision with respect to all the defendants on
	the grounds that the court&#146;s decision contained errors of fact, errors of law and an unjust sentence. The employee of the Company&#146;s Korean subsidiary who was found guilty of certain legal violations and who received a criminal fine also
	appealed the court&#146;s decision issued in respect of him. In December 2014, the appellate panel of the Seoul Court denied all appeals and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	re-affirmed

	the trial court&#146;s decision. Following this
	decision, a notice of appeal was filed by the prosecutor with respect to all aspects of the decision and with respect to all defendants. The Company&#146;s Korean subsidiary and its employees did not appeal the appellate panel&#146;s decision.

	The Company recorded an expense of less than $25,000 in each of the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, and an expense of $0.5&nbsp;million, net of $1.7&nbsp;million insurance reimbursement, in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, in connection with the ongoing Korean litigation, which are recorded in selling,

<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	matter. Because this is an ongoing matter, the Company is unable to predict the outcome or what additional actions, if any, might be taken in the future by the Korean authorities as a result of matters related to this proceeding, and the timing and
	amount of costs associated with the existing and any future matters. However, the applicable Korean laws provide that fines of up to 1.5&nbsp;billion Korean Won (approximately $1.27&nbsp;million at the exchange rate of Korean Won 1,178 = $1.00 in
	effect on December&nbsp;31, 2016) may be levied on employers based on vicarious liability for convicted employees. These amounts may be required to be paid by the Company under certain circumstances. On the basis of information and assessments
	provided by its legal advisors the Company is unable to estimate the outcome of this matter and has therefore not recorded any liability in respect of this matter. The Company and its Korean subsidiary may also become subject to civil actions
	brought by third parties, including the Company&#146;s customers, which may result in monetary judgments, settlements or loss of business or which may require the Company to change its business model.

	From time to time, the Company is involved in other claims and legal and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
	business. In particular, the Company may, from time to time in the conduct of its business, make representations about its products, including their classifications under complex statutory and regulatory regimes and face claims related thereto.
	Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of any such unresolved matters, individually or in the aggregate, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position
	or results of operations. However, litigation and administrative proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and the Company&#146;s view of these matters, including settlement thereof, may change in the future. An unfavorable outcome or
	settlement may have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s financial position and results of operations for the period in which it occurs, and potentially in future periods.

	On June&nbsp;22, 2015, the Board adopted, and the Company&#146;s
	shareholders subsequently approved, the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan is intended to assist the Company in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding employees, officers, directors and/or consultants of the Company and related companies (as defined
	in the 2015 Plan) either existing or which may in the future be organized or acquired by the Company or any related company, by providing them with opportunities to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company by the grant of equity-based
	incentives. The 2015 Plan will terminate on June&nbsp;21, 2025 (except with respect to awards outstanding on that date).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:17%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The 2015 Plan
	provides for the granting of: (i)&nbsp;options to purchase Ordinary Shares; (ii)&nbsp;RSUs; (iii) restricted shares; and (iv)&nbsp;any other equity-based awards that the Board determines are consistent with the purposes of the 2015 Plan. The
	exercise price of options awarded under the 2015 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Ordinary Shares on the date of grant. The 2015 Plan provides for the ability to grant performance-based awards but does not provide for a
	minimum amount of awards that must be subject to performance-based criteria, nor does it specify any guidelines as to the nature of performance criteria that are to be established by the Board.

	The maximum amount of Ordinary Shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan was initially set at 1,375,000 and is to be automatically
	increased (but not decreased) on December&nbsp;31 of each of 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, by the greatest possible number of Ordinary Shares (rounded down to the nearest thousand) which, when added to the sum of: (i)&nbsp;the total number of
	Ordinary Shares then subject to outstanding awards (under the 2015 Plan or any other equity-based remuneration plan of the Company); and (ii)&nbsp;the total number of Ordinary Shares then available for future equity awards (under the 2015 Plan or
	any other equity-based remuneration plan of the Company), would not exceed 9.50% of the total number of Ordinary Shares outstanding at such time. For these purposes, an award is considered to be an &#145;outstanding award&#146; in the fiscal year in
	which it was granted, an option to purchase Ordinary Shares will be considered to be an &#145;outstanding award&#146; thereafter until it is exercised and any award other than options will be considered to be an &#145;outstanding award&#146;
	thereafter until it is no longer subject to conditions requiring continued service of the participant. Under this mechanism, on December&nbsp;31, 2016, the maximum amount of Ordinary Shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan was increased by
	2,121,000 Ordinary Shares.

	opposed to the incentives prior to the 2011 Amendment that were limited to income from Approved or Benefiting Enterprises during their benefits period. According to the 2011 Amendment, the tax rate applicable to such income, referred to as
	&#145;Preferred Income&#146;, would be 10% in areas in Israel that are designated as Development Zone A and 15% elsewhere in Israel during 2011 and 2012, 7% and 12.5%, respectively, in 2013, 9% and 16%, until 2016, and 7.5% and 16%, respectively,
	from 2017 and thereafter. Income derived by a Preferred Company from a &#145;Special Preferred Enterprise&#146; (as defined in the Investment Law) would enjoy further reduced income tax rates for a period of ten years of 5% in Development Zone A and
	8% elsewhere. As of January&nbsp;1, 2014, dividends distributed from Preferred Income would subject the recipient to a 20% tax (or lower, if so provided under an applicable tax treaty), which would generally be withheld at source by the distributing
	company, provided, however, that dividends distributed from &#145;Preferred Income&#146; from one Israeli corporation to another, would not be subject to tax. Under the transitional provisions of the 2011 Amendment, companies may elect to
	irrevocably implement the 2011 Amendment with respect to their existing Approved and Benefiting Enterprises while waiving benefits provided under the legislation prior to the 2011 Amendment or keep implementing the legislation prior to the 2011
	Amendment. Orbotech Ltd. has not elected to implement the 2011 Amendment. While the Company may incur additional tax liability in the event of distribution of dividends from tax exempt income generated from its Approved and Benefiting Enterprises as
	previously described, no additional tax liability will be incurred by the Company in the event of distribution of dividends from Preferred Income.

	Additional amendments to the Investment Law became effective in January 2017 (the &#147;

	2017 Amendment
</B>
	&#148;). Under the 2017 Amendment,
	and provided the conditions stipulated therein are met, income derived by Preferred Companies from &#145;Preferred Technological Enterprises&#146; (as defined in the 2017 Amendment), would be subject to reduced corporate tax rates of 7.5% in
	Development Zone A and 12% elsewhere, or 6% in case of a &#145;Special Preferred Technological Enterprise&#146; (as defined in the 2017 Amendment). A Preferred Company distributing dividends from income derived from its Preferred Technological
	Enterprise or Special Preferred Technological Enterprise, would subject the recipient to a 20% tax (or lower, if so provided under an applicable tax treaty). The 2017 Amendment further provides that, in certain circumstances, a dividend distributed
	to a corporate shareholder who is not an Israeli resident for tax purposes, would be subject to a 4% tax. Such taxes would generally be withheld at source by the distributing company.

	subsidiaries are taxed according to the tax laws in their countries of residence. Certain subsidiaries operate in several jurisdictions outside Israel, some of which benefit from tax incentives such as
	reduced tax rates, investment tax credits and accelerated deductions. If subsidiaries&#146; retained earnings are distributed to the Company in Israel in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be liable to additional Israeli income
	taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The Company&#146;s management has determined not to distribute any amounts of its subsidiaries&#146; undistributed income as a dividend to the Company in Israel
	if such distribution would result in a tax liability. The Company intends to reinvest the amount of such profits; accordingly, no deferred income taxes have been provided for.
