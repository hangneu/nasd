	In connection with obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical
	development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as
	to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical
	trial do not necessarily predict final results. In particular, the small number of patients in our early clinical trials may make the results of these clinical trials less predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials. The design of a clinical
	trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. We have limited experience in designing clinical
	trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product
	candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.

	For example, in 2009, we assigned certain technology relating to our DMD program to BioMarin DMD Regulator Limited, or BioMarin. BioMarin
	conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial of a prior formulation of ezutromid in 48 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects in this clinical trial achieved low systemic exposure of the drug, and there was variability in systemic exposure across subjects.
	Following this clinical trial of a prior formulation of ezutromid, BioMarin elected not to continue development of our assigned technology, citing pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic challenges. In public statements, BioMarin indicated that it had
	concluded that the likelihood of achieving a therapeutic effect in DMD patients was highly unlikely. In 2010, BioMarin transferred the assets, and all commercialization rights, back to us. In our first Phase 1b clinical trial of ezutromid in DMD
	patients, patients also had variable levels of ezutromid in the blood plasma following dosing, which we believe was potentially due to the impact of diet on absorption of ezutromid. In 2015, we reported top-line data from our second Phase 1b
	clinical trial of ezutromid in DMD patients, which we refer to as our Phase 1b modified diet trial, in which patients followed specific dietary guidance that recommended balanced proportions of fat, protein, and carbohydrates and dosing with a glass
	of whole milk. In our Phase 1b modified diet trial, while following specific dietary guidance, all of the patients in the trial achieved plasma levels of ezutromid that may be sufficient to modulate the production of utrophin protein and possibly
	result in clinical benefit. Nonetheless, while the results of our completed clinical trials to date suggest that diet may impact absorption of ezutromid, other disease related factors, such as abnormal gastrointestinal physiology, or other factors
	such as the level of activity of the liver

	In addition, in our first Phase 1b clinical trial of ezutromid in DMD patients, patients experienced a statistically significant reduction in

	the other enzymes compared to baseline potentially indicate a reduction in muscle damage and may be evidence of ezutromid activity. However, in our Phase 1b modified diet trial, we did not observe a change in the levels of CK when patients received
	ezutromid as compared to when patients received a placebo. Likewise, we may not observe changes in levels of CK or other enzyme markers of muscle damage in longer-term clinical trials.

	There is currently

	clinical progression of DMD remains limited despite the recent publication of data from natural history studies on DMD patients. This has resulted in limited clinical trial experience for the development of drugs to treat DMD. In particular,
	regulatory authorities in the United States and European Union have not issued definitive guidance as to how to measure and achieve efficacy. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials for DMD is subject to increased risk.

	In the last few years, a test of the distance walked by a patient in six minutes, commonly referred to as the six minute walk test, has been
	used as an endpoint in several clinical trials of product candidates for patients with DMD. It is viewed by U.S. and European regulators as the only primary outcome measure for DMD trials. We may nonetheless experience setbacks with our clinical
	trials for ezutromid or the clinical trials for our future product candidates for DMD because of the limited clinical experience in this indication. For example, regulators have not yet established what change in the distance walked in the six
	minute walk test is required to be demonstrated in a clinical trial of a DMD therapy in order to signify a clinically meaningful result or obtain marketing approvals. As a result, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint with statistical
	significance in clinical trials of ezutromid or of our other future product candidates for DMD, which would decrease the chance of obtaining marketing approval for ezutromid or our other future product candidates for DMD.

	Our scientific approach for treating DMD focuses on the discovery and development of

	results of our preclinical studies, corresponds to a 50% increase in utrophin expression, we believe that all the patients may still have achieved plasma levels of ezutromid sufficient to modulate the production of utrophin to a lesser extent and
	possibly result in clinical benefit. This belief is based in part on the work of Professor Kay Davies and her research group at the University of Oxford, in which the continued expression of utrophin protein in the transgenic lines of an

	in a specified age range and with a certain level of physical ability only, the number of patients eligible for our clinical trials is even smaller. Further, there are only a limited number of specialist physicians that treat DMD patients, and major
	clinical centers are concentrated in a few geographic regions. CDI is an acute infection that requires rapid diagnosis. For our clinical trials of ridinilazole, we need to identify potential patients, test them for CDI and enroll them on the
	clinical trial within a 24-hour period. In addition, our competitors in both DMD and CDI have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our

	There is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of DMD applicable to all DMD patients that seeks to alter the progression of the

	), which is a small molecule that enables formation of functional dystrophin in DMD patients with nonsense mutations. DMD caused by nonsense mutations affects approximately 13% of all DMD patients.
	The European Commission has granted conditional approval for ataluren in Europe, and PTC is commercializing ataluren in several European countries. Other biopharmaceutical companies, including BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., following their recent
	acquisition of Prosensa Holding N.V., and Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., are developing treatments for DMD based on exon-skipping approaches. We believe that there are exon-skipping therapies currently in clinical development to address four of these
	exons and that skipping of these exons would treat in the aggregate less than one-third of all DMD patients. A number of other companies are pursuing alternative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of DMD, including Pfizer, Inc. and
	Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, which are pursuing an approach based on muscle tissue growth through myostatin inhibition. For more information, see &#147;Business&#151;Competition&#148; in this Annual Report. We believe that our approach of utrophin
	modulation has the potential to treat the entire population of DMD patients, unlike other DMD approaches that also seek to alter the progression of the disease but only address subsets of the total DMD population. We expect the price that we will
	charge for ezutromid, if approved, will reflect its status as an orphan drug that will be directed at a smaller population of patients.

	The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country.
	Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be
	marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after
	initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and
	negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain

	Our ability to commercialize ezutromid, ridinilazole or any other product candidate successfully
	also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations.
	Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the E.U. and U.S. healthcare
	industries and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are
	requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for ezutromid, ridinilazole or
	any other product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining
	and maintaining adequate reimbursement for ezutromid may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices typically associated with drugs directed at smaller populations of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict
	requirements for reimbursement of a higher priced drug. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.

	There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the
	purposes for which the drug is approved by the applicable regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research,
	development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary
	according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be
	reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the
	United States. In the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. In the European Union, reference pricing systems and other measures may lead to
	cost containment and reduced prices. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our
	operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.

	In some countries,
	particularly the member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt
	of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory
	developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced
	and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain
	or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of
	our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected.

	The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical
	companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights
	are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies
	and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents, narrow the scope of our patent protection or make enforcement more difficult or

	The laws of foreign countries may not protect our patent rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For
	example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. In addition, for the foregoing reasons, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets or may not obtain
	protection that enables us to prevent the entry of third parties into the market.

	Assuming the other requirements for patentability are
	met, currently, the first to file&nbsp;a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March&nbsp;16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the
	scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18&nbsp;months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know
	with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our U.S. patents or pending U.S. patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions outside the United States or, since
	March&nbsp;16, 2013, within the United States.

	The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may

	ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Future changes in U.S. statutory or case law beyond our control could
	affect some or all of the foregoing possibilities. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such
	candidates are commercialized. This could be the case even after giving effect to patent term extensions and data exclusivity provisions preventing third parties from relying on clinical trial data filed by us for regulatory approval in support of

	Our
	commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary
	rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual
	property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference, derivation, inter partes review, reexamination, reissue or post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO. The risks of being involved in such litigation and office
	proceedings may also increase as our product candidates approach commercialization, and as we gain greater visibility as a publicly traded company in the United States. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or
	future intellectual property rights and so restrict our freedom to operate. Third parties may also seek injunctive relief against us, whereby they would attempt to prevent us from practicing our technologies altogether pending outcome of any
	litigation against us. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates prior to their assertion against us. For example, we have not conducted an in-depth freedom-to-operate search or
	analysis for ezutromid or ridinilazole. Any freedom-to-operate search or analysis previously conducted may not have uncovered all relevant patents and pending patent applications, and there may be pending or future patent applications that, if
	issued, would block us from commercializing ezutromid or ridinilazole. Thus, we do not know with certainty whether ezutromid, ridinilazole or any other product candidate or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe any third
	party&#146;s intellectual property.

	If we are found to infringe a third party&#146;s intellectual property rights, or in order to avoid
	or settle litigation, we could be required to obtain a license to enable us to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even
	if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies as are licensed to us, and could require us to make substantial payments. Absent a license, we could be forced, including
	by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or
	other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have
	misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties, or claims that we derived our inventions from another, could have a similar negative impact on our business.

	may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, costs and lost management time, as well as uncertainties resulting from the initiation and

	In addition
	to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary and confidential information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these
	trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants,
	advisors and other third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Any
	party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary or confidential information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a
	claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to
	protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to
	compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, particularly unpatented know-how, were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.

	We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain
	marketing approvals for product candidates and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting
	information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate&#146;s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to,
	and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that ezutromid, ridinilazole or any of our other future product candidates are not effective or only moderately effective, or have

	The process of obtaining marketing approvals is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially
	based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations,
	or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any
	application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit
	or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. If we experience

	In order to market and sell ezutromid, ridinilazole and our other future product candidates in jurisdictions other than the United States and

	that required to obtain FDA or EMA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States and Europe generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA and EMA approval. In addition, some countries outside the United
	States and Europe require approval of the sales price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, separate procedures must be followed to obtain reimbursement. We may not obtain marketing, pricing or reimbursement approvals outside the

	If the FDA determines that a product candidate offers major advances in treatment or provides a treatment
	where no adequate therapy exists, the FDA may designate the product candidate for priority review. A priority review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review period of ten
	months. Because the FDA designated ridinilazole as a qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP, ridinilazole also will receive priority review. We may also request priority review for ezutromid or other future product candidates. The FDA has
	broad discretion with respect to whether or not to grant priority review status to a product candidate, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for such designation or status, the FDA may decide not to grant it. Moreover, a
	priority review designation does not necessarily mean a faster regulatory review process or necessarily confer any advantage with respect to approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Receiving priority review from the FDA does not guarantee
	approval within the six-month review cycle or thereafter.

	Regulatory authorities in some
	jurisdictions, including Europe and the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to ezutromid for the treatment of DMD, and the EMA has designated
	ezutromid as an orphan medicinal product. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity,
	which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the EMA from accepting another marketing application for a similar medicinal product or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time
	period. The applicable market exclusivity period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. The E.U. exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation,

	such as ezutromid, the FDA defines &#147;same drug&#148; as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use. Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity for ezutromid for DMD, both in the United States and in Europe, may be
	important to the product candidate&#146;s success. If a competitor obtains orphan drug exclusivity for and approval of a product with the same indication as ezutromid before we do and if the competitor&#146;s product is the same drug or a similar

	have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity will not prevent the approval of a product that is the same drug as our product candidate if the FDA finds that we cannot assure the

	In the United States, the Medicare

	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel medicines for indications for which
	there are no existing or only inadequate therapies. We are conducting clinical programs focused on the genetic disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, and the infectious disease

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our
	lead DMD product candidate is ezutromid (formerly SMT C1100), an orally administered small molecule. We expect to commence enrollment and dosing of patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial of ezutromid in patients with DMD during the second quarter of
	2016. This trial is designed to evaluate the potential benefits of longer-term dosing of ezutromid by measuring a number of endpoints related to muscle health and muscle function, along with monitoring the safety and tolerability of long-term
	exposure to ezutromid. We refer to this Phase 2 clinical trial as PhaseOut DMD, a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial. We expect to report data periodically during this trial with the first set of 24-week muscle biopsy data from the first group
	of patients enrolled expected to be reported in January 2017. Our DMD program is based on utrophin modulation, an approach to treating DMD that is independent of the underlying mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause the disease. We are a leader
	in the field of utrophin modulation, an approach that we believe has the potential to address the entire population of DMD patients. Other DMD approaches, such as exon-skipping and suppression of nonsense mutations, only address subsets of this
	population. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has granted orphan drug designation to ezutromid for the treatment of DMD, and the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, has designated ezutromid as an orphan medicinal product.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	DMD is one of the most common and the most severe form of muscular dystrophy. DMD predominantly affects males and results in the progressive
	wasting of muscles throughout the body. The disease typically results in death by the time DMD patients reach their late twenties. Individuals with DMD are unable to produce dystrophin, a protein essential for maintaining healthy muscle function.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Utrophin is a naturally occurring protein that is functionally and structurally similar to dystrophin. Utrophin plays an active role in
	the development of new muscle fibers, in particular during fetal development, and in repairing damaged muscle fibers. Utrophin production is down regulated, or switched off, in the late stages of gestation and can switch on and off as needed to
	repair damaged muscle. We believe that our approach of utrophin modulation can be used to maintain the production of utrophin in all skeletal muscles, including the diaphragm, and the heart to compensate for the lack of dystrophin in DMD patients,
	thereby restoring and maintaining healthy muscle function. This approach to treating DMD is independent of the underlying dystrophin gene mutation, and we believe has the potential to treat the entire population of DMD patients.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To date, we have conducted three Phase 1 clinical trials of ezutromid. We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of ezutromid in healthy
	volunteers in 2012, a Phase 1b clinical trial of ezutromid in DMD patients in May 2014 and another Phase 1b clinical trial of ezutromid in DMD patients in September 2015. The second Phase 1b clinical trial of ezutromid in DMD patients that evaluated
	the impact of diet on plasma levels of the drug. We refer to this second Phase 1b as our Phase 1b modified diet trial. In all of our Phase 1 trials, ezutromid was well tolerated at all doses tested with no serious adverse events reported. We hold
	exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for ezutromid for all indications.

	Our lead CDI product candidate is ridinilazole (formerly SMT19969), an orally administered small molecule antibiotic. We reported positive
	top-line results from a Phase 2 clinical trial of ridinilazole in November 2015 and reported additional data in April 2016. Ridinilazole is designed to selectively target
<I>
	Clostridium difficile
</I>
	bacteria without causing collateral damage to the
	gut flora and thereby reduce CDI recurrence rates, which is the key clinical issue in this disease. The FDA has designated ridinilazole as a qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP, and the FDA granted ridinilazole fast track status in July
	2015. In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or CDC, highlighted CDI as one of three pathogens that pose an immediate public health threat and require urgent and aggressive
	action.

	CDI is a bacterial infection of the colon that produces toxins causing inflammation of the colon and severe diarrhea. CDI can
	also result in more serious disease complications, including pseudomembranous colitis, bowel perforation, toxic megacolon and sepsis. CDI typically develops following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics that can cause widespread damage to the
	natural gut flora and allow overgrowth of
<I>
	Clostridium difficile
</I>
	bacteria. CDI represents a serious healthcare issue in hospitals, long-term care homes and, increasingly, in the wider community. A study published in 2012 in
<I>
	Clinical
	Infectious Diseases

	, a peer reviewed journal published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, estimated that CDI-related acute care costs total $4.8 billion per year in the United States alone.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of ridinilazole in healthy volunteers in 2013. In this Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial, ridinilazole was
	highly selective for total
<I>
	clostridia
</I>
	bacteria with minimal impact on the other gut flora of subjects, which was consistent with the results of our preclinical studies of ridinilazole. In November 2015, we reported top-line results from our
	double blind, randomized, active controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated ridinilazole compared to the current standard of care, vancomycin, for the treatment of CDI. The Phase 2 clinical trial exceeded its primary endpoint of
	non-inferiority, with ridinilazole achieving statistical superiority over vancomycin in sustained clinical response, or SCR. The statistical superiority was driven by a large numerical reduction in recurrent disease compared with vancomycin.
	Preliminary analysis of the data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of ridinilazole also showed ridinilazole to be highly preserving of the gut microbiome compared to patients who received vancomycin, who experienced substantial damage to the gut
	microbiome which for many patients persisted during the 30-day post-treatment period. Ridinilazole was well tolerated at all doses tested in both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. We hold exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for
	ridinilazole for all indications.

	We are focusing our resources and business efforts primarily on rapidly advancing the development of ezutromid for the treatment of DMD and
	ridinilazole for the treatment of CDI. We believe that there is significant market potential for each of these product candidates. We also believe that the orphan drug designation of ezutromid and the QIDP and fast track designations of ridinilazole
	may expedite the regulatory review process for each of these product candidates and potentially provide market protection benefits. We expect to commence enrollment and dosing of patients in PhaseOut DMD at trial sites in the United Kingdom during
	the second quarter of 2016 and at trial sites in the United States during the third quarter of 2016. This Phase 2 clinical trial is expected to evaluate the benefits of longer-term dosing of ezutromid by measuring a number of endpoints related to
	muscle health and muscle function, including levels of utrophin protein in muscle fibers and levels of muscle fiber regeneration from muscle biopsies, changes in muscle inflammation and fat infiltration through the use of magnetic resonance imaging,
	or MRI, the distance walked during the six minute walk test and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment, a test of motor functions. We expect to report data periodically during this trial with the first set of 24-week muscle biopsy data from the first
	group of patients enrolled expected to be reported in January 2017. We reported top-line data from our double blind, randomized, active controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated ridinilazole compared to vancomycin for the treatment of CDI in

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Duchenne muscular dystrophy is one of the most common and the most severe form of muscular dystrophy. DMD is a fatal disease that results in
	progressive wasting of muscles throughout the body. DMD is caused by different genetic mutations affecting the dystrophin gene on the X-chromosome, and therefore predominately affects males. As a result of these genetic mutations, DMD patients are
	unable to produce dystrophin, a protein essential for maintaining healthy muscle function. Over time, the muscles of DMD patients deteriorate and are infiltrated by fat and scar tissue, which is referred to as fibrosis, leading to the loss of
	ambulation, loss of respiratory and cardiac function and ultimately death.

	Based on prevalence data published in July 2015 by Orphanet, a publicly available reference
	portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs, we estimate that there are approximately 50,000 DMD patients in the developed world and 250,000 DMD patients globally. According to an article published in 2013 in the peer reviewed journal

	, approximately one in every 5,000 males is born with DMD. All ethnic groups are generally susceptible to DMD at approximately the same rates. Approximately two-thirds of DMD cases are due to inherited mutations, with
	the remainder being the result of spontaneous mutations in the dystrophin gene in patients with no familial history of the disease.

	DMD
	is typically diagnosed in patients who are between two and seven years of age. The onset of the physical symptoms can be difficult to recognize, but early indicators of disease due to muscle weakness include difficulty walking or jumping, frequent
	falling over and becoming fatigued more easily. A preliminary diagnosis is typically made by measuring blood plasma levels of the enzyme creatine kinase, or CK. CK levels in DMD children are often ten to 100 times higher than CK levels in non-DMD
	children. A diagnosis of DMD is then confirmed through genetic testing using blood cells or muscle biopsy. In the United States and Europe, there are a number of newborn screening studies that can diagnose DMD at birth, although these tests are not

	Initially, DMD affects the skeletal muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. By around 12 years of age, most DMD
	patients will need to use a wheelchair on a regular basis. Significant loss of skeletal muscle function takes place during the teenage years, and, while greater assistance is needed for activities involving arms, legs or trunk, most patients will
	retain use of their fingers, allowing them to write or use computers. Symptoms of scoliosis, or curvature of the spine, may also develop due to loss of trunk muscle function.

	In the later stages of disease progression, life threatening heart and respiratory conditions become common. The function of the diaphragm and
	muscles responsible for the mechanical aspects of breathing deteriorates, leading to shortness of breath and build-up of fluid in the lungs and requiring ventilation at night and eventually on a 24-hour basis. DMD patients also develop
	cardiomyopathy, or enlarged hearts. The failure of the cardiac and respiratory systems typically leads to death by the time DMD patients reach their late twenties.

	There is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of DMD applicable to all DMD patients that seeks to alter the progression of the
	disease. Corticosteroids are prescribed to DMD patients from a young age to help treat symptoms of the disease. However, long-term use of corticosteroids is associated with severe side effects and concerns over weight gain. Other treatments to
	manage the symptoms of the disease include regular physiotherapy, surgery and mechanical support, such as wheelchairs and leg braces, and dietary supplements. The FDA recognizes the unmet medical need in DMD, the devastating nature of the disease
	for patients and their families and the urgency to make new treatments available. The FDA publicly stated in October 2014 that it remains committed to working with all companies to expedite the development and approval of safe and effective drugs to
	treat this disease. The Director of the FDA&#146;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research also stated in a speech in July 2014 that the agency was willing to explore the use of all potential pathways for approval of DMD drugs, including accelerated
	approval, as appropriate. In June 2015, the FDA issued draft guidance on developing drugs for the treatment of DMD and related dystrophinopathies.

	There are different approaches in development for the treatment of DMD, some of which seek to alter the progression of the disease by
	targeting the underlying genetic cause and others that seek to provide symptomatic relief. One approach that seeks to alter the progression of the disease involves targeting the specific genetic mutations known as nonsense mutations. Nonsense
	mutations create a premature stop signal in the translation of the genetic code and prevent the production of functional dystrophin protein. DMD caused by nonsense mutations affects approximately 13% of all DMD patients. Other disease modifying
	treatment approaches for DMD are based on a scientific approach known as exon-skipping. Exons are organic molecules known as nucleotides within the DNA strand that the cellular machinery translates to make truncated but functional protein.

	In a sub-population of DMD patients, synthesis of the dystrophin protein is disrupted because of mutations that may be due, among other things, to deleted exons. Exon-skipping technology seeks to
	allow the production of a truncated but still functional dystrophin protein. According to an article published in 2009 in the peer reviewed journal

	, skipping of the ten most common exons would treat in aggregate approximately
	41% of all DMD patients. We believe that there are exon-skipping therapies currently in clinical development to address four of these exons and that skipping of these would treat in aggregate less than one-third of all DMD patients. A number of
	other treatments being developed seek to alleviate the symptoms of DMD. These include promotion of muscle tissue growth based on myostatin inhibition, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drugs, treatments to improve respiratory function, and gene

	This approach to treating DMD is independent of the underlying dystrophin gene mutation. As illustrated in the figure below, we believe utrophin modulation has the potential to treat the entire population of DMD patients, unlike other DMD approaches
	that also seek to alter the progression of the disease but only address subsets of the total DMD population.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Each muscle in the body is made up of bundles of thousands of muscle fibers. Dystrophin and a group of different proteins that bind to
	dystrophin, which are called the Dystrophin Associated Protein Complex, are located at specific sites along the entire length of the muscle cell membrane, referred to as the sarcolemma, of every muscle fiber. Dystrophin works by linking the actin
	cytoskeleton, which is a part of the muscle fiber&#146;s contractile apparatus, to the Dystrophin Associated Protein Complex in the sarcolemma. The Dystrophin Associated Protein Complex, in turn, links the sarcolemma to the extracellular matrix,
	which binds the bundles of muscle fibers together. This link serves as a molecular shock absorber that helps to maintain stability and elasticity of muscle fibers during contraction and relaxation. In the absence of dystrophin, this linkage is lost
	and muscles become damaged, which leads to continual destructive rounds of muscle degeneration and regeneration and ultimately to progressive muscle wasting. The figure below depicts the Dystrophin Associated Protein Complex and illustrates the role
	of dystrophin (or utrophin) and the other proteins that make up this complex.

	In both DMD patients and healthy individuals, utrophin and the proteins that comprise the Dystrophin Associated Protein Complex are highly
	localized at specific sites along the length of muscle fibers during fetal development. Utrophin production is then down regulated, or switched off, in the late stages of gestation. In the normal muscle fiber of healthy individuals, the production
	of dystrophin begins to replace utrophin at these sites in the maturing muscle fiber, eventually fully replacing utrophin. In the muscle fiber of DMD patients, who are unable to produce functional dystrophin to substitute for the down regulating
	utrophin, these sites in the muscle fiber become unoccupied, which leads to muscle degeneration as muscles mature.

	Phase 2 trial as PhaseOut DMD. We expect to commence enrollment and dosing of patients in PhaseOut DMD at trial sites in the United Kingdom during the second quarter of 2016 and at trial sites in the United States during the third quarter of 2016.
	The PhaseOut DMD trial will evaluate the benefits of longer-term dosing of ezutromid by measuring a number of endpoints related to muscle health and muscle function, including levels of utrophin protein in muscle fibers and levels of muscle fiber
	regeneration from muscle biopsies, changes in muscle inflammation and fat infiltration through the use of MRI, distance walked during a six minute walk test and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment. We expect to report data periodically during this
	trial with the first set of 24-week muscle biopsy data from the first group of patients enrolled expected to be reported in January 2017.

	We are currently developing ezutromid as a flavored aqueous suspension for use in our PhaseOut DMD trial, and we believe this formulation is
	appropriate for administration to DMD patients, especially children.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also developing an optimized formulation of ezutromid that
	may be capable of achieving higher plasma levels in all patients treated with ezutromid. In March 2016, we reported interim data from our ongoing Phase 1 dose escalating clinical trial of ezutromid. The interim data from the trial showed that, in
	healthy volunteers, one of the two new formulations achieved an over ten-fold increase in plasma levels of ezutromid compared to the current clinical formulation of ezutromid. This formulation was selected to progress into the second part of the
	trial and undergo evaluation in patients with DMD. The Phase 1 dose escalating clinical trial is also expected to evaluate higher doses of the new formulation.

	The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to ezutromid for the treatment of DMD, and the EMA has designated ezutromid as an orphan medicinal
	product. In the United States, if a product with orphan designation receives FDA approval, the FDA will not approve a later product for the same indication that uses the same active ingredient for seven years, unless the later product is shown to be
	clinically superior. In the European Union, if an orphan medicinal product receives EMA approval, the EMA will not approve a later product for the same therapeutic indication and with the same method of action for ten years after the orphan
	medicinal product receives EMA approval, subject to certain exceptions, including if the later product demonstrates clinical superiority.

</B>
	When we administered 100 mg/kg doses of ezutromid twice a day for ten days, the steady state plasma concentration achieved in all
	subjects was greater than 0.2 &micro;M (67 ng/mL), which was the concentration that corresponded to a 50% increase in utrophin protein levels in our preclinical studies described in more detail below. The mean blood plasma concentration of ezutromid
	in the 12 hours following administration of the final dose is illustrated in the figure below. However, there were differences among subjects, with the amount of time that each subject had plasma concentrations of utrophin protein greater than 0.2
	&micro;M ranging from seven to 12 hours following dosing. Utrophin protein has a half-life of three to four weeks, and we believe that a few hours of exposure to ezutromid following regular dosing may lead to an accumulation of utrophin protein in
	muscle tissue over time. Subjects receiving 200 mg/kg doses of ezutromid twice a day for ten days did not achieve higher plasma concentrations of ezutromid than subjects receiving 100 mg/kg doses of ezutromid on this dosing schedule. As a result, we
	expect that the maximum dose of ezutromid in our future clinical trials will be 100 mg/kg.

</I>
</B>
	We observed variability among patients in all three cohorts in plasma concentrations of ezutromid
	after administering multiple daily doses for eleven days. As illustrated in the figure below, the mean blood plasma concentrations of two of the 12 DMD patients, who we refer to as high absorbers, exceeded the target level of 0.2 &micro;M (67 ng/mL)
	for several hours following dosing. We determined this target level prior to conducting this clinical trial based on the composite results of our preclinical studies in tissue culture, or
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	preclinical studies, and our preclinical
	studies in live animals, or
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	preclinical studies, which indicated that this plasma concentration leads to an increase of approximately 50% in levels of utrophin protein. The mean plasma concentrations of the remaining ten patients, who
	we refer to as low absorbers, were less than this target level and similar to the levels achieved by fasted healthy volunteers in our completed Phase 1 clinical trial who had received a single 200 mg/kg dose of ezutromid. Nonetheless, we believe
	that the patients who did not achieve the target plasma level in the clinical trial may still have achieved a plasma level of ezutromid sufficient to modulate the production of utrophin and possibly result in a clinical benefit. This belief is based
	in part on the work of Professor Davies&#146; research group, in which the continued expression of utrophin protein in transgenic lines of an
<I>
	mdx

	mouse, even at levels just above those in a normal

	We believe that the similarity of ezutromid plasma levels between the majority of DMD patients in this
	Phase 1b clinical trial and fasted healthy volunteers in our completed Phase 1 clinical trial may be due to a complex absorption profile in DMD patients that results from patients following low fat, low calorie diets. DMD patients often follow such
	diets due to concerns over the consequences of long-term corticosteroid use and potential resulting weight gain. In addition, we believe that other DMD disease-related factors, such as abnormal gastrointestinal physiology, may impact the absorption
	profile of DMD patients.

</I>
</B>
	We observed a reduction compared to baseline in the enzymes CK, aspartate aminotransferase, or AST, and alanine
	aminotransferase, or ALT, in over 90% of the patients in the clinical trial during dosing with ezutromid. Other liver associated enzymes, gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase and albumin, showed no meaningful change from baseline over
	the same dosing period. The levels of CK, ALT and AST are typically low in healthy people. In DMD patients, however, damage to muscle fibers leads to the release of these enzymes from the muscle and accumulation in the blood. The mean reductions in
	CK, ALT and AST were statistically significant as compared to the baseline pre-dose levels (p &lt;0.05). We determine statistical significance based on a widely used, conventional statistical method that establishes the p-value of clinical results.
	Typically, a p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance. Following the end of dosing, the levels of these enzymes increased toward pre-dose levels. In addition, the reduction in CK was consistent with the results of a preclinical
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	study that we conducted in the
<I>
	mdx
</I>
	mouse model, described in more detail below, in which we observed a reduction in CK following single daily dosing of ezutromid. We did not observe a correlation between the dose level of
	ezutromid administered and the degree of change in the levels of these enzymes. Although this was not a placebo controlled study and there may be other factors that influenced the results, we believed at the time that the lower levels of CK, AST and
	ALT compared to baseline potentially indicate a reduction in muscle damage and may be evidence of ezutromid activity. We consequently further evaluated this observed reduction in the enzyme markers of muscle damage in our subsequent Phase 1b
	modified diet trial. The results of the Phase 1b modified diet trial are described below.

	The primary objective of this clinical trial was to determine the pharmacokinetics of single and
	multiple oral doses of ezutromid in patients with DMD who followed specific dietary guidance that recommended balanced proportions of fat (30%), protein (25%)&nbsp;and carbohydrates (45%)&nbsp;and dosing with a glass of whole milk. We sought to
	achieve this dietary balance by requesting that patients, with support from research dietitians and the patients&#146; legal guardians, consume a diet containing all of the major food groups, vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber, with a daily
	calorie intake that is appropriate for the age and activity level of each patient. The goal of this dietary guidance was to demonstrate an increase in the level of ezutromid in blood plasma compared to the blood plasma levels we observed among DMD
	patients in our initial Phase 1b clinical trial. The trial protocol included a number of secondary objectives, including evaluations of the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of ezutromid; the daily variability in the steady
	state pharmacokinetics of ezutromid; and the levels of CK as a potential biomarker of ezutromid activity.

	a placebo. All doses were administered orally with 100 mL of whole milk and with patients having consumed either breakfast or an evening meal depending on the time of day. There was a wash out period, which is a period of time during which patients
	received no administration of the drug, of at least 14 days between each of the treatment periods. The clinical trial was blinded as to the order in which patients received the lower dose of drug, higher dose of drug or placebo. The patients in each

	mean of 8.2 hours in the same 22-hour period on day 14. Plasma levels of 30 ng/mL and 67 ng/mL correlate to an increase in utrophin levels of approximately 30% and 50%, respectively, based on our

	In 2009, we assigned certain technology relating to our DMD program to BioMarin DMD Regulator Limited, or BioMarin. In 2010, BioMarin conducted
	a Phase 1 clinical trial of a prior formulation of ezutromid in 48 healthy adult volunteers. The clinical trial was conducted at a single site in the United Kingdom. BioMarin reported that ezutromid was well tolerated by the subjects in this
	clinical trial. Subjects in this trial achieved low systemic exposure of the drug, and there was variability in systemic exposure across subjects. Following this clinical trial of a prior formulation of ezutromid, BioMarin elected not to continue
	development of our assigned technology, citing pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic challenges. In public statements, BioMarin indicated that it had concluded that the likelihood of achieving a therapeutic effect in DMD patients was highly unlikely.
	In 2010, BioMarin transferred the assets, and all commercialization rights, back to us. As described above, in our Phase 1 clinical trial of ezutromid in healthy volunteers, in which we administered ezutromid as a flavored aqueous suspension, we

	The primary objective of our PhaseOut DMD clinical trial is to investigate changes from baseline in leg muscle health using MRI. Reports in the
	peer reviewed literature have shown MRI has potential as a non-invasive biomarker to measure disease progression through measurement of changes in inflammation and fat infiltration in leg muscles. This trial will monitor disease progression after
	treatment with ezutromid by measuring changes from baseline in levels of muscle inflammation and fat infiltration in leg muscle during the course of the 48 week trial. We will also investigate if there are any relationships between changes in leg
	muscle MRI with blood plasma concentrations of ezutromid, which we will measure at baseline and over the course of the trial.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also

	and changes in muscle regeneration biomarkers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The clinical trial is also expected to investigate a number of functional measures. These
	will include changes from baseline in distance walked during the six minute walk test, changes from baseline in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment, changes from baseline in a 10 meter run test, and changes from baseline in performance of upper
	limbs. We will also monitor changes in a variety of blood biomarkers related to muscle health, including the enzyme CK, during the trial.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that these objectives collectively will enable us to better understand the potential benefits of long-term dosing with ezutromid on
	the progression of DMD in a pediatric population. We will also seek to understand if there are any potential relationships between changes in MRI, utrophin expression, muscle fiber regeneration and other assessments of muscle function. This trial
	will be the longest period of time that ezutromid has been dosed in patients and will increase the amount of safety and tolerability data for ezutromid.

	formulation of ezutromid. In March 2016, we reported interim data from the Phase 1 clinical trial. In healthy volunteers, one of the two new formulations achieved an over ten-fold increase in plasma levels of ezutromid compared to the current
	clinical formulation of ezutromid. This formulation was selected to progress into the second part of the trial and undergo evaluation in patients with DMD.

	In the initial dosing period, patients who received a 250 mg fixed dose of the new formulation of ezutromid for seven days achieved plasma
	levels of ezutromid similar to those of patients who received a 2,500 mg fixed dose of the current formulation of ezutromid in the Phase 1b modified diet trial. The new formulation of ezutromid was generally well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and
	in the patients who received the first dose level of the new formulation of ezutromid. Participants in this trial are also following similar dietary guidance to those in the prior Phase 1b modified diet clinical trial. The Phase 1 clinical trial is
	now evaluating higher doses of the new formulation, and we expect to report top-line data from this trial in the third quarter of 2016. We expect to evaluate our options for further development of the new formulation after we have all of the data

	Infection is a bacterial infection of the colon that
	produces toxins causing inflammation of the colon and severe diarrhea. CDI can also result in more serious disease complications, including pseudomembranous colitis, bowel perforation, toxic megacolon and sepsis. CDI represents a serious healthcare
	issue in hospitals, long-term care homes and, increasingly, in the wider community. We estimate there are over one million cases of CDI each year in the United States and Europe, based on an epidemiology report on CDI that was published in 2015 by
	Decision Resources, a healthcare research and consulting company. In addition, CDI is responsible for approximately 29,000 deaths per year in the United States, according to a study published in the
<I>
	New England Journal of Medicine
</I>
	in 2015. A
	separate study published in 2012 in
<I>
	Clinical Microbiology and Infection
</I>
	, a peer reviewed journal published by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, indicated that CDI may be underdiagnosed in approximately 25%
	of cases. A study published in
<I>
	The Journal of Hospital Infection
</I>
	, a peer reviewed journal published by the Healthcare Infection Society, reported that CDI is two to four times more common than hospital associated infections caused by
	methicillin-resistant
<I>
	Staphylococcus aureus
</I>
	, a bacterium frequently associated with such infections. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, a family of databases developed through a federal-state-industry partnership sponsored by the
	Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the U.S. Department of Health&nbsp;and Human Services, reported an approximate 3.5 fold increase in hospital stays associated with CDI between 2000 and 2008. The economic impact of CDI is significant. A

	CDI originates from a bacterium known as

<I>
	C. difficile

	gut flora and allow overgrowth of

	Existing treatment options for CDI are limited. The current standard of care for CDI is treatment with vancomycin or off label use of

<I>
	C. difficile

	bacteria without causing collateral damage to the gut flora and thereby reduce CDI recurrence rates. The active ingredient in ridinilazole is a bis-benzimidazole tetrahydrate. We believe, based on

	In November 2015, we reported top-line results from our double blind, randomized, active controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated
	ridinilazole compared to the current standard of care, vancomycin, for the treatment of CDI. The Phase 2 clinical trial exceeded its primary endpoint of non-inferiority, with ridinilazole achieving statistical superiority over vancomycin in
	sustained clinical response, or SCR. The statistical superiority was driven by a large numerical reduction in recurrent disease compared with vancomycin. We subsequently reported that preliminary analysis of the data from our Phase 2 clinical trial
	also showed ridinilazole to be highly preserving of the gut microbiome compared to patients who received vancomycin, who experienced substantial damage to the gut microbiome which for many patients persisted during the 30-day post-treatment period.
	We expect to continue to report further data from this trial at future medical and scientific conferences. We are undertaking activities required to advance ridinilazole into Phase 3 clinical trials. We are also evaluating our options for the future
	development and commercialization of ridinilazole. Our preferred option is to seek third-party collaborators but we are continuing to evaluate the relative merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves or seeking funding from government

	vancomycin, and ridinilazole achieved a recurrence rate of 14.3% compared to 34.8% for vancomycin during the 30-day post-treatment period. The primary analysis was conducted on the modified intent-to-treat, or mITT, population (36 patients dosed
	with ridinilazole, 33 patients dosed with vancomycin) that comprised patients with CDI confirmed by the presence of free toxin. The results of the mITT population were consistent with the intent-to-treat, or ITT, population (50 patients dosed with

	We observed that vancomycin treated patients suffered substantial damage to their microbiome during treatment and that this damage persisted in many patients during the 30-day post-treatment period. Ridinilazole was generally well tolerated and the

	In a hamster model, we infected one group of hamsters with the hypervirulent CDI strain ribotype 027 and a second group of hamsters with a second CDI strain ribotype 012.
	In the United States, the hypervirulent CDI strain ribotype 027 accounts for approximately one third of all CDI cases. We then treated hamsters from each of the two infected groups with different doses of ridinilazole, vancomycin and fidaxomicin for
	five days. We evaluated disease recurrence over the 21 days following treatment. In this hamster model, a hamster fatality within the first five days is a result of initial
<I>
	C. difficile
</I>
	infection, while a fatality from day six to day 25 is a
	result of recurrent disease. As illustrated in the figure below, the hamsters from both infected groups that were treated with two different doses of ridinilazole had survival rates of 90% to 100% against strain ribotype 027 and 80% to 100% against
	strain ribotype 012. These survival rates were higher than hamsters treated with vancomycin (0% to 10% survival rates) for both CDI strains, comparable to hamsters treated with two different doses of fidaxomicin against strain ribotype 027 (90% to
	100% survival rates) and higher than hamsters treated with two different doses of fidaxomicin against strain ribotype 012 (0% to 40% survival rates). All infection control hamsters received placebo and died by the second day following infection.

	BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., or BioMarin, following the acquisition of Prosensa Holding N.V. that was completed in
	2015, and Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., or Sarepta, are developing treatments for DMD based on exon-skipping approaches. Exons are organic molecules known as nucleotides within the DNA strand that the cellular machinery translates to make full-length,
	functional protein. In a sub-population of DMD patients, synthesis of the dystrophin protein is disrupted because of mutations that may be due, among other things, to deleted exons. Exon-skipping technology seeks to allow the production of a shorter
	but still functional dystrophin protein. BioMarin&#146;s most advanced exon-skipping drug is drisapersen (Kyndrisa&#153;). BioMarin completed a rolling NDA submission for drisapersen to the FDA seeking accelerated approval in April 2015. In January
	2016, the FDA issued to BioMarin a &#147;complete response&#148; letter to the NDA for drisapersen which indicated that the review cycle for the application was complete and that the application was not ready for approval in its present form due to
	the standard of substantial evidence of effectiveness having not been met. BioMarin submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for drisapersen, which was validated in June 2015 and remains
	under review. Drisapersen targets exon 51 and would be applicable to approximately 13% of all DMD patients. Sarepta&#146;s most advanced product candidate is eteplirsen (Exondys 51&#153;). Sarepta filed its NDA for eteplirsen with the FDA in August
	2015, which was reviewed by the FDA in April 2016. Eteplirsen also targets exon 51 and would therefore be applicable to approximately 13% of all DMD patients. BioMarin and Sarepta are also developing other exon-skipping therapies to treat other
	genetic mutations. These companies have product candidates in clinical trials that are targeting exon 44, which is applicable to 6% of all DMD patients, exon 45, which is applicable to 8% of all DMD patients, and exon 53, which is applicable to 6%
	of all DMD patients. According to an article published in 2009 in the peer reviewed journal
<I>
	Human Mutation
</I>
	, skipping of the ten most common exons would treat in the aggregate approximately 41% of all DMD patients. We believe that there are
	exon-skipping therapies currently in clinical development to address four of these exons and that skipping of these exons would treat in the aggregate less than one-third of all DMD patients.

	antibiotic fidaxomicin (Dificid&#153; in the United States, Dificlir&#153; in Europe) was recently approved for the treatment of CDI in the United States and the European Union. Fidaxomicin was originally developed by Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
	which was later acquired by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Cubist. Cubist was recently acquired by Merck&nbsp;&amp; Co., Inc., or Merck. Other antibiotics in late-stage clinical trials for treatment of CDI include cadazolid, which is being
	developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Limited and is currently in Phase 3 clinical development and surotomycin, which was originally developed by Cubist, and later acquired by Merck. Merck reported that it had received unfavorable efficacy data from
	a Phase 3 clinical trial for surotomycin in August 2015.

	Other CDI approaches.
</I>
	A number of other approaches for the treatment of
	CDI are in development. Merck is developing the monoclonal antibodies bezlotoxumab, which completed Phase 3 clinical trials in 2015. In January 2016 the FDA accepted for review the Biologics License Application, or BLA, for bezlotoxumab and granted
	a &#147;priority review.&#148; Merck has also filed a MAA with EMA. This antibody neutralizes certain toxins that are produced by
<I>
	C. difficile
</I>
	bacteria and would be an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics. Sanofi Pasteur is developing the
	vaccine ACAM-CDIFF for primary prevention of CDI. ACAM-CDIFF is likely to be used only in high-risk patients given the difficulty of administering a vaccine to a broad population. Fecal biotherapy aims to recolonize the bacteria that comprise the
	natural gut flora and would also be adjunctive therapy to antibiotics. Fecal biotherapy approaches in development include SER-109, which is being developed by Seres Therapeutics, Inc., formerly Seres Health, Inc. and which recently initiated a Phase
	2 trial to assess safety and efficacy, and RBX2660, which is being developed by Rebiotix, Inc. and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

	We currently engage a single, third-party manufacturer to provide clinical material of the active

	The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries,
	including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a
	patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent.

	The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval, or PMA, may
	also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided that certain statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory
	review while the patent is in force. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension
	cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug may
	be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, provided that statutory and regulatory requirements are met. Thus, in the future, if and
	when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and
	other factors. The expiration dates of our patents and patent applications referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90%

	Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These
	pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will
	not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before
	approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.

	In addition, as a condition of
	approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the
	FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new
	molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing
	or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment
	of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other
	drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with
	the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#146;s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the
	sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time
	period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by
	data emerging in the clinical trial process.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or
	FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as &#147;breakthrough therapies.&#148; A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination
	with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically
	significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development
	process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the
	clinical trials in an efficient manner.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious
	condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available
	therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance
	that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten
	the FDA&#146;s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to
	patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug when the product has
	an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical
	benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those
	granted traditional approval.

	therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that
	such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is
	reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.

	The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in
	which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated
	approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course
	requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.

	The accelerated approval pathway is
	usually contingent on a sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug&#146;s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject
	to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit
	during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

	In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as
	drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic

	Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is
	identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is &#147;bioequivalent&#148; to the
	innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#147;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is &#147;therapeutically equivalent&#148; to the RLD in its
	publication &#147;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#148; also referred to as the &#147;Orange Book.&#148; Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the
	RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#146;s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the
	prescribing physician or patient.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of
	non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. A new chemical entity is a drug that contains no active moiety that has
	previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be
	filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also
	provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the
	approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.

	The FDA has designated ridinilazole as a qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP, under the Generating Antibiotic
	Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act. Congress passed this legislation to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections. To that end, the GAIN Act grants an
	additional five years of exclusivity upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product designated by the FDA as a QIDP. Thus, for a QIDP, the periods of five-year new chemical entity exclusivity, three-year new clinical investigation exclusivity and
	seven-year orphan drug exclusivity, would become ten years, eight years and 12 years, respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A QIDP is defined in the GAIN Act to
	mean &#147;an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by&#151;(1)&nbsp;an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious
	pathogens;&#148; or (2)&nbsp;certain &#147;qualifying pathogens.&#148; A &#147;qualifying pathogen&#148; is a pathogen that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health (such as resistant gram positive pathogens, multi-drug resistant
	gram negative bacteria, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and
<I>
	Clostridium difficile
</I>
	) and that is included in a list established and maintained by the FDA. A drug sponsor may request the FDA to designate its product as a QIDP any time before
	the submission of an NDA. The FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of the designation request. A product designated as a QIDP will be granted priority review by FDA and can qualify for &#147;fast track&#148; status.

	The additional five years of exclusivity under the GAIN Act&nbsp;for drug products designated by the FDA as QIDPs applies only to a drug that
	is first approved on or after July&nbsp;9, 2012. Additionally, the five year exclusivity extension does not apply to: a supplement to an application under FDCA Section&nbsp;505(b) for any QIDP for which an extension is in effect or has expired; a
	subsequent application filed with respect to a product approved by the FDA for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength; or a product that does not
	meet the definition of a QIDP under Section&nbsp;505(g) based upon its approved uses.

	The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a PMA may also be eligible for patent
	term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided that certain statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in
	force. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product
	approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions
	to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, provided that statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the centralized authorization procedure, the EMA&#146;s Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, serves as the scientific
	committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products for human use on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state&#146;s national authority for medicinal products, with
	expert appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the Committee acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout
	its life cycle. The CHMP has 210&nbsp;days to adopt an opinion as to whether a marketing authorization should be granted. The process usually takes longer in case additional information is requested, which triggers clock-stops in the procedural
	timelines. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug that is of major
	interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the applicant may pursuant to Article 14(9) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 request an accelerated assessment procedure. If the CHMP accepts
	such request, the time-limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time-limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated
	assessment. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report, or EPAR, is produced. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion,
	a decision on the MAA must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the E.U. member states, which in total can take more than 60 days.

	The European Commission, following an evaluation by the EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, has designated ezutromid as an
	orphan medicinal product (EU orphan designation number: EU/3/08/591). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;847/2000, the European Commission can grant such orphan medicinal product designation to products for which
	the sponsor can establish that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union, or a life threatening,
	seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would generate a sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. In

	Orphan drug designation is not a marketing authorization. It is a designation that provides a number of benefits, including
	fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized E.U. marketing authorization, as well as ten years of market exclusivity following a marketing authorization. During this market exclusivity period, neither the
	EMA, the European Commission nor the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a &#147;similar medicinal product.&#148; A &#147;similar medicinal product&#148; is defined as a medicinal product containing a
	similar active substance or substances as those contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product and that is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may be reduced to
	six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In
	addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the already
	approved orphan drug. Furthermore, a product can lose orphan designation, and the related benefits, prior to us obtaining a marketing authorization if it is demonstrated that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met.

	In order to compensate the patentee for delays in obtaining a marketing authorization for a patented product, a supplementary certificate, or
	SPC, may be granted extending the exclusivity period for that specific product by up to five years. Applications for SPCs must be made to the relevant patent office in each E.U. member state and the granted certificates are valid only in the member
	state of grant. An application has to be made by the patent owner within six months of the first marketing authorization being granted in the European Union (assuming the patent in question has not expired, lapsed or been revoked) or within six
	months of the grant of the patent (if the marketing authorization is granted first). In the context of SPCs, the term &#147;product&#148; means the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients for a medicinal product and the term
	&#147;patent&#148; means a patent protecting such a product or a new manufacturing process or application for it. The duration of an SPC is calculated as the difference between the patent&#146;s filing date and the date of the first marketing

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities.
	Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and
	managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is
	approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a
	priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including
	price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and
	measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be
	approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory
	approvals. A payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an
	appropriate return on investment in product development.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from
	country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our drug candidate
	to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for
	which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or
	indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to
	physicians to limit prescriptions. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a

	reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference
	pricing used by various E.U. member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We were founded in 2003 and are
	incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with the Registrar of Companies of England and Wales, United Kingdom. Our principal offices are located in the United Kingdom. Our ordinary shares have traded on AIM, which is a sub-market of the
	London Stock Exchange, since October 2004 and our American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, have traded on the NASDAQ Global Market since March 2015. Our historic business activities have included the research and development of drug candidates across a
	number of disease areas. We have also in the past provided drug discovery services to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. However, we sold these drug discovery services businesses in 2009 as part of a broader restructuring initiative
	to focus on identifying and developing medicines in a range of major therapy areas. In 2012, we made a strategic decision to further refine our business focus and concentrate on the development of our clinical stage programs for DMD and CDI, in
	order to more efficiently capitalize on the scientific and commercial potential of these programs. Accordingly, we discontinued our in-house discovery efforts relating to the development of an iminosugar technology platform. We expanded our future
	generation utrophin modulator pipeline effort in November 2013 through the formation of a strategic alliance with the University of Oxford. As part of this transaction, we acquired an exclusive option to license intellectual property that is
	generated as part of our research with the University of Oxford in utrophin modulation. In 2014, we opened an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in order to strengthen our presence in the United States. We expect to undertake a significant
	proportion of our future development efforts for our clinical programs in the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To date, we have financed our operations
	primarily through the issuance of our ordinary shares and American Depositary Shares and development funding and other assistance from government entities, philanthropic, non-government and not for profit organizations and patient advocacy groups
	for our product candidates. In particular, we have received funding from the Wellcome Trust, Innovate UK, Joining Jack, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Charley&#146;s Fund, Cure Duchenne, Foundation to
	Eradicate Duchenne and the Nash Avery Foundation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have generated losses since inception. Our net loss was approximately
	&pound;17.1&nbsp;million for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2016, &pound;11.3&nbsp;million for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2015 and &pound;6.1&nbsp;million for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2014. As of January&nbsp;31, 2016, we had an
	accumulated deficit of &pound;47.3 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years in connection with conducting clinical trials for our lead product candidates, ezutromid
	(formerly SMT C1100) for the treatment of DMD and ridinilazole (formerly SMT19969) for the treatment of CDI, and seeking marketing approval for ezutromid and ridinilazole in the United States and the European Union as well as other geographies. In
	addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval for ezutromid, ridinilazole or any of our future product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, distribution and outsourced
	manufacturing. We also incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company in the United States in addition to in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations. Adequate
	additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any
	future commercialization efforts.

	Other operating

	government entities, including Innovate UK. In October 2012, we entered into a translation award funding agreement with the Wellcome Trust to support Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of ridinilazole for the treatment of CDI. We are eligible to
	receive up to &pound;4.0&nbsp;million from the Wellcome Trust under this award, of which we have received &pound;3.9 million. This award followed an award funding agreement we entered into with the Wellcome Trust in October 2009, under which we
	received &pound;2.3 million. In September 2013, we entered into an agreement with Innovate UK for funding of up to &pound;2.4&nbsp;million to support development of ezutromid, of which we have received &pound;1.7&nbsp;million by January&nbsp;31,

	certain preclinical programs on a per project basis. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as compared to prior periods as we initiate and continue clinical trials of ezutromid for the treatment of DMD and
	ridinilazole for the treatment of CDI and continue our research activities and initiate preclinical programs for future product candidates. The timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the outcome of our ongoing clinical trials and the
	costs associated with our planned clinical trials. The timing and amount of these expenses will also depend on the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our product candidates and the related expansion of our research and
	development organization, regulatory requirements, advancement of our preclinical programs and product candidate manufacturing costs.

	As a

	not consider it probable that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future based on the evidence available. As a company that carries out extensive research and development activities, we benefit from the U.K. research and
	development tax credit regime and are able to surrender some of our trading losses that arise from our research and development activities for a cash rebate ranging from 8.67% to 33.23% of eligible research and development expenditure. In the event
	we generate revenues in the future, we may benefit from the new &#147;patent box&#148; initiative that allows profits attributable to revenues from patents or patented products to be taxed at a lower rate than other revenue. This relief applies to
	profits earned from April&nbsp;1, 2013 and following the transitional arrangements that will phase in the relief, the rate of tax for relevant streams of revenue for companies receiving this relief will be 10%.

	Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which
	we have prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. In the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily
	apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
	Our estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revisions and future
	periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

	we consider that such arrangements are most similar to government grants. As such, we recognize amounts received from philanthropic, non-government and not for profit organizations and patient
	advocacy groups and grant income from government entities as other operating income in accordance with International Accounting Standard 20, &#147;Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance,&#148; at the same time as
	the underlying expenditure is incurred, provided that there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the conditions of such awards. Under the terms of certain of our arrangements with philanthropic, nongovernment and not for profit
	organizations and patient advocacy groups, should we successfully commercialize our products, we have agreed to enter into certain revenue sharing agreements, under which those organizations will be entitled to a share of the cumulative net revenue
	that we or our affiliates receive from exploiting the relevant intellectual property or award products. We will recognize these royalties as a reduction in revenue in line with any potential future sales made by us. In addition, if we achieve
	certain milestones, we are obligated to make milestone payments to such organizations. We currently disclose these potential future royalty and milestone payment obligations as a contingent liability in our consolidated financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We recognize expenses incurred in carrying out our research and development activities in line with our best estimation of the stage of
	completion of each separately contracted study or activity. This includes the calculation of research and development accruals at each period to account for expenditure that has been incurred. This requires estimations of the full costs to complete
	each study or activity and also estimation of the current stage of completion. There have been no material adjustments to estimates based on the actual costs incurred for the periods presented. In all cases, we expense the full cost of each study or
	activity by the time the final study report or, where applicable, product, has been received.

	We will recognize an internally-generated
	intangible asset arising from our development activities only when an asset is created that can be identified, it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and the development cost of the asset can be measured
	reliably. We have determined that regulatory approval is the earliest point at which the probable threshold for the creation of an internally generated intangible asset can be achieved. We therefore expense all research and development expenditure
	incurred prior to achieving regulatory approval as it is incurred. None of our product candidates have yet received regulatory approval.

	We measure share options at fair value at their grant date in accordance with IFRS 2, &#147;Stock-based Payment.&#148; We
	calculate the fair value of the share option using either the Black-Scholes model, or for options with performance conditions, a simulation model. We charge the fair value to the income statement over the expected vesting period. In the case of
	options that are issued below market value, the fair value will be higher than an option granted at market value, and we recognize a larger charge for such options in the income statement.

	We review annually whether

	of cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations which will be incurred in selling the unit. These calculations require the use of estimates; the nature of the estimates used in impairment testing as of
	January&nbsp;31, 2016 and January&nbsp;31, 2015 are presented in the notes to the financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report.

	award &pound;1.4&nbsp;million was outstanding as of January&nbsp;31, 2015. The increase in government grant income was offset by a decrease in other operating income recognized from the Wellcome Trust, which decreased by &pound;0.2&nbsp;million to

	our DMD program increased by &pound;1.8&nbsp;million to &pound;4.7&nbsp;million from &pound;2.9&nbsp;million for the year ended January&nbsp;31, 2014. This increase included &pound;0.8&nbsp;million related to our ezutromid clinical activities,

	2014. This increase was due to a &pound;0.8&nbsp;million increase in staffing costs and a &pound;0.2&nbsp;million increase in the share-based payment charge allocated to research and development expenses, which resulted from increased employee
	headcount within our DMD and CDI program teams. These amounts were partially offset by a reduction in other non-core program costs of &pound;0.1&nbsp;million due to the discontinuation of our in-house discovery efforts related to the development of

	Since our

	increase in connection with conducting clinical trials for our lead product candidates, ezutromid for the treatment of DMD and ridinilazole for the treatment of CDI, and seeking marketing approval for ezutromid and ridinilazole in the United States
	and the European Union as well as other geographies. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional financings, research funding, collaborations, contract and grant revenue or other sources.
	Additional capital, when needed, may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.

	agreed to fund a drug research and discovery program in the University of Oxford laboratories to identify and research utrophin modulators to treat DMD. The University of Oxford is responsible for conducting this program. Isis has no obligations

	Unless the board
	determines otherwise, the vesting of an award granted under the Incentive Plan is subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition. Subject to the terms of the Incentive Plan that apply upon a cessation of a participant&#146;s employment and
	upon certain corporate events, the performance condition will be measured over the performance period which, unless the board determines otherwise, will be at least three years. Performance conditions may be amended or substituted by the board if
	one or more events occur which cause the board to consider that an amended or substituted performance condition would be more appropriate and would not be materially less difficult to satisfy than the original performance condition to which the
	award was subject.

	As soon as reasonably practicable after the end of the performance period relating to an award that is subject to a
	performance condition, our board will determine if and to what extent the performance condition has been satisfied. To the extent that the performance condition has not been satisfied in full, the remainder of the award will lapse immediately.
	Subject to the terms of the Incentive Plan that apply upon a cessation of a participant&#146;s employment and upon certain corporate events, an award that is subject to a performance condition will vest on the later of the date on which the board
	determines that the performance condition has been satisfied and the third anniversary of the date of grant of the award (or such other date determined by the board and communicated to the participant). An award that is not subject to the
	satisfaction of a performance condition will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant (or such other date determined by the board and communicated to the participant). We refer to the date on which an award would normally vest, whether or
	not it is subject to the achievement of a performance condition, as the normal vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there are share dealing restrictions (imposed by the company&#146;s share dealing code, the rules of the London Stock
	Exchange, or any other applicable laws or regulations) on the applicable normal vesting date, the award will vest on the date the dealing restrictions are lifted.

	The Incentive Plan provides that if a participant dies prior to the date on which an award vests, a number of shares subject to such award
	will, unless the board determines otherwise, vest as soon as practicable following the participant&#146;s death. The number of shares that vest in such circumstance will depend, unless the board determines otherwise, on the extent to which any
	applicable performance condition has been satisfied at the date of death and the period of time that has elapsed since the start of the applicable performance period or, if the award is not subject to a performance condition, since the date of grant
	of the award, or such other period as the board determines. To the extent that an award does not vest in full, the remainder will lapse immediately.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our 2005 EMI Scheme Rules were adopted on December&nbsp;1, 2005. Under the scheme we may grant enterprise management incentive options, known
	as approved options, to those eligible bona fide employees and directors who qualify under applicable U.K. tax law and, to the extent that our employees and directors do not qualify for approved options, unapproved options may be granted to such
	eligible bona fide employees and directors.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Vesting of options is subject to such performance conditions as shall be set out in the agreement granting an option pursuant to the scheme and
	shall be otherwise determined by the board in accordance with the scheme. An approved option must be capable of being exercised within the period of ten years from the date of grant. Performance conditions may be amended, relaxed or waived by us if
	an event occurs which would cause us to consider that an amended performance condition would be a fairer measure of performance provided that such amended targets are no more and no less difficult to satisfy than they were prior to amendment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Generally, options must be exercised while the participant is an eligible employee or director. In the event, however, that a participant
	ceases to be an eligible employee or director as a result of ill-health, injury, or disability; redundancy, retirement or pregnancy; upon the company for which the participant works ceasing to be a member of our group; or the transfer of an
	undertaking or part-undertaking in which the participant is employed to a company not in our group, the option may be exercised during the period commencing on the date he ceases to be an eligible employee or director and ending on 12 months
	thereafter. If a participant dies while he is an eligible employee or director, the participant&#146;s personal representatives may exercise the option for 12 months after the participant&#146;s death. All options lapse in prescribed circumstances,
	including: upon the tenth anniversary of the date of grant; the expiry of the period (if any) allowed for the satisfaction of any performance condition without such condition having been satisfied or becomes, in our opinion, incapable of being
	satisfied; on the day on which a participant ceases to be an eligible employee or director (with the exception of the carve outs detailed in the scheme); on the bankruptcy of the participant; or on the occurrence of a takeover.

	non-executive directors on an annual basis. For 2016 our board will revert to its previous policy whereby all directors will offer themselves for re-election by rotation, with every director doing so at least once every three years. Accordingly we
	plan to put one-third of the directors up for re-election at the 2016 annual general meeting. The Board considers a classified board structure and the practice of retiring by rotation every three years to be appropriate given that, as a

	capital losses in that or any earlier tax year and the level of the annual exemption for tax-free gains in that tax year (the &#147;annual exemption&#148;). The annual exemption for the 2016/2017 tax year is &pound;11,100. If, after all allowable

	received by non-corporate U.S. holders (
<I>

	corporations&#148; to non-corporate U.S. holders that meet the applicable requirements, including a minimum holding period (generally, at least 61 days without protection from the risk of loss during the 121-day period beginning 60&nbsp;days before
	the ex-dividend date). A non-United States corporation (other than a corporation that is classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year) generally will be considered to be a qualified foreign
	corporation (a)&nbsp;if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States which the Secretary of Treasury of the United States determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and which includes an
	exchange of information provision, or (b)&nbsp;with respect to any dividend it pays on shares of stock which are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Our ADSs are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, which is an
	established securities market in the United States, and we expect the ADSs to be readily tradable on the NASDAQ Global Market. However, there can be no assurance that the ADSs will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market
	in the United States in later years. The Company, which is incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom, believes that it qualifies as a resident of the United Kingdom for the purposes of, and is eligible for the benefits of, the Convention
	between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and
	Capital Gains, signed on July&nbsp;24, 2001, or the U.S.-U.K. Tax Treaty, although there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, the IRS has determined that the U.S.-U.K. Tax Treaty is satisfactory for purposes of the qualified dividend rules
	and that it includes an exchange-of-information program. Based on the foregoing, we expect to be considered a qualified foreign corporation under the Code. Accordingly, dividends paid by us to non-corporate U.S. holders with respect to shares that
	meet the minimum holding period and other requirements are expected to be treated as &#147;qualified dividend income.&#148; However, dividends paid by us will not qualify for the 20% maximum U.S. federal income tax rate if we are treated, for the

	backup withholding (at a 28% rate) on such payments, unless the U.S. holder provides a taxpayer identification number and a duly executed IRS Form&nbsp;W-9 or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and the
	amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

	January&nbsp;1, 2017, if such payments are not exempt from such withholding. The Company believes, and this discussion assumes, that the Company is not a &#147;foreign financial institution&#148; for purposes of FATCA. The rules regarding FATCA and

	in the United States and the translation for foreign bank accounts. We monitor our exposure to foreign exchange risk. Exposures are generally managed through natural hedging via the currency denomination of cash balances and any impact currently is

	March&nbsp;10, 2015, we completed the sale of 3,450,000 ADSs in our IPO at a price to the public of $9.90 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of $28.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.4 million and offering
	expenses of $3.8 million. In addition, we granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 517,500 additional ADSs to cover over allotments, at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. On March&nbsp;18, 2015, we completed
	the additional sale of 517,500 ADSs under this option at a price to the public of $9.90 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of $4.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.4 million. The offering commenced on
	March&nbsp;4, 2015 and did not terminate until we had completed the sale of all of the securities registered in the offering. None of the underwriting discounts and commissions or other offering expenses were paid to directors or officers of ours or
	their associates or to persons owning 10% or more of any class of our equity securities or to any affiliates of ours. JMP Securities LLC, Oppenheimer&nbsp;&amp; Co. Inc. and Needham&nbsp;&amp; Company, LLC were the underwriters for our IPO.

	&#147;disclosure controls and procedures,&#148; as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be
	disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s rules and
	forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of
	1934 is accumulated and communicated to the company&#146;s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the
	effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only
	provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January&nbsp;31, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such
	date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance.

	To the board of directors and shareholders of Summit Therapeutics plc:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, cash flows, and
	changes in equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Summit Therapeutics plc and its subsidiaries at January&nbsp;31, 2016 and January&nbsp;31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
	of the three years in the period ended January&nbsp;31, 2016, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
	Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
	(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
	reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred significant losses and
	negative cash flows from operations since inception, has an accumulated deficit, and has limited cash resources. Management&#146;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The share-based payment
	reserve arises as the expense of issuing share-based payments is recognized over time (share option grants). The reserve will fall as share options vest and are exercised, and the impact of the subsequent dilution of earnings crystallises, but the

	The merger reserve brought forward relates to the difference between the nominal value of Summit (Oxford) Limited arising from the Group reconstruction in
	2004, accounted for using the merger method of accounting under U.K.&nbsp;GAAP, and the amount arising through application of S131 CA85, which is equal to the difference between nominal and fair value of shares issued in business combinations using

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (&#145;IFRS&#146;) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (&#145;IASB&#146;) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting
	under IFRS. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention. These consolidated financial statements were authorized by the Board of Directors on May&nbsp;10, 2016.

	Going concern
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These financial statements have been
	prepared assuming the Group will continue on a going-concern basis. The Group has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, has an accumulated deficit, and has limited cash resources. Based on management
	forecasts, the Group&#146;s existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable the Group to fund the operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for its major programs up until January&nbsp;31, 2017, following which the
	Group needs to raise additional capital to continue to fund its future operations, which may come from a public or private fund raising. There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to generate funds in this manner, on terms acceptable to
	the Group, on a timely basis or at all. The failure of the Group to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Group&#146;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The
	financial statements do not contain any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Use of estimates

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The preparation of the financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, requires the use of estimates and assumptions that
	affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management&#146;s best knowledge of
	the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The areas involving higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements
	are disclosed in Note 2, &#145;Critical accounting estimates and judgements&#146;.

	Other operating income primarily consists of amounts received from philanthropic, non-government and not-for-profit organisations, and patient advocacy groups,
	and income received from the Wellcome Trust. Because IFRS does not provide specific accounting guidance for the treatment of amounts received from such organisations, the Group considers that such arrangements are most similar to government grants.
	Accordingly, these amounts are recognized as other operating income in accordance with International Accounting Standard 20, &#145;Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance,&#146; at the same time as the underlying
	expenditure is incurred, provided that there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions of such awards. The monies received through these means have historically been held as deferred income in the Consolidated Statement
	of Financial Position and were released to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as the expenditure is incurred. Income received from the Wellcome Trust was in an accrued position at the year end.

	debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the year end date, which are classified as non-current assets. Other liabilities consist of trade and other
	payables, being balances arising in the course of normal business with suppliers, contractors and other service providers, and borrowings, being loans and hire purchase funds advanced for the refit of leasehold premises and the purchase of
	laboratory equipment, fixtures and fittings. Loans and receivables, and other liabilities are initially recorded at fair value, and thereafter at amortised cost, if the timing difference is deemed to impact the fair value of the asset or liability.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets,

	Other operating income primarily consists of amounts received from philanthropic, non-government and not for profit organisations and patient advocacy groups,
	and the Wellcome Trust. Because IFRS does not provide specific accounting guidance for the treatment of amounts received from such organisations, the Group considers that such arrangements are most similar to government grants. Accordingly, these
	amounts are recognized as other operating income in accordance with International Accounting Standard 20, &#145;Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance,&#146; at the same time as the underlying expenditure is
	incurred, provided that there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions of such awards.

	Under the terms of the various

	revenue that the Group or its affiliates receive from exploiting the relevant IP or award products. These royalties will be recognized as a reduction in revenue in line with any potential future sales made by the Group. In addition, should certain
	millstones be achieved, the Group will be obligated to make the milestone payments to certain such organisations. Both potential and future royalty and milestone payment obligations are disclosed as a contingent liability in Note 16,
	&#145;Provisions for other liabilities and charges and contingent liabilities&#146;.

	On November&nbsp;22, 2013 the

	The MuOx transaction was concluded through a number of agreements with the

	the payments are additional consideration, employee compensation or research services. All such payments were assessed as either employee compensation or research services and will be expensed in the post-acquisition period as incurred.
