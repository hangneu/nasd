	subsets of RPGs, with MMORPGs emphasizing the interaction of a large number of players and ARPGs emphasizing real-time action where a player has direct control over characters and enjoys various forms of combat systems. TPSs are third person shooter
	games that are structured around shooting, where a player can see and control an avatar on-screen in a third-person view. CCGs are collectible card games in which players collect cards and compete to win by using card sets with different functions.

	The Internet and Internet-related markets in China are rapidly evolving. We believe the rapid increase in China&#146;s online population will draw more
	attention to the PRC Internet market from both domestic and multinational competitors. Our existing competitors may in the future achieve greater market acceptance and gain additional market share. It is also possible that new competitors may emerge
	and acquire significant market share. In addition, our competitors may leverage their existing Internet platforms to cross-sell newly launched products and services. It is also possible that, as a result of deficiencies in legal protections afforded
	intellectual property in the Internet industry in China, or inadequate enforcement of existing PRC laws protecting such intellectual property, we may not be able to prevent existing or new competitors from accessing and using our in-house developed
	Web content or technologies.

	In recent years there have emerged three large conglomerates, Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu, Inc. (&#147;Baidu&#148;), that
	have a wide reach in the Internet industry in China, and between them tend to dominate key aspects of the industry through their own operations or through strategic investments in other companies. Each of these companies is in a position to compete
	very effectively against us. For example, Alibaba alone competes with us in almost every key aspect of our business, competing with us in media through its investment in Sina Corporation (&#147;Sina&#148;); in online video through its investment in,
	and pending acquisition of 100% of, Youku Tudou Inc. (&#147;Youku Tudou&#148;); and in online search through its subsidiary UCWeb Inc. (&#147;UCWeb).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
<I>
	Telecommunications Regulations of the People&#146;s Republic of China (&#147;Telecom Regulations&#148;)
</I>
	, implemented on September&nbsp;25, 2000 and
	amended on July&nbsp;29, 2014, are the primary PRC law governing telecommunication services, and set out the general framework for the provision of telecommunication services by domestic PRC companies. The Telecom Regulations require that
	telecommunications service providers procure operating licenses prior to commencing operations. The Telecom Regulations draw a distinction between &#147;basic telecommunications services,&#148; which we generally do not provide, and
	&#147;value-added telecommunications services.&#148; The Telecom Regulations define value-added telecommunications services as telecommunications and information services provided through public networks. The
<I>
	Catalogue of Telecommunications
	Business (&#147;Catalogue&#148;),
</I>
	which was issued as an attachment to the Telecom Regulations and updated in February 2003, identifies online data and transaction processing, on-demand voice and image communications, domestic Internet virtual
	private networks, Internet data centers, message storage and forwarding (including voice mailbox, e-mail and online fax services), call centers, Internet access, and online information and data search as value-added telecommunications services. We
	engage in various types of business activities that are value-added telecommunications services as defined and described by the Telecom Regulations and the Catalogue.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On March&nbsp;1, 2009, the MIIT issued the
<I>
	Measures on the Administration of Telecommunications Business Operating Permits (the &#147;Telecom License
	Measures&#148;)
</I>
	, which became effective on April&nbsp;10, 2009, to supplement the Telecom Regulations and replace the previous
<I>
	Administrative Measures for Telecommunications Business Operating Licenses.
</I>
	The Telecom License Measures
	confirm that there are two types of telecom operating licenses for operators in China, one for basic telecommunications services and one for value-added telecommunications services. A distinction is also made as to whether a license is granted for
	&#147;intra-provincial&#148; or &#147;trans-regional&#148; (inter-provincial) activities. An appendix to each license granted will detail the permitted activities of the enterprise to which it was granted. An approved telecommunication services
	operator must conduct its business (whether basic or value-added) in accordance with the specifications recorded in its Telecommunications Services Operating License.

	notice stating that China mobile network operators may only provide mobile network access to those mobile Internet service providers which have obtained licenses from the relevant local arm of the MIIT before conducting operations. On the basis of
	the notice, China Mobile has required each of its mobile Internet service providers to first obtain a license for trans-regional value-added telecommunications services in order to gain full access to its mobile network, which is a nationwide policy
	in line with a similar notice issued by the Beijing branch of China Mobile on April&nbsp;12, 2004.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Various PRC regulations currently restrict foreign-invested entities from engaging in value-added telecommunication services, including providing Internet
	information services and operating online games. Foreign direct investment in telecommunications companies in China is regulated by the
<I>
	Regulations for the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises (&#147;FITE
	Regulations&#148;)
</I>
	, which were issued by the PRC State Council, or State Council, on December&nbsp;11, 2001, became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2002 and were amended on September&nbsp;10, 2008. The FITE Regulations stipulate that foreign
	invested telecommunications enterprises in the PRC (&#147;FITEs&#148;) must be established as Sino-foreign equity joint ventures. Under the FITE Regulations and in accordance with WTO-related agreements, the foreign party to a FITE engaging in
	value-added telecommunications services may hold up to 50% of the equity of the FITE, with no geographic restrictions on its operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For a FITE to
	acquire any equity interest in a value-added telecommunications business in China, it must satisfy a number of stringent performance and operational experience requirements, including demonstrating a track record and experience in operating a
	value-added telecommunications business overseas. FITEs that meet these requirements must obtain approvals from the MIIT and the MOFCOM or their authorized local counterparts, which retain considerable discretion in granting approvals.

	On July&nbsp;13, 2006, the MIIT issued the
<I>
	Notice of the Ministry of Information Industry on Intensifying the
	Administration of Foreign Investment in Value-added Telecommunications Services (the &#147;MIIT Notice&#148;),
</I>
	which reiterates certain provisions of the FITE Regulations. Under the MIIT Notice, if a FITE intends to invest in a PRC value-added
	telecommunications business, the FITE must be established and must apply for a telecommunications business license applicable to the business. Under the MIIT Notice, a domestic company that holds a license for the provision of Internet content
	services, or an ICP license, is considered to be a type of value-added telecommunications business in China, and is prohibited from leasing, transferring or selling the license to foreign investors in any form, and from providing any assistance,
	including providing resources, sites or facilities, to foreign investors to conduct value-added telecommunications businesses illegally in China. Trademarks and domain names that are used in the provision of Internet content services must be owned
	by the ICP license holder. The MIIT Notice requires each ICP license holder to have appropriate facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added
	telecommunications service providers are required to maintain network and information security in accordance with standards set forth in relevant PRC regulations. Our VIEs, rather than our subsidiaries, hold ICP licenses, own our domain names, and
	hold or have applied for registration in the PRC of trademarks related to our business and own and maintain facilities that we believe are appropriate for our business operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In view of these restrictions on foreign direct investment in the value-added telecommunications sector, we established or acquired several domestic VIEs to
	engage in value-added telecommunications services. For a detailed discussion of our VIEs, please refer to &#147;Our Corporate Structure&#148; above. Due to a lack of interpretative materials from the relevant PRC authorities, there are uncertainties
	regarding whether PRC authorities would consider our corporate structure and contractual arrangements to constitute foreign ownership of a value-added telecommunications business. See &#147;Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure.&#148; In order to
	comply with PRC regulatory requirements, we operate our main business through companies with which we have contractual relationships but in which we do not have an actual ownership interest. If our current ownership structure is found to be in
	violation of current or future PRC laws, rules or regulations regarding the legality of foreign investment in the PRC Internet sector, we could be subject to severe penalties.

	In the opinion of Haiwen, subject to the uncertainties and risks disclosed elsewhere in this report under the heading &#147;Risk Factors&#148; and

	such sites must hold, or have a license to, the copyright to all content that they transmit. In addition, the March 2009 SAPPRFT notice stipulates that only those films or TV programs that have already obtained from the SAPPRFT a Film Public
	Screening Permit, TV Drama Distribution Permit, TV Animation Distribution Permit, or TV Documentary Film Screening Permit are allowed to be transmitted via audiovisual Websites. These permits are mandatory for all films and programs shown on TV and
	in cinemas in China and must be obtained before such film or TV or program is allowed to be released. The approval applications for the Film Public Screening Permit, Television Drama Distribution Permit, Television Animation Distribution Permit or
	Television Documentary Film Screening Permit are extremely difficult and time-consuming, and the SAPPRFT previously did not enforce very strictly the requirements regarding these permits. However, on September&nbsp;2, 2014, the SAPPRFT issued a

	Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Online Foreign Audiovisual Content

	Permit, TV Drama Distribution Permit, or TV Animation Distribution Permit for all foreign films and TV dramas before they are transmitted via the Internet in China. The September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice further stipulates that before any foreign films
	or TV dramas for transmission exclusively via the Internet are purchased after the promulgation of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice, operators of audiovisual Websites must declare their annual purchasing plans with the SAPPRFT before the end of the
	year preceding the year of the intended broadcast and obtain the SAPPRFT&#146;s approval. The September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice also states that the number of foreign films and TV dramas to be purchased by an operator and transmitted via its Website in
	a single year may not exceed 30% of the total amount of the Chinese films and TV dramas purchased and transmitted by the same Website in the previous year.

<I>
	Rules for the Administration of Electronic Publications
</I>
	(the &#147;Electronic Publication Rules&#148;), which were amended on August&nbsp;28, 2015. The Electronic Publication Rules regulate the production, publishing and importation of electronic publications in the PRC and outline a licensing system for
	business operations involving electronic publishing. Under the Electronic Publication Rules and other related regulations issued by the SAPPRFT, online games are classified as a type of electronic publication or Internet publication that may only be
	provided by a licensed electronic publishing entity with a standard publication code, and establishment of an electronic publishing entity must be approved by the SAPPRFT. Electronic publishing entities are responsible for assuring that the content
	of electronic publications comply with relevant PRC law and regulations, and must obtain the approval of the SAPPRFT before publishing foreign electronic publications. The
<I>
	Tentative Measures for Internet Publication Administration
</I>
	(&#147;Internet Publication Measures&#148;), which were jointly promulgated by the SAPPRFT and the MIIT and became effective in 2002, impose a license requirement for any company that intends to engage in Internet publishing, which is defined as
	any act by an ICP to select, edit and process content or programs and to make such content or programs publicly available on the Internet. As the provision of online games is deemed to be an Internet publication activity, an online game operator
	must obtain an Internet publishing license and an authorization codes for each of its games in operation in order to directly make those games publicly available in the PRC. Although the Internet Publication Measures do not specifically authorize
	such a practice, an online game operator is generally able to publish its games and obtain authorization codes for those games through third-party licensed electronic publishing entities and register the games with the SAPPRFT as electronic
	publications. The New Internet Publication Measures issued by the SAPPRFT and the MIIT, which will become effective on March&nbsp;10, 2016 and will replace the Internet Publication Measures, require that entities in the Internet publishing business
	apply for a new online publication license and obtain approval from the SAPPRFT prior to the publication of new online games. In addition, under the New Internet Publication Measures Sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign-invested entities are not
	permitted to engage in Internet publication services, and the legal representative of an entity providing Internet publication services may not be a foreigner. As the New Internet Publication Measures are new and have not yet become effective, the

	historically published through third parties that were licensed electronic publishing entities, because Gamease had not obtained an Internet publishing license at the time those online games were made publicly available. TLBB, BO, BH2, and certain
	of Changyou&#146;s other existing games are currently published under an Internet publishing license held by Gamease. Current PRC regulations are not clear as to the consequences of obtaining authorization codes through third-party electronic
	publishing entities. While we believe that arrangements like Changyou&#146;s are acknowledged by the SAPPRFT, in view of the lack of formal interpretation regarding this issue, the SAPPRFT might challenge Changyou&#146;s current and past practices
	and could subject Changyou to various penalties, including fines, confiscation of publishing equipment and the revenues generated from the publishing activities, the revocation of Changyou&#146;s business license, or the forced discontinuation of or

	The Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Games (&#147;Online Game Measures&#148;), issued by the
	MOC, which took effect on August&nbsp;1, 2010, regulate a broad range of activities related to the online games business, including the development, production and operation of online games, the issuance of virtual currencies used for online games,
	and the provision of virtual currency trading services. The Online Game Measures provide that any entity that is engaged in online game operations must obtain an Online Culture Operating Permit, and require the content of an imported online game to
	be examined and approved by the MOC prior to the game&#146;s launch and a domestic online game to be filed with the MOC within 30 days after its launch. The Notice of the Ministry of Culture on the Implementation of the Interim Measures for the
	Administration of Online Games, which was issued by the MOC on July&nbsp;29, 2010 to implement the Online Game Measures, (i)&nbsp;requires online game operators to protect the interests of online game users and specify certain terms that must be
	included in service agreements between online game operators and the users of their online games, (ii)&nbsp;specifies content review of imported online games and filing procedures for domestic online games, (iii)&nbsp;emphasizes the protection of
	minors playing online games and (iv)&nbsp;requests online game operators to promote real-name registration by their game users. Changyou has filed its games TLBB, BO, BH2, and certain of its other existing games with the MOC. If Changyou fails to
	maintain any of its permits, approvals or registrations, to make any necessary filings, or to apply for and obtain any required new permits, approvals or registrations or make any new filings on a timely basis, it may be subject to various
	penalties, including fines and a requirement that it discontinue or limit its operations.

	issuance of new Internet caf&eacute; licenses. Though this nationwide suspension was generally lifted in 2005, local authorities have the authority in their discretion to control the number of new licenses and determine the recipients of new
	licenses. In addition, local and higher-level governmental authorities may from time to time strictly enforce customer age limits and other requirements relating to Internet caf&eacute;s, as a result of the occurrence of, and media attention on,
	gang fights, arson or other incidents in or related to Internet caf&eacute;s. On February&nbsp;15, 2007, the MOC and other relevant government authorities jointly issued the

	investigating and punishing the Internet caf&eacute;s which accept minors, cracking down on Internet caf&eacute;s without sufficient and valid licenses, limiting the total number of Internet caf&eacute;s, screening unlawful games and Websites, and

	three hours or less of continuous play by minors is considered to be &#147;healthy,&#148; three to five hours to be &#147;fatiguing,&#148; and five hours or more to be &#147;unhealthy.&#148; Game operators are required to reduce the value of in-game

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To
	identify whether a game player is a minor and thus subject to the anti-fatigue system, there was adopted a real-name registration system, which requires online game players to register their real identity information before they play online games
	and requires us to submit the identity information of game players to the public security authorities for verification. On July&nbsp;1, 2011, the SAPPRFT, the MIIT, the Ministry of Education and five other governmental authorities issued
<I>
	a Notice
	on Initializing the verification of Real-name Registration for Anti-Fatigue System on Internet Game

	s (&#147;Real-name Registration Notice&#148;), to strengthen the implementation of the anti-fatigue system and real-name registration, which took
	effect on October&nbsp;1, 2011. The Real-name Registration Notice&#146;s main focus is to prevent minors from using an adult&#146;s ID to play Internet games and, accordingly, the notice imposes stringent punishments on online game operators that do
	not implement the required anti-fatigue and real-name registration measures properly and effectively. The most severe punishment contemplated by the Real-name Registration Notice is to require termination of the operation of the online game if it is
	found to be in violation of the Anti-Fatigue Notice, the Monitor System Circular or the Real-name Registration Notice. We developed our own anti-fatigue and real-name registration systems for our games, and implemented them beginning in 2007. Under
	our system, game players must use real identification in order to create accounts, and in this way, we are able to tell which of our game players are minors and thus subject to these regulations. For game players who do not register, we assume that
	they are minors. In order to comply with the anti-fatigue rules, game players under 18 years of age only receive half of the experience time they actually earn after three hours of play. And, after five hours of play, minors receive no experience
	points. We use this system to disincentivize minors from playing in excess of five hours at a time.

	The PRC Constitution states that PRC law protects the freedom and privacy of the communications of citizens and prohibits infringement of such rights. In
	recent years, PRC government authorities have issued various regulations on the use of the Internet that are designed to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure. For example, the ICP Measures prohibit an Internet information
	services provider from insulting or slandering a third party or infringing upon the lawful rights and interests of a third party. In addition, PRC regulations authorize PRC telecommunication authorities to demand rectification of unauthorized
	disclosure by ICPs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Chinese law does not prohibit ICPs from collecting and analyzing personal information from their users. The PRC government, however,
	has the power and authority to order ICPs to submit personal information of an Internet user if such user posts any prohibited content or engages in illegal activities on the Internet. In addition, the Several Provisions stipulate that ICPs must
	not, without the users&#146; consent, collect information on users that can be used, alone or in combination with other information, to identify the user, or User Personal Information, and may not provide any User Personal Information to third
	parties without prior user consent. ICPs may only collect User Personal Information necessary to provide their services and must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and processing of such User Personal
	Information. In addition, an ICP may use User Personal Information only for the stated purposes under the ICP&#146;s scope of services. ICPs are also required to ensure the proper security of User Personal Information, and take immediate remedial
	measures if User Personal Information is suspected to have been disclosed. If the consequences of any such disclosure are expected to be serious, the ICP must immediately report the incident to the telecommunications regulatory authorities and
	cooperate with the authorities in their investigations. We require our users to accept a user agreement whereby they agree to provide certain personal information to us. If we violate these regulations, the MIIT or its local bureaus may impose
	penalties and we may be liable for damage caused to our users.

	and scope of any such collection or use, and must obtain consent from the users whose information is being collected or used. ICP operators are also required to establish and publish their protocols relating to personal information collection or
	use, keep any collected information strictly confidential, and take technological and other measures to maintain the security of such information. ICP operators are required to cease any collection or use of the user personal information, and
	de-register the relevant user account, when a given user stops using the relevant Internet service. ICP operators are further prohibited from divulging, distorting or destroying any such personal information, or selling or providing such information
	unlawfully to other parties. In addition, if an ICP operator appoints an agent to undertake any marketing or technical services that involve the collection or use of personal information, the ICP operator is still required to supervise and manage
	the protection of the information. The Order states, in broad terms, that violators may face warnings, fines, and disclosure to the public and, in the most severe cases, criminal liability.

	the Internet. In April&nbsp;1, 2009, the Ministry of Education, the MIIT and certain other PRC ministries and agencies issued a notice requiring that, by the end of May 2009, all computer terminals connected with the Internet at all elementary and
	secondary schools be able to include and operate Green Dam-Youth Escort, which is software aimed at filtering out unhealthy and vulgar content in text and graphics from the Internet and which, according to the Website for the software, may be used
	to control time spent on the Internet, prohibit access to computer games, and filter out unhealthy Websites. The MIIT further expanded the scope of required use of this filter software by issuing a notice on May&nbsp;19, 2009 requiring that,
	effective as of July&nbsp;1, 2009, all computers manufactured and sold in China have the latest available version of Green Dam-Youth Escort preinstalled when they leave the factory and that all imported computers have the latest available version of
	Green Dam-Youth Escort preinstalled before being sold in China. Green-Dam Youth Escort is to be preinstalled on the hard drive of the computer or in the form of a CD accompanying the computer and is also to be included in the backup partition and
	system restore CD. However, on June&nbsp;30, 2009, the MIIT postponed the implementation of this requirement regarding pre-installation of Green Dam-Youth Escort.

	The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the
<I>
	Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations (&#147;FX Regulations&#148;)
</I>
	,
	which were last amended in August 2008. Under the FX Regulations, the RMB is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not
	for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. Dividends paid
	by a PRC subsidiary to its overseas shareholder are deemed income of the shareholder and are taxable in the PRC. Pursuant to
<I>
	the Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996)
</I>
	, foreign-invested enterprises
	in the PRC may purchase or remit foreign currency, subject to a cap approved by the SAFE, for settlement of current account transactions without the approval of the SAFE. Foreign currency transactions under the capital account are still subject to
	limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, the SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities.

	In July 2014, the SAFE
	promulgated
<I>
	the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration Over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents Via Special Purpose Vehicles
</I>
	(&#147;Circular 37&#148;) which replaced
<I>
	Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents&#146; Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles
</I>
	(&#147;Circular 75&#148;). Circular 37 requires PRC residents, including
	PRC institutions and individuals, to register with the local SAFE branch in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular 37 as a &#147;special purpose vehicle,&#148; for the purpose of
	holding domestic or offshore assets or interests. PRC residents must also file amendments to their registrations in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed
	by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations, PRC residents&#146; failure to comply with specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign
	exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on the
	ability to contribute additional capital to the PRC entity. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange regulations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under Circular 37, if a non-listed special purpose vehicle uses its own equity to grant equity incentives to any directors, supervisors, senior management or
	any other employees directly employed by a domestic enterprise which is directly or indirectly controlled by such special purpose vehicle, or with which such an employee has established an employment relationship, related PRC residents and
	individuals may, prior to exercising their rights, apply to the SAFE for foreign exchange registration formalities for such special purpose vehicle. However, in practice, different local SAFE branches may have different views and procedures on the
	interpretation and implementation of the SAFE regulations, and since Circular 37 was the first regulation to regulate the foreign exchange registration of a non-listed special purpose vehicle&#146;s equity incentives granted to PRC residents, there
	remains uncertainty with respect to its implementation.

	2008, the maximum tax rate for the withholding tax imposed on dividend payments from PRC foreign invested companies to their overseas investors that are not regarded as &#147;resident&#148; for tax purposes is 20%. The rate was reduced to 10% under
	the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Corporate Income Tax Law issued by the State Council. However, a lower withholding tax rate of 5% might be applied if there is a tax treaty between China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding companies,
	such as is the case with Hong Kong, and certain requirements specified by PRC tax authorities are satisfied.

	Our annual and quarterly operating results have varied
	significantly in the past, and may vary significantly in the future, due to a number of factors which could have an adverse impact on our business. Our online advertising revenue often fluctuates as our advertisers adjust their online marketing
	spending as their industries go through business and economic cycles. We rely on third-party providers for high-quality news, video, audio and text content in order to make our Internet platforms, which include our Websites and our applications
	optimized for mobile devices, or Mobile Apps, more attractive to users and advertisers. In recent years, video content costs escalated sharply and adversely affected our operating results. Sogou incurred substantial traffic acquisition costs for
	leveraging traffic from Sogou Website Alliance members&#146; Websites to expand distribution of our advertisers&#146; promotional links or advertisements. If traffic acquisition costs increase sharply, Sogou&#146;s operating results may be adversely
	affected. A significant portion of our online game revenue is attributable to Changyou&#146;s PC game TLBB; however, the popularity of PC games continues to decline as game players increasingly switch to mobile devices to access online games.
	Despite Changyou&#146;s efforts to improve TLBB, our game players have nevertheless lost interest in it over time and TLBB&#146;s popularity, revenues and profitability have continued to decline. If Changyou fails to improve and update TLBB on a
	timely basis, or if Changyou&#146;s competitors introduce more popular games, including mobile games, catering to Changyou&#146;s game-player base, the decline in TLBB&#146;s popularity can be expected to accelerate, which could cause a significant
	decrease in our revenues. Changyou made significantly increased expenditures for sales and marketing during 2013 and 2014, mainly for the promotion of its platform channel business. However, Changyou determined that its efforts were not successful,
	and it is unlikely that Changyou will be able to recoup those expenses.

	over the Internet, including content sites, Web directories, search engines, online games, Internet service providers and sites maintained by government and educational institutions. These sites compete with us for user traffic, advertising dollars,
	online game players, potential partners and mobile services. The Internet market in China is relatively new and rapidly evolving. Competition is intense and expected to increase significantly in the future, because there are no substantial barriers
	to entry in our market.

	Our existing competitors may in the future achieve
	greater market acceptance and gain a greater market share through launching of new products, introducing new technologies, or forming alliances among themselves, or may enhance their ability to compete with us through mergers and acquisitions or
	financing activities. For example, during the past few years, many of our competitors have successfully raised significant amounts of capital through IPOs, follow-on public equity offerings, and convertible bond offerings. Several of our competitors
	have also conducted private placements of equity or debt that included alliances with larger partners who are able to bring them strategic advantages in addition to financing. By enhancing their capital bases and forming strategic alliances, our
	competitors have strengthened their competitiveness and gained greater brand recognition. Recently some of our major competitors have engaged in or initiated transactions that could make it more difficult for us to compete against them effectively.
	For example, Alibaba&#146;s pending acquisition of Youku Tudou could provide Youku Tudou with considerably greater financial and other resources than were previously available to it for developing and expanding its online video business, which
	resources we would be unlikely to be able to match. In addition, Qihoo, with which we compete in our search and search-related business, has entered into a proposed &#147;going private&#148; transaction that would result in the delisting of its
	shares from the New York Stock Exchange; Baidu recently announced a proposal to sell its majority interest in its online video subsidiary iQiyi to members of Baidu&#146;s and iQiyi&#146;s management; and there are indications that SouFun may spin
	off a portion of its business. These transactions could enhance Qihoo&#146;s, iQiyi&#146;s and SouFun&#146;s competitive positions relative to ours by giving them greater flexibility in their business operations and an opportunity to seek high
	valuations on alternative share exchanges, such as PRC exchanges, which could in turn provide them with increased capital resources, the ability to offer more valuable equity incentives for purposes of personnel recruiting, and valuable equity to
	use as consideration for strategic acquisitions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	It is also possible that new competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share. In addition,
	operators of leading Websites or Internet service providers, including Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Google and Microsoft, currently offer, and could expand, their online products and services targeting China. Such entities may cooperate with other
	organizations in China to accelerate their entry into, and to enhance their competitiveness in, the key Chinese markets in which we operate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result,
	we are likely to need additional financial and additional strategic resources in order to compete effectively in the primary markets in which we operate. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing products or in attracting and
	retaining users and advertisers, our revenues and growth rates could decline.

	In addition, we may experience difficulties in promoting our new products, features and services as a result of

	frequent launch and promotion of new functions in our existing products have been impeded by certain of our existing competitors&#146; actions. Such actions have included using products, with the stated premise of protecting users&#146; Internet
	security, to present technical obstacles to Sogou Input Method and Sogou Browser, such as preventing the installation or interrupting the running of Sogou Input Method and Sogou Browser or inducing users to uninstall Sogou Browser. As a result,

	substantially increase our expenditures for creating and maintaining brand loyalty. Our success in promoting and enhancing our brands, as well as our ability to remain competitive, will also depend on our success in offering high quality content,

	The Internet industry is undergoing rapid technological changes. Our future success will depend on our ability to respond to rapidly evolving
	technologies, adapt our services to changing industry standards and improve the performance and reliability of our services. If we fail to adapt to such changes, our business may be adversely affected. For example, with the emergence of cloud
	computing technology, the primary Internet technology platform has been transformed from a traditional platform to a cloud computing platform. If we fail to adapt to the transformation, our products and services upgrade process will fall behind our
	competitors, and accordingly weaken our capacity to adapt our technology to the market. Furthermore, cloud computing itself is a significant business opportunity. If we fail to seize the opportunity, we will lose our ability to capture a share of
	that market. In addition, as mobile devices other than personal computers are increasingly used to access the Internet, we must develop products and services for such devices. To meet advertisers&#146; needs in targeting potential advertisers
	accurately, we need to develop and operate a more effective system for our advertising delivery, tracking and recording. Otherwise, we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and market share. In the meantime, the MIIT and other PRC
	governmental authorities can be expected to regularly promulgate standards and other regulations regarding Internet software and other Internet-based technologies. Adapting to any such standards and regulations could require us to make significant
	expenditures in the future.

	As a component of our growth strategy, we have acquired and intend to actively identify and acquire assets, technologies and

	for acquired intangible assets related to RaidCall, as a result of Changyou&#146;s management&#146;s assessment that the impairments existed based on its conclusion that RaidCall was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyou&#146;s online

	Our performance is largely dependent on talented and highly skilled individuals. Our

	employees&#146; interest with the interests of our shareholders and encourage quality employees to join us and retain our quality employees by providing competitive compensation packages. On January&nbsp;1, 2006, we adopted revised guidance on
	accounting for share-based compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based compensation based on estimated fair values. As a result, our operating results contain a charge for share-based
	compensation expense related to employee share options and restricted stock units. The recognition of share-based compensation in our statement of comprehensive income would have a negative effect on our reported results and earnings per share,
	which could in turn negatively affect our stock price. On the other hand, if we alter our employee stock incentive plan to minimize the share-based compensation expenses, it may limit our ability to continue to use share-based awards as a tool to
	attract and retain our employees, and it may adversely affect our operations. We cannot assure that there will be no changes in the accounting rules for share-based compensation in future; thus our operating results, our stock price and our

	Our future success is heavily dependent upon the services of

	unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily and our business may be severely disrupted. In addition, if any of our key executives or employees joins a competitor or forms a competing company,

	We regard our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success. Unauthorized

	protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, business partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual
	property without authorization. For example, some of our self-developed Web series video productions were disseminated by third parties without our authorization. Furthermore, under the newly amended

	exploitation of the patents has been determined to violate the antitrust laws. Furthermore, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. In particular,
	the laws of the PRC and certain other countries are uncertain or do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Moreover, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual
	property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Future litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. For example, in 2015, we filed intellectual
	property-related lawsuits within Mainland China, including 17 patent infringement lawsuits relating to the Sogou Input Method. We cannot be certain that judgments from the lawsuits will be issued in our favor, or that any resulting damages will

	property of others in the ordinary course of our business and have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to pay damages or to agree to restrict our activities. In particular, if we are found to have violated the intellectual property
	rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, may be ordered to pay damages or fines, and may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternatives. We may incur substantial expense in defending against third party
	infringement claims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability or may materially disrupt the conduct of our business by restricting or prohibiting our use of the intellectual
	property in question. In March 2008, we were sued by four major record companies, Sony BMG, Warner, Universal and Gold Label, which alleged that we had provided music search links and download services that violated copyrights they owned. Although
	the lawsuits were settled in 2013 without any payment of damages by us, we may be subject to similar lawsuits in the future. In addition, it is possible that content on our Sohu News App, which not only includes content developed by us but also
	provides a platform for a significant amount of content generated by others, may violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. Furthermore, PRC governmental authorities have recently been drawing attention to issues regarding the
	infringement of online intellectual property rights. For example, the Jian Wang 2015 campaign, which targets five primary types of Internet infringement and piracy, was launched on June&nbsp;10, 2015.

	and key employees, as well as temporary closure of our offices and related business operations, such as server operations, upon which we rely. Such loss of management and key employees or closures would severely disrupt our business operations and
	adversely affect our results of operations. We have not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future outbreak of H1N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, avian influenza, SARS or any other epidemic. In addition, other
	major natural disasters may also adversely affect our business by, for example, causing disruptions of the Internet network or otherwise affecting access to our portals and our games. For example, after the Sichuan earthquake in May 2008, we

	Further, on January&nbsp;19, 2015, MOFCOM,
	released on its Website for public comment a proposed PRC law, the Draft FIE Law, that appears to include VIEs within the scope of entities that could be considered to be foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, that would be subject to restrictions
	under existing PRC law on foreign investment in certain categories of industry. Specifically, the Draft FIE Law introduces the concept of &#147;actual control&#148; for determining whether an entity is considered to be an FIE. In addition to control
	through direct or indirect ownership or equity, the Draft FIE Law includes control through contractual arrangements within the definition of &#147;actual control.&#148; If the Draft FIE Law is passed by the People&#146;s Congress of the PRC and goes
	into effect in its current form, these provisions regarding control through contractual arrangements could be construed to reach our VIE arrangements, and as a result our VIEs could become explicitly subject to the current restrictions on foreign
	investment in certain categories of industry. The Draft FIE Law includes provisions that would exempt from the definition of foreign invested enterprises entities where the ultimate controlling shareholders are either entities organized under PRC
	law or individuals who are PRC citizens. The Draft FIE Law is silent as to what type of enforcement action might be taken against existing VIEs, such as ours, that operate in restricted or prohibited industries and are not controlled by entities
	organized under PRC law or individuals who are PRC citizens. If the restrictions and prohibitions on foreign invested enterprises included in the Draft FIE Law are enacted and enforced in their current form, our ability to use our VIE arrangements
	and our ability to conduct business through them could be severely limited.

	Because we conduct our Internet operations mainly in the PRC, and are restricted or prohibited by the PRC government from owning Internet content,
	telecommunication, online games operations and certain other operations in the PRC, we are dependent on our VIEs in which we have no direct ownership interest, to provide those services through contractual agreements among the parties and to hold
	some of our assets, including some of the domain names and trademarks relating to our business. These arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over our Internet content, telecommunications operations, online games operations and
	certain other as direct ownership of these businesses. For example, if we had direct ownership of our VIEs, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in their boards of directors, which in turn could effect changes
	at the management level. Due to our VIE structure, we have to rely on contractual rights to effect control and management of our VIEs, which exposes us to the risk of potential breach of contract by the VIEs or their shareholders, such as their
	failing to use the domain names and trademarks held by them, or failing to&nbsp;maintain our Internet platforms, in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. In addition, as each of our VIEs is jointly owned
	by its shareholders, it may be difficult for us to change our corporate structure if such shareholders refuse to cooperate with us. In addition, some of our subsidiaries and VIEs could fail to take actions required for our business, such as entering
	into content development contracts with potential content suppliers or failing to maintain the necessary permits for the content servers. Furthermore, if the shareholders of any of our VIEs were involved in proceedings that had an adverse impact on
	their shareholder interests in such VIE or on our ability to enforce relevant contracts related to the VIE structure, our business would be adversely affected.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The shareholders of the VIEs may breach, or cause the VIEs to breach, the VIE contracts for a number of reasons. For example, their interests as shareholders
	of the VIEs and the interests of our subsidiaries may conflict and we may fail to resolve such conflicts; the shareholders may believe that breaching the contracts will lead to greater economic benefit for them; or the shareholders may otherwise act
	in bad faith. If any of the foregoing were to happen, we might have to rely on legal or arbitral proceedings to enforce our contractual rights. In addition, disputes may arise among the shareholders of any of our VIEs with respect to their ownership
	of such VIE, which could lead them to breach their agreements with us. Such arbitral and legal proceedings and disputes may cost us substantial financial and other resources, and result in disruption of our business, and the outcome might not be in
	our favor. For example, a PRC court or arbitration panel could conclude that our VIE contracts violate PRC law or are otherwise unenforceable. If the contractual arrangements with any of our VIEs were found by PRC authorities with appropriate
	jurisdiction to be unenforceable, we could lose control over the assets owned by such VIE and lose our ability to consolidate such VIE&#146;s results of operations, assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and/or to transfer
	the revenues of such VIE to our corresponding PRC subsidiary.

	As all of these contractual arrangements

	We would have to rely for enforcement on legal remedies under PRC law, including specific performance, injunctive relief or damages, which might not be effective. For example, if we sought to enforce the equity interest purchase right agreements for
	the transfer of equity interests in any of our VIEs, if the transferee was a foreign company the transfer would be subject to approval by PRC governmental authorities such as the MIIT and the MOFCOM, and the transferee would be required to comply
	with various requirements, including qualification and maximum foreign shareholding percentage requirements. As these PRC governmental authorities have wide discretion in granting such approvals, we could fail to obtain such approval. In addition,

	Since 1949, China has been primarily a planned economy subject to a system of macroeconomic management. Although

	The PRC legal system is
	a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations
	governing economic matters in general. Our PRC operating subsidiaries Sohu New Momentum, Sohu Era, Sohu Media, Video Tianjin, Sogou Technology, Sogou Network, AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology are WFOEs, which are enterprises
	incorporated in China and wholly-owned by our indirect off-shore subsidiaries. Those WFOEs are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. In addition, all of our subsidiaries and VIEs are incorporated in China and
	subject to all applicable Chinese laws and regulations. Because of the relatively short period for enacting such a comprehensive legal system, it is possible that the laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent, and their
	interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and other foreign investors, including you. Such uncertainties may also make it easier for others to infringe our
	intellectual property without significant cost, and new entrants to the market may tend to use gray areas to compete with us. In addition, uncertainties in the PRC legal system may lead to penalties imposed on us because of a difference in
	interpretation of the applicable law between the relevant governmental authority and us. For example, under current tax laws and regulations, we are responsible for paying business tax on a &#147;Self-examination and Self-application&#148; basis.
	However, since there is no clear guidance as to the applicability of certain areas of preferential tax treatment, we may be found to be in violation of the tax laws and regulations based on the interpretation of local tax authorities with regard to
	the scope of taxable services and the applicable tax rates, and therefore might be subject to penalties, including monetary penalties. In addition, we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the PRC legal system, particularly with regard
	to the Internet, including the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws.

	written contract, dismissal of employees, severance, and collective bargaining to enhance previous PRC labor laws. Under the Labor Contract Law, an employer is obligated to sign an unlimited-term labor contract with any employee who has worked for

	labor-related regulations since the effectiveness of the Labor Contract Law. For example, there are regulations which require that annual leave ranging from five to 15 days be made available to employees and that employees be compensated for any

<I>
	Catalogue of Classification of Internet Audio-Video Program Services (Trial)
</I>
	on April&nbsp;1, 2010, pursuant to which the
	business of providing public program searching and watching services through the Internet to the public is classified as an Internet audio-video program service for which a Permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs is required. On
	May&nbsp;31, 2008, Sohu Internet received a Permit for the Network Transmission of Audiovisual Programs, issued by the SAPPRFT, and received a renewal on June 20, 2014. However, Sogou Information has not yet been granted such a license. If
	Sogou&#146;s provision of video search services is later challenged by the SAPPRFT, we may be subject to severe penalties, including fines, or the suspension of our video search services or even our operations. In addition, Sohu&#146;s online video
	businesses are operated under various Internet platforms, such as sohu.com, Focus.cn and sogou.com, but current PRC laws and regulations are lack of clear provisions indicating whether it is permissible to provide video services over several
	Internet platforms that are owned by a single company under one permit and the SAPPRFT might claim that such operation under one permit is not allowed under the SAPPRFT Measures. If the SAPPRFT were to make such a claim, we could face penalties from
	the SAPPRFT, such as fines, cancellation of our existing permit, or the forced discontinuation or restriction on our video services or even our operations. If we are ordered to suspend our services, our user traffic will be reduced and therefore our

	PRC laws and regulations, such as the M&amp;A Rules, which were jointly issued by six PRC regulatory
	agencies on August&nbsp;8, 2006 and were amended on June&nbsp;22, 2009, the Anti-Monopoly Law, Circular 6 and the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition
	activities in China by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC
	domestic enterprise, or that the approval from the MOFCOM be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies. PRC laws and regulations also require
	certain merger and acquisition transactions to be subject to a merger control security review. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules, effective from September&nbsp;1, 2011, further provide that, when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a
	domestic enterprise by foreign investors is subject to a security review by the MOFCOM, the principle of substance over form should be applied and foreign investors are prohibited from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring
	transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements of offshore transaction. Factors that the MOFCOM considers in its review are whether (i)&nbsp;an important industry is involved,
	(ii)&nbsp;such transaction involves factors that have had or may have an impact on national economic security and (iii)&nbsp;such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise that holds a well-known PRC trademark or a
	time-honored PRC brand. If a business of any target company that we plan to acquire falls into the ambit of security review, we may not be able to successfully acquire such company. Complying with the requirements of the relevant regulation to
	complete any such transaction could be time-consuming, and any required approval process, including approval from the MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business.

	Under the Arrangement Between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the
	Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital (&#147;China-HK Tax Arrangement&#148;), which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2007, the dividend withholding tax rate may be reduced to 5%,
	if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is considered a non-PRC resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong
	Kong resident enterprise is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividends may remain subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%. On October&nbsp;27, 2009, the SAT issued a Notice on
	How to Understand and Determine the Beneficial Owners in Tax Agreement (&#147;Circular 601&#148;), which provides guidance on determining whether an enterprise is a &#147;beneficial owner&#148; under China&#146;s tax treaties and tax arrangements.
	Circular 601 provides that, in order to be a beneficial owner, an entity generally must be engaged in substantive business activities. A company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits
	will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and will not qualify for treaty benefits such as preferential dividend withholding tax rates. If any of our Hong Kong subsidiaries is, in the light of Circular 601, considered to be a non-beneficial owner
	for purpose of the China-HK Tax Arrangement, any dividends paid to it by any of our PRC Subsidiaries would not qualify for the preferential dividend withholding tax rate of 5%, but rather would be subject to the usual rate of 10%. Furthermore, to
	the extent that the VIEs have undistributed after-tax profits, we must pay tax on behalf of our employees who hold interests in the VIEs when the VIEs distribute dividends in the future. The current individual income tax rate is 20%.

	On September&nbsp;2, 2014, the SAPPRFT issued a
<I>
	Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Online Foreign Audiovisual Content
</I>
	(the
	&#147;September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice&#148;), which requires that operators of audiovisual Websites obtain from the SAPPRFT a Film Public Screening Permit, TV Drama Distribution Permit, or TV Animation Distribution Permit for all foreign films and TV
	dramas before they are transmitted via the Internet in China. The September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice further stipulates that before any foreign films or TV dramas for transmission exclusively via the Internet are purchased after the promulgation of the
	September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice, operators of audiovisual Websites must declare their annual purchasing plans with the SAPPRFT before the end of the year preceding the year of the intended broadcast and obtain the SAPPRFT&#146;s approval. The
	September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice also states that the number of foreign films and TV dramas to be purchased by an operator and transmitted via its Website in a single year may not exceed 30% of the total amount of the Chinese films and TV dramas
	purchased and transmitted by the same Website in the previous year.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We rely heavily on foreign films and TV dramas to attract users and advertisers to
	our online video Internet platforms and, accordingly, the promulgation of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice could have an adverse impact on our online video business. If we are not able to obtain the required SAPPRFT approval in time, there will be
	a delay in our ability to broadcast such foreign films and TV dramas on our Internet platforms and in our generation of advertising revenues from such films and TV dramas. We are also subject to the risk that users might access pirated versions of
	such films and TV dramas during any such delay, and become less likely to view them on our Internet platforms when they become available, which would cause our online traffic and advertising revenues to be lower than we expected. If we fail to
	obtain the required approval by the SAPPRFT, we may not be able to recoup the costs we spent in acquiring the broadcasting rights of, and marketing, those films and TV dramas. In addition, it could be necessary for us to recognize impairment charges
	related to foreign films and TV dramas we have purchased. The requirement of a minimum ratio of domestic video content to foreign-sourced content in the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice may require us to purchase more domestic video content in order
	for us to be permitted to maintain a sufficient portfolio of online foreign films and TV dramas. If, on the other hand, we respond to the minimum ratio requirement of the September 2014 SAPPRFT Notice by reducing our purchases of foreign films and
	TV dramas, our attraction to users, traffic or advertisers on our online video Internet platforms could be reduced, resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues.

	In July 2014, SAFE promulgated Circular 37, which replaced Circular 75, promulgated by SAFE
	in October 2005. Circular 37 requires PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with the local SAFE branch in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular
	37 as a &#147;special purpose vehicle,&#148; for the purpose of holding domestic or offshore assets or interests. PRC residents must also file amendments to their registrations in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special
	purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations, PRC residents&#146; failure to comply with specified registration
	procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on capital inflows from the
	offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on the ability to contribute additional capital to the PRC entity. It is unclear how these regulations will be interpreted and implemented as Circular 37 is newly issued and it is possible
	that some or all of our and Changyou&#146;s shareholders who are PRC residents will not comply with all the requirements required by Circular 37 or related rules. Any future failure by any of our, or Changyou&#146;s shareholders who is a PRC

	The CIT Law imposes a unified income tax rate of 25% for both domestic and foreign invested

	bureau questions whether an enterprise continues to qualify as an HNTE, the enterprise can be subject to further tax examination and may not be able to continue to enjoy the preferential tax rate. &#147;Key National Software Enterprises&#148; can
	enjoy a further reduced preferential income tax rate of 10% for two years, but need to re-apply after the end of the two-year period. Several of our PRC Subsidiaries and VIEs qualified as HNTEs and have enjoyed, and will enjoy reduced tax rates in

	PRC Subsidiaries qualified for exemptions or rate reductions in 2013, 2014 and/or 2015.There are uncertainties regarding future interpretation and implementation of the CIT Law and its implementing regulations. It is possible that the HNTE, Software
	Enterprise, and Key National Software Enterprise qualifications of our operating entities currently qualified as such, or their entitlement to an income tax exemption or refund of their VAT, will be challenged by higher level tax authorities and be
	repealed, or that there will be future implementing regulations that are inconsistent with current interpretation of the CIT Law. For example, according to a circular recently issued by the SAT, there will be new regulations promulgated by relevant
	authorities concerning new criteria to certify a Software Enterprise. Therefore, it is possible that the qualification of one or more of our PRC Subsidiaries or VIEs as a Software Enterprise will be challenged in the future or that such companies
	will not be able to take any further actions, such as re-application for Software Enterprise qualification, to enjoy such preferential tax treatments. If those operating entities cannot qualify for such income tax or VAT holidays, our effective
	income tax rate or VAT rate, as the case may be, will be increased significantly and we may have to pay additional income tax to make up the previously unpaid tax, which would reduce our net income.

	Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, substantially all of our revenues are denominated in RMB. In July 2005, China reformed its exchange rate
	regime by establishing a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The RMB is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate will have some flexibility. Hence,
	considering the floating exchange rate regime, if the RMB depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, our revenues as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline in value. Also, we currently have outstanding loans from overseas banks
	that are denominated in U.S. dollars. To repay these loans, we will need to first convert our cash denominated in RMB into U.S. dollars. If the RMB depreciates relative to the U.S.&nbsp;dollar, we will have to use a larger amount of cash in RMB for

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On May&nbsp;19, 2007, the PBOC announced a policy to expand the maximum daily floating range of RMB trading prices against the
	U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 0.3% to 0.5%. While the international reactions to the RMB revaluation and widening of the RMB&#146;s daily trading band have generally been positive, with the increased floating range
	of the RMB&#146;s value against foreign currencies, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term, depending on the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against
	which it is currently valued. On June&nbsp;19, 2010, the PBOC announced that it has decided to proceed further with the reform of the RMB exchange rate regime to enhance the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate and that emphasis would be placed on
	reflecting market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. While so indicating its intention to make the RMB&#146;s exchange rate more flexible, the PBOC ruled out any sharp fluctuations in the currency or a one-off adjustment. On
	April&nbsp;16, 2012, the PBOC enlarged the floating band of RMB&#146;s trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 0.5% to 1% around the middle rate released by the China Foreign Exchange Trade System
	each day. In February 2014, the center point of the currency&#146;s official trading band hit 6.1146, representing appreciation of more than 11.7% since June&nbsp;19, 2010. On March&nbsp;17, 2014, the PBOC announced a policy to further expand the
	maximum daily floating range of RMB trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market to 2%. In 2015, the RMB depreciated significantly. The center point of the currency&#146;s official trading band was 6.1265 in
	January, and was 6.4465 in December, which contributed to a decline in our 2015 revenues, which we report in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. In addition, there are very limited hedging transactions available in China to reduce our exposure
	to exchange rate fluctuations. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, if at all. In addition,
	our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into U.S. dollars.

	Auditors of companies whose shares are

	registered public accounting firm is located in, and organized under the laws of, the PRC, which is a jurisdiction where the PCAOB, notwithstanding the requirements of U.S. law, is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the
	Chinese authorities. In May 2013, PCAOB announced that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Enforcement Cooperation with the CSRC and the PRC Ministry of Finance, which establishes a cooperative framework between the parties for the
	production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations undertaken by PCAOB, the CSRC or the PRC Ministry of Finance in the United States and the PRC, respectively. PCAOB continues to be in discussions with the CSRC and the PRC

	This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of our independent registered public

	effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm&#146;s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections, which could cause investors and potential

	If additional remedial measures are imposed on the Big Four PRC-based accounting firms, including our
	independent registered public accounting firm, in administrative proceedings brought by the SEC alleging the firms&#146; failure to meet specific criteria set by the SEC, we could be unable to timely file future financial statements in compliance

	In December 2012, the SEC instituted administrative proceedings against the Big Four
	PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, alleging that these firms had violated U.S. securities laws and the SEC&#146;s rules and regulations thereunder by failing to provide to the SEC the firms&#146;
	audit work papers with respect to certain PRC-based companies that are publicly traded in the United States. On January&nbsp;22, 2014, the ALJ presiding over the matter rendered an initial decision that each of the firms had violated the SEC&#146;s
	rules of practice by failing to produce audit workpapers to the SEC. The initial decision censured each of the firms and barred them from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The Big Four PRC-based accounting firms appealed the
	ALJ&#146;s initial decision to the SEC. The ALJ&#146;s decision does not take effect unless and until it is endorsed by the SEC. On February&nbsp;6, 2015, the four China-based accounting firms each agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to
	settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC and audit U.S.-listed companies. The settlement required the firms to follow detailed procedures and to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms&#146;
	audit documents via the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC. If future document productions fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the
	nature of the failure.&nbsp;While we cannot predict if the SEC will further review the four China-based accounting firms&#146; compliance with specified criteria or if the results of such a review would result in the SEC imposing penalties such as
	suspensions or restarting the administrative proceedings, if the accounting firms are subject to additional remedial measures, our ability to file our financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements could be impacted. A determination that
	we have not timely filed financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements could ultimately lead to the delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ or the termination of the registration of our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of
	1934, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our common stock in the United States.

	Given that Sogou is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of us, it is possible that our and Sogou&#146;s interests could diverge in the future as we may

	transactions subject to U.S. tax. If Sogou were to pay a dividend to its shareholders, we, as one of the shareholders of Sogou, could be subject to U.S. corporate income tax at up to 35% on the portion of the dividend it received.

	Changyou&#146;s status as a publicly-listed company may have adverse U.S. tax consequences for us. As the Sohu Group has two listed companies, Sohu.com Inc.
	and Changyou.com Limited, which are regarded as separate legal entities for U.S. tax purposes, certain transactions between these two companies, as well as between their subsidiaries and VIEs, might expose Sohu.com Inc. to U.S. corporate income tax

	Changyou pays dividends, Sohu.com Inc., as one of the shareholders of Changyou, might be subject to U.S. corporate income tax at a rate of up to 35% for the dividends received. Under certain circumstances, when we sell Changyou ordinary shares

	Changyou&#146;s business and the industry in which it operates are evolving rapidly. Changyou was incorporated on August&nbsp;6, 2007 in the Cayman Islands and
	began its online game business as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of us. In 2007 we transferred all of our PC game business to Changyou. In 2011 Changyou acquired 7Road and began generating Web game revenues. In 2012, Changyou began to develop
	and operate mobile games, but did not begin to generate any significant revenues from mobile games until late in 2014 when Changyou launched TLBB 3D. In August 2015, as revenues from Changyou&#146;s Web games Wartune and DDTank had begun to decline,
	Changyou sold 7Road&#146;s operating entity Shenzhen 7Road, and as a result Changyou has no remaining significant Web games in operation. In 2011, Changyou began to expand into the platform channel business with its acquisition of the 17173.com
	Website, which operates Changyou&#146;s online advertising business, from us and acquired the entities operating Changyou&#146;s cinema advertising business. In December 2013, Changyou acquired RaidCall, which operates free social communication
	software; and in July 2014 Changyou acquired a majority interest in MoboTap, which operates the Dolphin Browser. However, Changyou&#146;s acquisitions of RaidCall and MoboTap were not successful, as expected synergies did not materialize.
	Changyou&#146;s revenues from platform channel services other than from online advertising on the 17173.com Website have been relatively insignificant.

	Changyou&#146;s past successes in its online games business with PC games may not provide a meaningful basis for you to evaluate its current business and
	prospects, as game players increasingly migrate from personal computers to mobile devices to access online games and the relative popularity of PC games continues to decline. In response to such rapid migration, Changyou has devoted and Changyou
	expects to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of its mobile games as a critical component of its business strategy. However, Changyou&#146;s mobile games strategy has not been proven, and presents very different challenges
	from those presented in the past by its operation of PC games and Web games. We cannot be certain that Changyou will be successful in its efforts to continue to expand into mobile games. Despite the success of Changyou&#146;s mobile game TLBB 3D,
	the popularity of, and the revenues generated from, the game declined through 2015, and Changyou has not been able to generate comparable revenues from new mobile games to sustain or grow its mobile game business.

	Changyou&#146;s revenues grew significantly in a relatively short period of time prior to 2014, but its revenue growth stalled in 2014 and 2015. Primarily due

	and to $761.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015. Its net income attributable to Changyou.com Limited decreased from $282.4 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 to $268.6 million for the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, Changyou suffered a net loss attributable to Changyou.com Limited of $3.4 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and sustained operating losses for each quarter of 2014. Although Changyou&#146;s net income
	attributable to Changyou.com Limited was $212.8 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, primarily due to the commercial success of its mobile game TLBB 3D, a decrease in its sales and marketing expenses, and a decrease in its salary and
	benefit expenses as a result of a reduction in its workforce, Changyou is not likely to experience rates of revenue growth in the future similar to those that it experienced prior to 2014. Changyou also may experience declines in its revenues or net
	losses in the future due to a number of factors, including, among other things, the continued decline in TLBB&#146;s and TLBB 3D&#146;s revenues and profitability, the uncertain level of popularity of its future games (particularly its future mobile
	games as users increasingly switch to mobile devices), uncertainty as to its ability to develop and launch mobile high-quality games that are commercially successful and the relatively higher game development and distribution costs generally

	Changyou has made acquisitions of, and may potentially acquire in the future, technologies, businesses or
	assets that are complementary to its business and/or enter into strategic alliances in order to leverage its position in the Chinese online game market and expand its business domestically and internationally. Such acquisitions or strategic
	alliances may expose Changyou to potential risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technologies, businesses and personnel including its continued reliance on the management teams of the acquisition targets to operate the
	acquired businesses, unforeseen or hidden liabilities, the diversion of management attention and resources from its existing business, and the inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions or strategic
	alliances. Any difficulties encountered in the acquisition and strategic alliance process may have an adverse effect on Changyou&#146;s ability to manage its business. In addition, acquired businesses may not perform to Changyou&#146;s expectations
	for various reasons, including the loss of key personnel or key clients, and Changyou&#146;s strategic focus may change. As a result, Changyou may not realize the benefits it anticipated. If Changyou fails to integrate acquired technologies,
	businesses and assets or realize the expected benefits, Changyou may not receive a return on its investment and its transaction costs for such acquisitions. The benefits of an acquisition or investment may also take considerable time to develop, and
	we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition or investment will produce the intended benefits, which could adversely affect its business and operating results. Acquisitions could result in contingent liabilities or amortization expenses
	related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill and/or intangible assets, which could adversely affect Changyou&#146;s results of operations. For example, in December 2013, Changyou acquired RaidCall with the expectation of generating
	benefits from synergies with Changyou&#146;s online game business; in November 2013 Changyou acquired Beijing Doyo Internet Technology Co., Ltd., or Doyo, with the expectation of generating benefits from synergies with Changyou&#146;s online
	advertising business, and in July 2014 Changyou acquired MoboTap, which operates the Dolphin Browser, with the expectation of generating benefits from synergies with Changyou&#146;s platform channel business. In 2014 Changyou recognized a $33.8
	million impairment loss for goodwill and a $15.3 million impairment loss for acquired intangible assets related to RaidCall, in 2015 Changyou recognized a $29.6 million impairment loss for goodwill and an $8.9 million impairment loss for acquired
	intangible assets relating to the Dolphin Browser, and in 2015 Changyou sold Doyo and recognized a $1.9 million impairment loss for goodwill, as a result of Changyou&#146;s management&#146;s conclusion that the expected synergies would not

	could in turn make these games less attractive to other game players, resulting in decreased revenues from its existing games. Game players who switch from playing Changyou&#146;s existing games to its new games may also spend less money to purchase
	virtual items in its new games than they would have spent if they had continued playing its existing games, resulting in an adverse effect on its overall revenues. In addition game players&#146; switching from playing Changyou&#146;s existing PC

	Further, even if
	Changyou develops or acquires license rights to a mobile game that is successful, the game&#146;s lifespan may be short, as even successful mobile games tend to have less sustained user loyalty than do successful PC games and Web games. For example,
	the revenues generated from Changyou&#146;s mobile game, TLBB 3D, which was launched in October 2014, declined sequentially through 2015 after its debut, which is typical for a mobile game. In view of the uncertain lifespans of mobile games, it is
	necessary for Changyou to invest considerable sums in order to have a number of mobile games, and particularly mobile games that have the potential to become high-quality, hit games, in its pipeline.

	Changyou may not be able to arrange for its mobile games to be distributed through
	its desired popular third-party mobile application stores with commercial terms, including revenue-sharing arrangements that are favorable enough to it and allow it to achieve an acceptable level of profit from the games. Changyou&#146;s profits
	from mobile games, even if the games are successful, are likely to be relatively lower than the profits it generates from PC games, because, in order to gain access for its games on mobile application stores, Changyou must enter into revenue-sharing
	arrangements that generally result in lower profit margins than those generated from its PC games. Changyou relies on mobile application stores to collect payments from game players for their purchases of its virtual items and to pay to Changyou
	pre-agreed revenue-sharing amounts. If mobile application stores cease to offer Changyou&#146;s games over their platforms, change their user payment policies, such as return policies, or fail to make revenue-sharing payments that are due to
	Changyou, Changyou&#146;s revenues will be adversely affected. In addition, the iOS-based mobile application store allows game players to use foreign currency to purchase virtual items or game points in Changyou&#146;s games, and the store pays to
	Changyou pre-agreed revenue-sharing amounts after converting the foreign-currency denominated revenues from such purchases into RMB using an exchange rate effective at the time of the payment. Since there is usually a delay between the time of a
	game player&#146;s purchase and the time when the store pays Changyou, if the foreign currency used has depreciated against the RMB during the delay Changyou will receive lower share-sharing amounts at the time of the payment than Changyou would
	have received if the payment had been made at the time of the game player&#146;s purchase.

	Changyou frequently obtains license rights to the titles, characters, themes and story lines of popular works in order to adapt online games from such works.
	It can be difficult to identify a sufficient number of popular works that are suitable for adaptation for use in online games, and Changyou faces significant competition for the rights to such works from other online game companies that also adapt
	their online games from popular Chinese works. For example, under Changyou&#146;s existing license agreements with Louis Cha, a famous author of Chinese martial arts novels, Changyou has the exclusive right to adapt certain of his novels into online
	games, such as its TLBB and mobile game TLBB 3D, and to operate the games in the China market. Changyou also has a non-exclusive license to operate, and to sublicense the right to operate, such games outside of China. After the expiration of the
	terms of its existing license agreements with Mr.&nbsp;Cha or other holders of copyrights, Changyou may not be able to renew the agreements with commercial terms that are favorable to it, if at all. In addition, obtaining license rights to suitable
	works can involve significant expenses, and if games that Changyou adapts from particular works are not popular and commercial successes, Changyou will be unable to recoup such expenses. Obtaining such rights and adapting such works for mobile games
	present additional risks, because of the possibly relatively short lifespans of mobile games.

	Changyou&#146;s game operation revenues are generated through the direct online sale of game points and sale of its prepaid game
	cards, and its recognition of those revenues depends on such factors as whether the virtual items purchased by game players are considered consumable or perpetual. Changyou relies on its data systems to record and monitor the purchase and
	consumption of virtual items by its game players and the types of virtual items purchased. If its data systems fail to accurately record the purchase and consumption information of the virtual items, Changyou may not be able to accurately recognize
	its revenues. In addition, various factors affect the estimated lives of perpetual virtual items, such as the average period that game players typically play Changyou&#146;s games and other game player behavior patterns, the acceptance and
	popularity of expansion packs, promotional events launched and market conditions, and Changyou relies on its billing systems to capture such historical game player behavior patterns and other information. If such information is not accurately
	recorded, or if Changyou does not have sufficient information due to the short operating history of any of its games, Changyou will not be able to accurately estimate the lives of, or the estimated average period the game players play its games with
	respect to, the perpetual virtual items, which will also affect its ability to accurately recognize its revenues from such perpetual virtual items. If Changyou&#146;s data systems were damaged by system failure, network interruption, or virus
	infection, or attacked by a hacker, the integrity of data would be compromised, which could adversely affect its revenue recognition and the completeness and accuracy of its recognized revenues.

	In addition, Changyou relies on its data systems to record game player purchase and consumption patterns, based on which Changyou improves its existing

	Currently, Changyou

	credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information and billing addresses, over public networks is essential if Changyou is to maintain its consumers&#146; confidence in it. In addition, Changyou expects that an increasing amount of its
	sales will be conducted over the Internet as a result of the growing use of online payment systems. As a result, the risk of associated online crime will increase. Changyou&#146;s current security measures and those of the third-party online payment
	platforms with whom Changyou transacts business may not be adequate. Changyou must be prepared to increase its security measures and efforts so that its game players have confidence in the reliability of the online payment systems that it uses,
	which will require Changyou to incur additional expense. Such increased security measures may still not make its online payment systems completely safe. In addition, Changyou does not have control over the security measures of its third-party online
	payment vendors. Breaches in the security of online payment systems that Changyou uses could expose it to litigation and liability for failing to secure confidential customer information, and could harm its reputation, ability to attract customers

	All of Changyou&#146;s games, including PC games, mobile games and Web games, are operated under the item-based revenue model. Under
	this revenue model, Changyou&#146;s game players are able to play the games for free if they so choose, but are charged for the purchase of virtual items in the games. Changyou currently expects that all of its game revenues, including revenues from
	any future games, will continue to be generated under the item-based revenue model. The item-based revenue model requires Changyou to design games that not only attract game players to spend more time playing, but also encourage them to purchase
	virtual items. The sale of virtual items requires Changyou to track closely consumer tastes and preferences, especially as to in-game consumption patterns. If Changyou fails to design and price virtual items so as to incentivize game players to
	purchase them, Changyou may not be able to effectively translate its game player base and their playing time into revenues. In addition, the item-based revenue model may cause additional concerns with PRC regulators who have been implementing
	regulations designed to reduce the amount of time that Chinese youths spend on online games and intended to limit the total amount of virtual currency issued by online game operators and the amount purchased by individual game players. A revenue
	model that does not charge for time played may be viewed by the PRC regulators as inconsistent with these goals. The item-based revenue model may not continue to be commercially successful and in the future Changyou may need to change its revenue
	model to a time-based or other revenue model. Any change in revenue model could result in disruption of Changyou&#146;s game operations, a decrease in the number of its game players and a decline in its revenues.

	All online games have limited lifespans. Changyou must launch new games that can generate additional revenue and diversify its revenue

	for new game launches or that its new games will be successful. A number of factors, including technical difficulties, lack of sufficient game development personnel and other resources, failure to obtain or delays in obtaining relevant governmental
	authorities&#146; approvals and adverse developments in Changyou&#146;s relationships with the licensors or third-party operators of its new games could result in delayed launching of its new games. In addition, we cannot assure you that

	fail to differentiate its new games from its existing games. If the new games Changyou introduces are not commercially successful, Changyou may not be able to generate sufficient revenues from new games to sustain or grow its revenues or to recover

	The development of Web software that blocks Internet advertisements before they appear on a user&#146;s screen may hinder the growth of online
	advertising. The expansion of advertisement blocking on the Internet may decrease Changyou&#146;s revenues from the 17173.com Website because, when an advertisement is blocked, it is not downloaded from the server, which means that it will not be
	tracked as a delivered advertisement. In addition, advertisers may choose not to advertise on the Internet or on the 17173.com Website because of the use by third parties of Internet advertisement blocking software.

	Changyou relies on advertising agencies to sell online advertising services on the 17173.com Website. If current trends of consolidation of advertising

	Most of the online advertising services of the 17173.com Website are distributed by, and most of the online advertising revenues of the
	17173.com Website are derived from, advertising agencies. For example, in 2015 Changyou engaged four advertising agencies, which contributed approximately 95% of the online advertising revenues of the 17173.com Website. In consideration for these
	agencies&#146; services, Changyou is required to pay certain percentages of revenues as sales rebates. If the online advertising market is consolidated and effectively controlled by a small number of large advertising agencies, such advertising
	agencies may be in a position to demand higher sales rebates based on increased bargaining power, which could negatively affect Changyou&#146;s online advertising growth, as Changyou books its online advertising revenue net of its sales rebates to
	advertising agencies.

	Changyou&#146;s cinema advertising business generates revenues through contracts that Changyou enters into with advertisers to place their advertisements in
	pre-film advertising slots in movie theaters. Changyou acquires the cinema advertising rights for such pre-film advertising slots under long-term contracts, typically with three&#150;year terms, with various theaters. If Changyou is unable to sell
	to advertisers all of the pre-film advertising slots that Changyou purchases, it may not be able to recoup its upfront payments and committed payments under the contracts. Further, we cannot assure you that Changyou will be able to develop, maintain
	or expand the types of cooperative relationships with movie theaters that will permit Changyou to maintain its existing rights or to obtain any additional rights to pre-movie advertisement slots at reasonable prices. Any failure by Changyou to
	develop, maintain or expand such cooperative relationships could prevent it from increasing its cinema advertising revenues, could cause such revenues to decrease or could result in Changyou&#146;s cinema advertising business generating losses.

	2014 and decreased 41.9% between the end of 2014 and the end of 2015, as Changyou emphasized the development of mobile games and laid off a number of employees who had been focused primarily on international markets and the platform channel business
	other than the 17173.com Website. These layoffs could have an adverse effect on Changyou&#146;s remaining employees&#146; morale and their loyalty to Changyou, and cause it to lose employees whose talents and experience are important for its

	Changyou&#146;s success depends largely on its ability to use and

	if entities licensing to it intellectual property, including, for example, game source codes, do not have adequate rights in any such licensed materials. The validity and scope of claims relating to the intellectual property of game development and
	technology involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analyses and, therefore, tend to be uncertain. If third parties assert copyright or patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights against Changyou, it
	will have to defend itself in litigation or administrative proceedings, which can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of its technical and management personnel. An adverse determination or
	settlement in any such litigation or proceedings to which Changyou may become a party could subject it to significant liability to third parties, or require it to seek licenses from third parties, pay ongoing royalties, or redesign its games or
	subject it to injunctions prohibiting the development and operation of its games.

	Changyou
	regards its intellectual property and proprietary rights as critical to its success. In particular, Changyou has spent a significant amount of time and resources in developing its current games and possible future games. Changyou&#146;s ability to
	protect its proprietary rights in connection with its games is critical for their success and Changyou&#146;s overall financial performance. While Changyou has registered software in China for copyright protection and have taken various measures to
	protect its source codes, such measures may not be sufficient to protect its proprietary information and intellectual property. Intellectual property rights and confidentiality protection in China may not be as effective as they are in the United
	States and other developed countries. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive. In addition, while Changyou has registered some trademarks relating to its games in the PRC and other jurisdictions, and has
	applied for additional registrations of trademarks, in some instances Changyou may not succeed in obtaining registration of trademarks that Changyou has applied for in different languages, such as English. There is no assurance that these pending or
	future trademark applications will be approved. Any failure to register trademarks in any country or region may limit Changyou&#146;s ability to protect its rights in such country or region under relevant trademark laws, and Changyou may need to
	change the name of the relevant trademark in certain cases, which may adversely affect its branding and marketing efforts.

	Despite Changyou&#146;s
	efforts to protect its intellectual property, online game developers may copy its ideas and designs, and other third parties may infringe its intellectual property rights. For example, certain third parties have misappropriated the source codes of
	previous versions of TLBB and have set up unauthorized servers in China and elsewhere to operate TLBB to compete with Changyou. Although in response Changyou has taken measures to enforce its intellectual property rights, such measures may not be
	successful in eliminating these unauthorized servers. The existence of unauthorized servers may attract game players away from Changyou&#146;s games and may result in decreases in its revenues. Litigation relating to intellectual property rights may
	result in substantial costs to Changyou and diversion of resources and management attention away from its business, and may not be successful. In addition, Changyou&#146;s ideas and certain of its designs, if not fixed in a tangible form of
	expression or registered with the appropriate PRC authorities, may not be protected by patents or other intellectual property rights. As a result, Changyou may be limited in its ability to assert intellectual property rights against online game

	those game players reach the &#147;fatiguing&#148; level, and to zero when they reach the &#147;unhealthy&#148; level. In addition, online game players in China are now required to register their identity card numbers before they can play an online
	game. This system allows game operators to identify which game players are minors. These restrictions could limit Changyou&#146;s ability to increase its business among minors. If these restrictions were expanded to apply to adult game players in

	These eight PRC government authorities subsequently promulgated additional regulations, including a Notice on
	Initializing the verification of Real-name Registration for Anti-Fatigue System on Internet Games, or the Real-name Registration Notice, to strengthen the implementation of the anti-fatigue system and real-name registration. The Real-name
	Registration Notice&#146;s main focus is to prevent minors from using an adult&#146;s identity to play Internet games and, accordingly, provides stringent punishment for online game operators for not implementing the anti-fatigue and real name
	registration measures properly and effectively. The most severe punishment contemplated by the Real-name Registration Notice is termination of the operation of the online game if it is found to be in violation of the Anti-Fatigue Notice, the
	Real-name Registration Notice or the circular entitled Implementation of Online Game Monitor System of the Guardians of Minors, or the Monitor System Circular. The Real-name Registration Notice increases Changyou&#146;s operating risks, as it will

	Changyou&#146;s online game revenues are collected through the online sale of game points and sale of its prepaid cards. The Notice on the Reinforcement of the
	Administration of Internet Caf&eacute;s and Online Games, or the Internet Caf&eacute;s Notice, issued by the MOC in 2007, directs the People&#146;s Bank of China, or the PBOC, to strengthen the administration of virtual currency in online games to
	avoid any adverse impact on the PRC economy and financial system. The Internet Caf&eacute;s Notice places strict limits on the total amount of virtual currency issued by online game operators in the PRC and the amount purchased by individual users
	in the PRC, and requires a clear division between virtual transactions and real transactions carried out by way of electronic commerce. The Internet Caf&eacute;s Notice also provides that virtual currency should only be used to purchase virtual
	items. In 2009, the MOC and the MOFCOM jointly issued the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Online Game Virtual Currency, or the Virtual Currency Notice. In the Virtual Currency Notice, the MOC and the MOFCOM for the first time defined
	&#147;virtual currency&#148; as a type of virtual exchange instrument issued by online game operators, purchased directly or indirectly by the game user by exchanging legal currency at a certain exchange rate, saved outside the game programs, stored
	in servers provided by online game operators in electronic record format and represented by specific numeric units. In addition, the Virtual Currency Notice categorizes companies involved with virtual currency in the PRC as either issuers or trading
	platforms and prohibits companies from simultaneously operating both as issuers and as trading platforms. One of the Virtual Currency Notice&#146;s stated intended objectives is to limit the circulation of virtual currency and thereby reduce
	concerns that it may impact real world inflation. Specifically, the Virtual Currency Notice requires online game operators to report the total amount of their issued virtual currency on a quarterly basis, and game operators are prohibited from
	issuing disproportionate amounts of virtual currency in order to generate revenues. In addition, the Virtual Currency Notice reiterates that virtual currency can only be provided to users in exchange for an RMB payment and can only be used to pay
	for virtual goods and services of the issuers. Online game operators are prohibited from providing lucky draws or lotteries which are conducted on the condition that participants contribute cash or virtual currencies in exchange for game props or
	virtual currencies, and from providing virtual currency trading services to minors. The Virtual Currency Notice places additional potentially burdensome obligations on online game operators, including a requirement that operators keep transaction
	data records for no less than 180 days, which means that Changyou must design and operate its databases so that it can maintain users&#146; information for the minimum required period, resulting in higher costs for its online game operations.
	Changyou must tailor its business model carefully in order to comply with the overall requirements of the Virtual Currency Notice, in a manner which can be expected to result in relatively lower sales of Changyou&#146;s game coins and an adverse
	impact on its online game revenues.

	maintain a system to communicate with the parents of minors playing online games and are required to monitor the activities of minors and suspend the accounts of minors if so requested by their parents. We believe that stricter government
	regulations, such as regulations imposing stricter age and hour limits, limiting the issuance of virtual currency by online game operators or the amount of virtual currency that can be purchased by an individual game player, and extending
	anti-fatigue-related regulations to adults, could be implemented in the future. Any such adverse public opinion or tightened government regulations could adversely affect Changyou&#146;s ability to maintain or increase its revenues.

	As the online game industry is at an early stage of development in China, new law and regulations may be adopted

	Internet publishing business apply for a new online publication license and obtain approval from the SAPPRFT prior to the publication of new online games. In addition, under the New Internet Publication Measures Sino-foreign joint ventures and
	foreign-invested entities are not permitted to engage in Internet publication services, and the legal representative of an entity providing Internet publication services may not be a foreigner. As the New Internet Publication Measures are new and

	Internet publishing license to provide online game services. Under the SAPPRFT Online Game Notice, additional approvals from the SAPPRFT are required when game operators release new versions or expansion packs, or make any changes to the originally

	August&nbsp;1, 2010, aiming to further strengthen the MOC&#146;s supervision of the online game industry. Specifically, the Online Game Measures reiterate that the MOC has the power to review the content of all online games except online game
	publications that have been pre-approved by the SAPPRFT. However, the Online Game Measures do not clearly specify what constitutes &#147;online game publication.&#148; Furthermore, the Online Game Measures provide that all domestic online games must
	be filed with the MOC, while all imported online games are subject to a content review prior to their launch. If a substantial change (for example, any significant modification to a game&#146;s storyline, language, tasks, or trading system) is made
	to an existing imported or domestic online game, it will be subject to a new content review.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Changyou&#146;s online game business may be adversely
	affected by the Online Game Measures. The Online Game Measures do not set forth any specific procedure for the required filing and content review procedures for online games and therefore may cause delay when Changyou tries to file or apply for
	content review with the MOC. In addition, for Changyou&#146;s imported licensed games, the requirement for prior approval of any substantial change may cause delay in releasing expansion packs, which may result in higher costs of its online game
	operation and have an adverse effect on its game revenue. In addition, the Online Game Measures do not resolve certain inconsistencies and ambiguities resulting from pronouncements included in previous notices issued by the SAPPRFT and the MOC.
	Because there is ambiguity in the scope of the authority and the roles and responsibilities of governmental departments, such as the SAPPRFT and the MOC, with oversight of the online game industry, Changyou may face stricter scrutiny of the
	day-to-day operations of its online game business. If any of its online game operating entities cannot comply with any of the stipulations of any PRC governmental department regarding the online game industry, Changyou may be subject to various
	penalties and its online game business may be adversely affected.

	Pursuant to the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax
	for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 698, effective on January&nbsp;1, 2008, and the Announcement on Several Issues Related to Enterprise Income Tax for Indirect Asset Transfer by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises , or SAT
	Announcement&nbsp;7, effective on February&nbsp;3, 2015, issued by the SAT, if a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of or similar rights or interests in overseas companies which directly or indirectly own PRC taxable assets
	through an arrangement without a reasonable commercial purpose, but rather to avoid PRC corporate income tax, the transaction will be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets subject to PRC corporate income tax. SAT
	Announcement 7 specifies certain factors that should be considered in determining whether an indirect transfer has a reasonable commercial purpose. However, as SAT Announcement 7 is newly issued, there is uncertainty as to the application of SAT
	Announcement 7 and the interpretation of the term &#147;reasonable commercial purpose.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under SAT Announcement 7, the entity which has the
	obligation to pay the consideration for the transfer to the transferring shareholders has the obligation to withhold any PRC corporate income tax that is due. If the transferring shareholders do not pay corporate income tax that is due for a
	transfer and the entity which has the obligation to pay the consideration does not withhold the tax due, the PRC tax authorities may impose a penalty on the entity that so fails to withhold, which may be relieved or exempted from the withholding
	obligation and any resulting penalty under certain circumstances if it reports such transfer to the PRC tax authorities.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although SAT Announcement 7 is
	generally effective as of February&nbsp;3, 2015, it also applies to cases where the PRC tax treatment of a transaction that took place prior to its effectiveness has not yet been finally settled. As a result, SAT Announcement 7 could be determined
	by PRC tax authorities to be applicable to the historical reorganization of 7Road and Changyou&#146;s acquisitions of the equity interests of 7Road and MoboTap, and it is possible that these transactions could be determined by PRC tax authorities to
	lack a reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, the transfer of 7Road&#146;s or MoboTap&#146;s shares to other parties could be subject to corporate income tax of up to 10% on capital gains generated from such transfers, and PRC tax authorities
	could impose tax obligations on the transferring shareholders or subject us to penalty if the transferring shareholders do not pay such obligations and Changyou does not withhold such tax.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	SAT Announcement 7 and its interpretation by relevant PRC authorities clarify that an exemption provided by SAT Circular 698 for transfers of shares in a
	publicly-traded entity that is listed overseas is available if the purchase of the shares and the sale of the shares both take place in open-market transactions. However, if a shareholder of an entity that is listed overseas purchases shares in the
	open market and sells them in a private transaction, or vice-versa, PRC tax authorities might deem such a transfer to be subject to SAT Circular 698 and SAT Announcement 7, which could subject such shareholder to additional reporting obligations or
	tax burdens. Accordingly, if a holder of Changyou&#146;s ADSs or ordinary shares purchases its ADSs or ordinary shares in the open market and sells them in a private transaction, or vice-versa, and fails to comply with SAT Circular 698 or SAT
	Announcement 7, the PRC tax authorities may take actions, including requesting Changyou to provide assistance for their investigation or impose a penalty on it, which could have a negative impact on Changyou&#146;s business operations. In addition,
	since Changyou may pursue acquisitions as one of its growth strategies, and may conduct acquisitions involving complex corporate structures, PRC tax authorities might impose taxes on capital gains or request that Changyou submit additional
	documentation for their review in connection with any potential acquisitions, which may cause it to incur additional acquisition costs or delay its acquisition timetable.

	The CIT Law imposes a unified income tax rate of 25% for both domestic and foreign invested enterprises. High and New Technology Enterprises
	(&#147;HNTEs&#148;) will enjoy a favorable tax rate of 15% for three years, but need to re-apply after the end of the three-year period. &#147;Key National Software Enterprises&#148; can enjoy a further reduced preferential income tax rate of 10%
	for two years, but need to re-apply after the end of the two-year period. Certain of Changyou&#146;s PRC Subsidiaries and VIEs qualified as HNTEs and enjoyed reduced tax rates in 2013, 2014 and/or 2015. In addition, one of its PRC subsidiaries
	qualified as a Key National Software Enterprise (&#147;KNSE&#148;) in 2013 and 2014. However, as a result of a restructuring of the approval process, the State Council recently suspended the acceptance of applications for KNSE status, and it is not

	There are uncertainties regarding future interpretation and implementation of the CIT Law and its implementing
	regulations. It is possible that the HNTE, Software Enterprise, and KNSE qualifications of Changyou&#146;s operating entities currently qualified as such, or their entitlement to an income tax exemption or refund of their VAT, will be challenged by
	higher level tax authorities and be repealed, or that there will be future implementing regulations that are inconsistent with current interpretation of the CIT Law. Therefore, it is possible that the qualifications of one or more of Changyou&#146;s
	PRC Subsidiaries or VIEs will be challenged in the future or that such companies will not be able to take any further actions, such as re-application for qualification, to enjoy such preferential tax treatments. If those operating entities cannot
	qualify for such income tax or VAT reductions, Changyou&#146;s effective income tax rate or VAT rate, as the case may be, will be increased significantly and Changyou may have to pay additional income tax to make up the previously unpaid tax, which

	Changyou may need to rely on dividends and other distributions on equity, or loans and advances made by its PRC subsidiaries AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing
	Baina Technology to fund any cash requirements Changyou may have, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions, if any, to its shareholders or ADS holders, and to service any debt Changyou may incur. The distribution
	of dividends and the making of loans and advances by entities organized in China are subject to limitations. Regulations in the PRC currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting
	standards and regulations in China. AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology are also required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to their general reserves until the cumulative
	amount of such reserves reaches 50% of the entities&#146; registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends, loans or advances. AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology may also allocate a portion of their after-tax
	profits, as determined by their boards of directors, to their staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to Changyou. In addition, if AmazGame, Gamespace or Beijing Baina Technology incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the
	instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to Changyou. Furthermore, under regulations of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, the RMB is not convertible into foreign
	currencies for capital account items, such as loans, repatriation of investments and investments outside of China, unless prior approval of the SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made, which could delay or prevent any transfers
	of funds from Changyou&#146;s PRC subsidiaries to Changyou.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, there are uncertainties under the CIT Law with regard to the PRC withholding tax
	on dividends paid by AmazGame, Gamespace and Beijing Baina Technology to Changyou&#146;s Hong Kong subsidiaries. Should such dividends be subject to PRC withholding tax or be subject to the usual CIT Law withholding tax rate of 10% rather than the
	preferential dividend withholding tax rate of 5% provided under the China-HK Tax Arrangement, the amount of cash available to Changyou for Changyou&#146;s cash needs, including for the payment of dividends to its shareholders or ADS holders, would
	be reduced.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, Changyou controls its principal VIEs Gamease, Guanyou Gamespace and Wuhan Baina Information through contractual arrangements
	rather than equity ownership. To the extent that there is any distributable profit in Gamease, Guanyou Gamespace or Wuhan Baina Information, it may be difficult for these entities to distribute such profit to AmazGame, Gamespace or Beijing Baina
	Technology, which may further limit the amount that these PRC subsidiaries can distribute to Changyou.

	adopted by the Chinese government intended to slow such growth and to temper real estate prices and inflation, and the significant instability recently experienced in the worldwide economy, and the European Community facing disruptions as a result
	of crises in the economies of Greece and Spain, among other countries, and such factors may be difficult to predict for any given period. Other factors also could cause significant fluctuations in Changyou&#146;s operating results, including the
	timing and success of its new game launches, its costs of developing and launching new games and software, and the level of user activity of its games and software in China during particular fiscal quarters. If its operating results for any period

	Commencing in the second quarter of 2015, the chief operating decision maker (the &#147;CODM&#148;) did not
	consider the others segment to be significant enough to be separately reviewed. Therefore, in order to better reflect management&#146;s perspective, we combined the brand advertising segment and the others segment, and now identify them together as
	the Sohu segment. There are now three segments in the Sohu Group, consisting of the Sohu segment, the Sogou segment, and the Changyou segment. We have restated the presentation of our reportable segments for prior periods to conform to the current
	presentation.

	Sohu.com Inc. (NASDAQ:
	SOHU), a Delaware corporation organized in 1996, is a leading Chinese online media, search and game service group providing comprehensive online products and services on PCs and mobile devices in the People&#146;s Republic of China (the

	unless the context requires otherwise, excludes the businesses and the corresponding subsidiaries and VIEs of Sogou Inc. (&#147;Sogou&#148;) and Changyou.com Limited (&#147;Changyou&#148;), Sogou and Changyou. Sogou and Changyou are indirect
	controlled subsidiaries of Sohu.com Inc. Sohu is a leading Chinese language online media content and services provider. Sogou is a leading online search, client software and mobile Internet product provider in China. Changyou is a leading online
	game developer and operator in China as measured by the popularity of its PC game TLBB and its mobile game TLBB 3D, and engages primarily in the development, operation and licensing of online games for PCs and mobile devices. Most of our operations
	are conducted through our indirect wholly-owned and majority-owned China-Based Subsidiaries and VIEs.

	Through the operation of Sohu, Sogou and Changyou, we generate online advertising revenues (including brand
	advertising revenues and search and search-related revenues), online games revenues and others revenues. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, our total revenues were approximately $1.94 billion, representing an increase of 16% compared to
	2014, and our gross margin decreased from 59% to 56%. Our online advertising business generated revenues of $1.12 billion with 24% annual growth, representing 58% of total revenues. Our online game business generated revenues of $636.8 million with
	2% annual decline, representing 33% of total revenues. In 2015, our net profit before deducting the noncontrolling interest was $108.9 million, compared to net loss of $171.2 million in 2014. In 2015, our net loss after deducting the noncontrolling
	interest was $49.6 million, compared to a net loss of $166.7 million in 2014. Diluted net loss per share attributable to Sohu.com Inc. was $1.32 in 2015, compared to a diluted net loss per share attributable to Sohu.com Inc. of $4.43 in 2014.

<B>
	Factors and Trends Affecting our Business
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	With the
	accelerated shift in user activities from desktop computers (&#147;PCs&#148;) to mobile devices and an increase in the number of Internet users, the usage of various kinds of mobile Internet services continued to accelerate at a fast pace during
	2015. As of the end of December 2015, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (or CNNIC), the number of mobile Internet users had reached 620&nbsp;million, an increase of 11% from the end of 2014. At Sohu, we focused our efforts
	on developing a portfolio of leading mobile products across our business lines that we believed our users would like. Our key products continued to gain traction. For example, during the month ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, mobile traffic for our
	online video business contributed more than 60% of our total traffic. During 2015, Sogou&#146;s mobile search traffic increased over 100%. In December of 2015, mobile traffic accounted for 57% of our total traffic. The monetization of mobile traffic
	also progressed well, contributing a relatively higher percentage of our total revenues.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2015, the deceleration of growth in the Chinese macro economy
	impacted our brand advertising business, as traditional brand advertisers tightened their marketing budgets. Meanwhile, beginning in the third quarter of 2015, the depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar had an adverse effect on our reported
	financial results, which are denominated in the U.S. dollar. For Sohu Media Portal, we focused on growing the penetration of two of the leading mobile news products in the market, the Web-based HTML5 Portal m.sohu.com and the Sohu News App. As of
	the end of December 2015, the combined reach of these two products exceeded 50&nbsp;million daily unique visitors. Sohu Video is a leading online video content and service provider in China. In 2015, the online video industry as a whole continued to
	gain viewers from television stations, and advertising dollars shifted in accordance with that trend. In the meantime, as competition intensified, the major players stepped up content spending to attract viewers. The average licensing fee for top
	class TV dramas and variety shows grew significantly in 2015 as compared to 2014. During the year, Sohu Video focused on taking as rational approach as possible, by acquiring only enough expensive &#147;head&#148; content to remain competitive,
	while shifting resources to self-developed and professionally-generated content. The total amount that we spent for content tended to be lower than that of some of our key competitors. Despite this, the overall amount that we spent for content
	continued to rise from 2014, and the operating losses of Sohu Video widened. We expect that the industry-wide unfavorable cost structure will continue to overshadow the profitability outlook for the entire industry, including us, in the near term.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For our search and search-related business, on September&nbsp;16, 2013 we entered into a strategic cooperation with Tencent Holding Limited (Tencent
	Holding Limited together with its subsidiaries, &#147;Tencent&#148;), in connection with which Tencent invested in Sogou. We believe that this strategic cooperation has reinforced Sogou as a leader in the large and fast-growing China market for
	search and Internet services, particularly on the mobile side. Sogou is one of the top three players in the online search sector in China. For 2015, we reinforced our competitive position, as we continually raised the bar in terms of quality for our
	core search service and further differentiated our search service through deepening our cooperation with Tencent&#146;s social platforms and bringing in more unique and high-quality content. For 2015, aggregate paid clicks and cost-per-click
	continued to grow, with improving mobile monetization.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For Changyou, TLBB and TLBB 3D continued to be the two biggest revenue contributors. However, both
	games are experiencing revenue declines as a natural course of their lifecycles. We expect further sequential decrease in revenues from TLBB and TLBB 3D in the first quarter of 2016. Nevertheless, we will explore new social interactive features that
	can be added to the games in order to prolong their life spans. For the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the PC games and mobile games that Changyou operates had approximately 7.3&nbsp;million total average monthly active accounts and
	approximately 2.1&nbsp;million total active paying accounts.

	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
	liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
	results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
	Identified below are the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments, and those that we believe are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements.

	Basis of Consolidation
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our consolidated financial
	statements include the accounts of Sohu.com Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.

	VIE Consolidation

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our VIEs are wholly or
	partially owned by certain of our employees as nominee shareholders. For our consolidated VIEs, management made evaluations of the relationships between us and our VIEs and the economic benefit flow of contractual arrangements with the VIEs. In
	connection with such evaluation, management also took into account the fact that, as a result of such contractual arrangements, we control the shareholders&#146; voting interests in these VIEs. As a result of such evaluation, management concluded
	that we are the primary beneficiary of our consolidated VIEs.

	Noncontrolling Interest Recognition
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Noncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of the equity of majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs which is not attributable, directly or
	indirectly, to the controlling shareholder. Currently, the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of noncontrolling interests for Sogou and Changyou.

	Noncontrolling Interest for Sogou
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As we control the
	election of the Board of Directors of Sogou, we are Sogou&#146;s controlling shareholder. Accordingly, we consolidate Sogou in our consolidated financial statements, and recognize noncontrolling interest reflecting economic interests in Sogou held
	by shareholders other than us. To reflect the economic interest in Sogou held by shareholders other than us (the &#147;Sogou noncontrolling shareholders&#148;), Sogou&#146;s net income /(loss) attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders is
	recorded as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Sogou&#146;s cumulative results of operations attributable to the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders, along with changes in shareholders&#146; equity
	/(deficit) and adjustment for share-based compensation expense in relation to those share-based awards which are unvested and vested but not yet settled and the Sogou noncontrolling shareholders&#146; investments in Sogou Preferred Shares and
	Ordinary Shares are accounted for as a noncontrolling interest classified as permanent equity in our consolidated balance sheets, as we have the right to reject a redemption requested by the noncontrolling interest. These treatments are based on the
	terms governing investment, and on the terms of the classes of Sogou shares held, by the noncontrolling shareholders in Sogou.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year

	the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is considered that it is more likely than not that
	some portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future profitability, and tax planning strategies. If
	events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those

	questions whether an enterprise continues to qualify as an HNTE, the enterprise can be subject to further tax examination and may not be able to continue to enjoy the preferential tax rate. In addition, the CIT Law and its implementing regulations

	The CIT Law imposes a 10% withholding income tax on dividends distributed by foreign invested enterprises to their immediate holding companies outside Mainland
	China. A lower withholding tax rate may be applied if there is a tax treaty between Mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. A holding company in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate under
	an arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the &#147;Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital,&#148; if such holding company is considered a
	non-PRC resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC foreign invested enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong holding company is not
	considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividend will remain subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%.

	our business model is determined by our management. An impairment loss would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the

	In accordance with
<I>
	ASC 350
</I>
	, we do not amortize goodwill, but test it for impairment. Goodwill is not
	deductible for tax purposes. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October&nbsp;1, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be
	impaired. Commencing in September 2011, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) revised guidance on &#147;Testing of Goodwill for Impairment.&#148; Under this guidance, we have the option to choose whether we will
	apply the qualitative assessment first and then the quantitative assessment, if necessary, or to apply the quantitative assessment directly. For reporting units applying a qualitative assessment first, we start the goodwill impairment test by
	assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more-likely-than-not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
	its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value. For reporting units
	directly applying the quantitative assessment, we perform the goodwill impairment test by quantitatively comparing the fair values of those reporting units to their carrying amounts.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and
	liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate
	discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.

	Changyou&#146;s acquisition of

	2015. The fair value of the contingent consideration was recognized on the acquisition date using the income approach/ discounted cash flow method with a scenario analysis applied. There were no indemnification assets involved. In March 2015, as
	Doyo&#146;s performance had exceeded the relevant performance milestone, Changyou re-classified such contingent consideration to other short-term liabilities in the amount of $6.0&nbsp;million in the consolidated balance sheet. In September 2015,
	Changyou entered into an agreement to sell all of the equity interests of Doyo. The aggregate consideration under the agreement included cash consideration of approximately $2.9 million, and forgiveness, upon the completion of the sale, of the $6.0
	million contingent consideration payable. The sale was completed on October&nbsp;27, 2015 and Changyou had received all of the cash consideration as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, and there was no further gain or loss recognized in our consolidated

	An
	entity&#146;s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management&#146;s judgment is
	essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. The functional currency of Sohu.com Inc. is the U.S.
	dollar. The functional currency of our subsidiaries in the U.S., the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of our subsidiaries and VIEs in other countries are the national currencies
	of those counties, rather than the U.S. dollar.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Foreign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated

	effect at that date. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency re-measurement are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

	Financial statements of entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars, which is the reporting currency.
	Assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Shareholders&#146; equity accounts
	are translated using the historical exchange rates at the date the entry to shareholders&#146; equity was recorded, except for the change in retained earnings during the year, which is translated using the historical exchange rates used to translate
	each period&#146;s income statement. Differences resulting from translating a foreign currency to the reporting currency are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of balance sheets.

	$54.8 million, mainly due to a decrease in Web game revenues following the completion of the sale of the 7Road business during the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decrease in Web games revenues for 2014 was $35.0 million, mainly due to
	decreased revenues in China from Wartune and DDTank, which had reached a mature phase in their operation.

	Cost of revenues for other services was $80.6 million for 2015, compared to $71.5 million and $55.9 million, respectively, for 2014 and 2013. The year-on-year
	increase for 2015 was $9.1 million, which was mainly due to $5.7 million in film production costs for &#147;Jian Bing Man&#148; that were recognized concurrently with revenue in the third quarter of 2015. The year-on-year increase for 2014 was $15.5
	million, which was mainly due to revenue-sharing payments related to the IVAS business.

	The CIT Law imposes a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by foreign-invested enterprises in the
	PRC to their immediate holding companies outside Mainland China. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between Mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. A holding company in Hong
	Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate under an arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the &#147;Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on
	Income and Capital&#148; if such holding company is considered a non-PRC resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interests in the PRC foreign invested enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax
	authority. However, if the Hong Kong holding company is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividend will remain subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%. As of December&nbsp;31,
	2015, we had accrued deferred tax liabilities in the amount of $24.9 million for withholding taxes associated with dividends paid by Changyou&#146;s Mainland China-based WFOEs to Changyou&#146;s Hong Kong subsidiary.

	for services provided to the VIEs by the PRC subsidiaries, significant cash balances remained in Changyou&#146;s VIEs as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. As Changyou&#146;s VIEs are not owned by Changyou&#146;s PRC subsidiaries, the VIEs are not able to

	IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On May&nbsp;28, 2014, the FASB and IASB issued their long-awaited converged standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The standard
	is intended to improve the financial reporting of revenue and improve comparability of the top line in financial statements globally. The FASB is amending the FASB
<I>
	Accounting Standards Codification
</I>
	and creating a new Topic 606,
<I>
	Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers
</I>
	, to supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition
</I>
	, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. Additionally, the amendments
	supersede some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition&#151;Construction-Type and Production-Type Contract
</I>
	. For a public business entity, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
	December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance.

	In February 2015, the FASB issued
<I>
	Consolidation (Topic 810) &#151;Amendments to the Consolidation
	Analysis
</I>
	. The amendments in Topic 810 respond to stakeholders&#146; concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities, by changing aspects of the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine
	whether it should consolidate such entities. Under the amendments, all reporting entities are within the scope of Subtopic
<I>
	810-10, Consolidation&#151;Overall
</I>
	, including limited partnerships and similar legal entities, unless a scope exception
	applies. The amendments are intended to be an improvement to current U.S. GAAP, as they simplify the codification of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;167,
<I>
	Amendments to FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;46(R),
</I>
	with changes including reducing the number of
	consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments are effective for public business companies for

</I>
	which eliminates the

	the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015,

	In November 2015, the FASB issued

	presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
	after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the effect of adoption of this ASU, and expect that it will have an impact on our consolidated balance sheets, as our current deferred tax

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While our reporting
	currency is the U.S. dollar, to date the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in RMB and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues
	and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB. If the RMB depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the value of our RMB revenues and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial
	statements will decline. For example, our revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 were $1.94 billion and our total assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 were $3.04 billion, representing revenues of RMB12.58 billion and total assets of
	RMB19.75 billion at the noon buying rate of RMB 6.4936 to $1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2015. If the value of the RMB were to depreciate by approximately 10% to RMB 7.1430 to $1.00, the value of the same amount of RMB-denominated revenue and total
	assets in U.S. dollars would be $1.76 billion and $2.77 billion, respectively. Also, we currently have outstanding loans from overseas banks that are denominated in U.S. dollars. To repay these loans, we will need to first convert our cash
	denominated in RMB into U.S. dollars. If the RMB depreciates relative to the U.S.&nbsp;dollar, we will have to use a larger amount of cash in RMB for any such loan repayment. For example, Changyou&#146;s loans denominated in U.S. dollars as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 aggregated $344.5 million. We needed RMB2.24 billion to settle these loans at the noon buying rate of RMB 6.4936 to $1.00 on December&nbsp;31, 2015. If the value of the RMB were to depreciate by approximately 10% to RMB 7.1430
	to $1.00, we would have to use RMB2.46 billion to settle loans in the same aggregate amount. We do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk.

	The RMB is currently freely convertible under the &#147;current account,&#148; which includes dividends, trade
	and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the &#147;capital account,&#148; which includes foreign direct investment. In addition, commencing on July&nbsp;21, 2005, China reformed its exchange rate regime by changing to a
	managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. Under the managed floating exchange rate regime, the RMB is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate of the RMB against
	the U.S. dollar was adjusted to RMB8.11 per U.S. dollar as of July&nbsp;21, 2005, representing an appreciation of about 2%. The People&#146;s Bank of China will announce the closing prices of foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar traded against
	the RMB in the inter-bank foreign exchange market after the closing of the market on each business day, and will make such prices the central parity for trading against the RMB on the following business day. On May&nbsp;19, 2007, the People&#146;s
	Bank of China announced a policy to expand the maximum daily floating range of RMB trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 0.3% to 0.5%. While the international reactions to the RMB revaluation and
	widening of the RMB&#146;s daily trading band have generally been positive, with the increased floating range of the RMB&#146;s value against foreign currencies, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar or
	other foreign currencies in the long term, depending on the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued. On June&nbsp;19, 2010, the People&#146;s Bank of China announced that it has decided to proceed further with
	the reform of the RMB exchange rate regime to enhance the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate and that emphasis would be placed on reflecting market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. While so indicating its intention to
	make the RMB&#146;s exchange rate more flexible, the People&#146;s Bank of China ruled out any sharp fluctuations in the currency or a one-off adjustment. On April&nbsp;16, 2012, the People&#146;s Bank of China announced a policy to expand the
	maximum daily floating range of RMB trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 0.5% to 1%. On March&nbsp;17, 2014, the People&#146;s Bank of China announced a policy to further expand the maximum daily
	floating range of RMB trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market to 2%. In 2015, the RMB depreciated significantly. The center point of the currency&#146;s official trading band was 6.1265 in January and
	was 6.4465 in December, which contributed to a decline in the Company&#146;s 2015 revenues, which are reported in U.S. dollars. In the long term, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate more significantly in value against the U.S. dollar or other
	foreign currencies, depending on the market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies.

	To date, we have not entered into any hedging

	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
	under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
	reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal
	control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial
	reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
	with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP, an independent registered public accounting
	firm, as stated in their report which is included in this report on pages F-2.

	To Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sohu.com Inc.:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sohu.com Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and December
	31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
	opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion,
	the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
	Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
	of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management&#146;s report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under Item 9A of Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
	statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
	reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
	significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
	the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
	circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a
	process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
	(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
	only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that
	could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
	or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
	procedures may deteriorate.

	(representing approximately 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Sohu Video on a fully-diluted basis) to management and key employees of the video division and to Sohu management. As of December 31, 2015, grants of options for the purchase of

	, as of December 31, 2015, no grant date had occurred, because the broader terms and conditions of the option awards had neither been finalized nor mutually agreed upon with the recipients, and such mutual
	understanding cannot be reached until the fair value of the awards is determinable and can be accounted for. In accordance with
<I>
	ASC 718-10-55
</I>
	, the Group&#146;s management determined that the service inception date with respect to vested
	option awards for the purchase of 4,972,800 shares had preceded the grant date. Therefore, the Group began to recognize compensation expense for Sohu Video share-based awards in the second quarter of 2014 and re-measured, and will re-measure, the
	compensation expense on each subsequent reporting date based on the then-current fair values of the awards until the grant date is established.

	financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. Deferred tax
	assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on available evidence, it is considered that it is more likely than not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such determination, the Group
	considers factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future profitability, and tax planning strategies. If events were to occur in the future that would allow the Group to realize more of its deferred tax assets
	than the presently recorded net amount, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred. If events were to occur in the future that would require the Group to realize less
	of its deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount, an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred. Significant management

	Group&#146;s historical results and anticipated results and is subject to many factors. The discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the Group&#146;s business model is determined by its management. An impairment loss would be
	recorded if the Group determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.

	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of the Sohu
	Group&#146;s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports in its
	financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. If a measurement period adjustment is identified, the Group recognizes the adjustment as part of the acquisition accounting. The Sohu Group increases or
	decreases the provisional amounts of identifiable assets or liabilities by means of increases or decreases in goodwill for measurement period adjustments.

	In accordance with
<I>
	ASC 350
</I>
	, the Group does not amortize goodwill, but tests it for impairment. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The Group
	tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 1, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. Commencing in September 2011,
	the Group adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) revised guidance on &#147;Testing of Goodwill for Impairment.&#148; Under this guidance, the Group has the option to choose whether it will apply the qualitative
	assessment first and then the quantitative assessment, if necessary, or to apply the quantitative assessment directly. For reporting units applying a qualitative assessment first, the Group starts the goodwill impairment test by assessing
	qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Group determines that it is more-likely-than-not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its
	carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying value. For reporting units directly
	applying the quantitative assessment, the Group performs the goodwill impairment test by quantitatively comparing the fair values of those reporting units to their carrying amounts.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and
	liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate
	discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.

	An entity&#146;s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates,
	normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management&#146;s judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price
	and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. The functional currency of Sohu.com Inc. is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Sohu Group&#146;s subsidiaries in the U.S., the Cayman Islands, the British
	Virgin Islands and Hong Kong is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of the Sohu Group&#146;s subsidiaries and VIEs in other countries are the national currencies of those counties, rather than the U.S. dollar.

	translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Shareholders&#146; equity accounts are translated using the historical exchange rates at the date the entry to shareholders&#146; equity was recorded, except for the
	change in retained earnings during the year, which is translated using the historical exchange rates used to translate each period&#146;s income statement. Differences resulting from translating a foreign currency to the reporting currency are
	recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of balance sheets.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On May 28, 2014, the FASB and IASB issued their long-awaited converged standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The standard is
	intended to improve the financial reporting of revenue and improve comparability of the top line in financial statements globally. The FASB is amending the FASB
<I>
	Accounting Standards Codification
</I>
	and creating a new Topic 606,
<I>
	Revenue from
	Contracts with Customers
</I>
	, to supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition
</I>
	, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. Additionally, the amendments supersede
	some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35,
<I>
	Revenue Recognition&#151;Construction-Type and Production-Type Contract
</I>
	. For a public business entity, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
	2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2015, the FASB issued
<I>
	Consolidation (Topic 810) &#151;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
</I>
	. The amendments in Topic 810 respond to
	stakeholders&#146; concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities, by changing aspects of the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate such entities. Under the
	amendments, all reporting entities are within the scope of
<I>
	Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation&#151;Overall
</I>
	, including limited partnerships and similar legal entities, unless a scope exception applies. The amendments are intended to be an
	improvement to current U.S. GAAP, as they simplify the codification of FASB Statement No. 167,
<I>
	Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)
</I>
	, with changes including reducing the number of consolidation models through the elimination of the
	indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments are effective for public business companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for
	interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Group is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance.

	In September 2015, the FASB issued

	ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments
</I>
	, which eliminates the requirement for
	acquirers in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on
	earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption
	permitted. The implementation of this update is not expected to have any material impact on the Group&#146;s condensed consolidated financial statements.

	In November 2015, the FASB issued
<I>
	ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

	presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
	after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Group is currently evaluating the effect of adoption of this ASU and expects that it will have an impact on the Group&#146;s consolidated balance sheets, as current
	deferred tax assets were $4.7 million and current deferred tax liabilities were $24.9 million as of December 31, 2015.

	The Sohu Group&#146;s segments are business units that offer different services and are reviewed separately by the chief operating decision maker (the

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Commencing in the second quarter of 2015, the CODM did not consider the others segment to be significant enough to be separately reviewed. Therefore, in order
	to better reflect management&#146;s perspective, the Group combined the brand advertising segment and the others segment, and now identifies them together as the Sohu segment. There are now three segments in the Group, consisting of the Sohu
	segment, the Sogou segment, and the Changyou segment. The Group has restated the presentation of its reportable segments for prior periods to conform to the current presentation.

	Note (1): During 2015, certain subsidiaries of Changyou and certain subsidiaries of SoEasy entered into a series of loan
	agreements, pursuant to which the subsidiaries of Changyou are entitled to draw down HK dollar-denominated loans from the SoEasy subsidiaries and the SoEasy subsidiaries are entitled to draw down equivalent RMB-denominated loans from the
	subsidiaries of Changyou, to facilitate each other&#146;s business operations. All of the loans carry a fixed rate of interest equal to the current market interest rate. As of December 31, 2015, Changyou had drawn down from SoEasy loans in an
	aggregate principal amount of HKD100 million (approximately $12.9 million), which is recorded in other short-term liabilities, and SoEasy had drawn down from Changyou loans in an aggregate principal amount of RMB80 million (approximately $12.3
	million), which is recorded in prepaid and other current assets . For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest income that Changyou earned from the RMB-denominated loan was $0.4 million and was recorded as prepaid and other current assets, and
	interest expense that Changyou accrued for the HK dollar-denominated loan was $0.1 million and was recorded as other short-term liabilities.

	The

	Group classifies the valuation techniques that use the pervasive interest rates input as Level 2 of fair value measurements. Generally there are no quoted prices in active markets for identical cash equivalents at the reporting date. In order to
	determine the fair value, the Group must use the discounted cash flow method and observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
	inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

	In 2015, the Group recognized $19.9 million in losses for impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the Dolphin Browser operated by MoboTap and
	related license rights. In 2015, the financial performance of the Dolphin Browser was below original expectations, and Changyou&#146;s management concluded that the Dolphin Browser was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyou&#146;s
	platform channel business and accordingly performed a goodwill impairment test for the goodwill generated in the acquisition of MoboTap, and recognized an $8.9 million impairment loss for intangible assets. The impairment loss is recognized in the
	consolidated statements of comprehensive income under &#147;goodwill impairment and impairment of intangibles as part of acquisition of a business.&#148; The impaired intangible assets primarily consist of user base, technology, trademark and
	license rights.

	In 2014, the Group recognized a $20.2 million impairment loss related to Changyou&#146;s intangible assets. The impairment loss for
	intangible assets was mainly from developed technologies and domain names, including a $15.3 million impairment loss related to RaidCall. The impairment loss was recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as &#147;goodwill
	impairment and impairment of intangible assets acquired as part of business acquisitions.&#148;

	In 2015, there were two separate reporting units under the Sohu segment, consisting of brand advertising and
	others. There was only one reporting unit under the Sogou segment. There were five main reporting units under the Changyou segment, consisting of the Changyou online game business, the 17173.com Website, RaidCall, MoboTap and the cinema advertising
	business. The Sohu Group tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on October 1, 2015. The Group performed the impairment test by qualitative or quantitative method. For the Sohu segment and the Sogou segment, impairment tests were
	conducted by quantitatively comparing the fair values of those reporting units to their carrying amounts. Sohu and Sogou estimated the fair values by weighting the results from the income approach. The valuation approach considers a number of
	factors that include expected future cash flows, growth rates, and discount rates, and requires Sohu and Sogou to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of the business. For the Changyou
	segment, given that the financial performance of the Dolphin Browser operated by MoboTap was below original expectations, Changyou&#146;s management concluded that the Dolphin Browser was unable to provide expected synergies with Changyou&#146;s
	platform business, and performed a two-step goodwill impairment test for the goodwill generated in the acquisition of MoboTap, and accordingly recognized a $29.6 million goodwill impairment loss. Changyou also recognized a $1.9 goodwill impairment
	loss with respect to Beijing Doyo Internet Technology Co., Ltd. (&#147;Doyo&#148;) as the total consideration received by Changyou for the sale of Doyo under an agreement entered into in September 2015 was lower than the carrying value of
	Doyo&#146;s net assets. The goodwill impairment losses are included in the Group&#146;s statements of comprehensive income as &#147;goodwill impairment and impairment of intangible assets acquired as part of business acquisitions.&#148; The fair
	values of the other reporting units exceeded their carrying values, indicating that the goodwill of those reporting units was not impaired.

	In 2014,

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The PRC Corporate Income Tax Law (the &#147;CIT Law&#148;) applies an income tax rate of 25% to all enterprises but grants preferential tax treatment to High
	and New Technology Enterprises (&#147;HNTEs&#148;). Under this preferential tax treatment, HNTEs can enjoy an income tax rate of 15% for three years, but need to re-apply after the end of the three-year period. If at any time during the three-year
	period the relevant tax bureau questions whether an enterprise continues to qualify as an HNTE, the enterprise can be subject to further tax examination and may not be able to continue to enjoy the preferential tax rate. In addition, the CIT Law and
	its implementing regulations provide that a &#147;Software Enterprise&#148; can enjoy an income tax exemption for two years beginning with its first profitable year and a 50% reduction to a rate of 12.5% for the subsequent three years. An entity
	that qualifies as a &#147;Key National Software Enterprise&#148; can enjoy a further reduced preferential income tax rate of 10% for two years, but needs to re-apply after the end of the two-year period.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	CIT Law imposes a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC to their immediate holding companies outside Mainland China. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty
	arrangement between Mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. A holding company in Hong Kong, for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate under an arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special
	Administrative Region on the &#147;Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital&#148; if such holding company is considered a non-PRC resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the
	equity interests in the PRC foreign invested enterprise distributing the dividends, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. However, if the Hong Kong holding company is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under
	applicable PRC tax regulations, such dividend will remain subject to a withholding tax rate of 10%.

	As of December 31, 2015, the Group had net operating losses from PRC entities of approximately $484.1 million
	available to offset against future net profit for income tax purposes. The Group anticipates that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses (except for the net operating losses generated by Changyou&#146;s VIEs) may not be utilized
	based on its estimate of the operation performance of these PRC entities; therefore, $137.4 million in deferred tax assets generated from net operating losses were offset by a valuation allowance.

	The Chinese market in which the Sohu Group operates poses certain macro-economic and regulatory risks and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the
	ability to operate an Internet business and to conduct brand advertising, search and search-related, online game, and others services in the PRC. Though the PRC has, since 1978, implemented a wide range of market-oriented economic reforms, continued
	reforms and progress towards a full market-oriented economy are uncertain. In addition, the telecommunication, information, and media industries remain highly regulated. Restrictions are currently in place and are unclear with respect to which
	segments of these industries foreign-owned entities, like the Sohu Group, may operate. The Chinese government may issue from time to time new laws or new interpretations of existing laws to regulate areas such as telecommunication, information and
	media. The Sohu Group&#146;s legal structure and scope of operations in China could be subject to restrictions, which could result in limits on its ability to conduct business in the PRC. Certain risks related to PRC law that could affect the Sohu
	Group&#146;s VIE structure are discussed in Note 15 - VIEs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Regulatory risks also encompass interpretation by PRC tax authorities of current tax law,

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Sohu Group&#146;s sales, purchase and expense transactions are generally
	denominated in RMB and a significant portion of its assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. In China, foreign exchange transactions are required by law to be transacted only by
	authorized financial institutions. Remittances in currencies other than RMB by its subsidiaries in China may require certain supporting documentation in order to effect the remittance.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Changyou&#146;s acquisition
	of Beijing Doyo Internet Technology Co., Ltd. (&#147;Doyo&#148;) included a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid by Changyou based on the financial performance of Doyo for the fiscal years 2013
	through 2015. The fair value of the contingent consideration was recognized on the acquisition date using the income approach/ discounted cash flow method with a scenario analysis applied. There were no indemnification assets involved. In March
	2015, as Doyo&#146;s performance had exceeded the relevant performance milestone, Changyou re-classified such contingent consideration to other short-term liabilities in the amount of $6.0 million in the consolidated balance sheet. In September
	2015, Changyou entered into an agreement to sell all of the equity interests of Doyo. The aggregate consideration under the agreement includes cash consideration of approximately $2.9 million, and forgiveness, upon the completion of the sale, of the
	$6.0 million contingent consideration payable. The transaction was completed on October 27, 2015 and there was no further gain or loss recognized in the Group&#146;s consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	PRC laws and regulations prohibit or
	restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, Internet access, online games, mobile, value added telecommunications and certain other businesses in which the Sohu Group is engaged or could be deemed to be
	engaged. Consequently, the Sohu Group conducts certain of its operations and businesses in the PRC through its VIEs. The Sohu Group consolidates in its consolidated financial statements all of the VIEs of which the Group is the primary beneficiary.

</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	Sohu Group adopted the guidance of accounting for VIEs, which requires VIEs to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity. Management made evaluations of the relationships between the Sohu Group and its VIEs and the economic benefit
	flow of contractual arrangements with the VIEs. In connection with such evaluation, management also took into account the fact that, as a result of contractual arrangements with its consolidated VIEs, the Sohu Group controls the shareholders&#146;
	voting interests in those VIEs. As a result of such evaluation, the management concluded that the Sohu Group is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs which the Group consolidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	All of the consolidated VIEs are incorporated and operated in the PRC, and the Group&#146;s principal VIEs are directly or indirectly owned by Dr. Charles
	Zhang, the Sohu Group&#146;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or other executive officers and employees of the Sohu Group identified below. Capital for the consolidated VIEs was funded by the Sohu Group through loans provided to Dr. Charles
	Zhang and other executive officers and employees, and was initially recorded as loans to related parties. These loans are eliminated for accounting purposes against the capital of the VIEs upon consolidation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under contractual agreements with the Sohu Group, Dr. Charles Zhang and those other executive officers and employees of the Sohu Group who are shareholders of
	the consolidated VIEs are required to transfer their ownership in these entities to the Group, if permitted by PRC laws and regulations, or, if not so permitted, to designees of the Group at any time as requested by the Group to repay the loans
	outstanding. All voting rights of the consolidated VIEs are assigned to the Sohu Group, and the Group has the right to designate all directors and senior management personnel of the consolidated VIEs, and also has the obligation to absorb losses of
	the consolidated VIEs. Dr. Charles Zhang and those other executive officers and employees of the Sohu Group who are shareholders of the consolidated VIEs have pledged their shares in the consolidated VIEs as collateral for the loans. As of December
	31, 2015, the aggregate amount of these loans was $9.3 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under its contractual arrangements with the consolidated VIEs, the Sohu Group has the
	power to direct activities of the VIEs, and can have assets transferred freely out of the VIEs without any restrictions. Therefore, the Group considers that there is no asset of a consolidated VIE that can be used only to settle obligations of the
	VIEs, except for registered capital and PRC statutory reserves of the VIEs. As of December 31, 2015, the registered capital and PRC statutory reserves of the consolidated VIEs totaled $79.6 million. As all of the consolidated VIEs are incorporated
	as limited liability companies under the PRC Company Law, creditors of the consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the Sohu Group for any of the liabilities of the consolidated VIEs. Currently there is no contractual
	arrangement that could require the Sohu Group to provide additional financial support to the consolidated VIEs. As the Sohu Group is conducting certain business in the PRC mainly through the consolidated VIEs, the Group may provide such support on a
	discretionary basis in the future, which could expose the Group to a loss.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Sohu Group classified the consolidated VIEs within the Sohu Group as

	VIE-Related Risks
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	It is possible that the Sohu Group&#146;s operation of certain of its operations and businesses through VIEs could be found by PRC authorities to be in
	violation of PRC law and regulations prohibiting or restricting foreign ownership of companies that engage in such operations and businesses. While the Sohu Group&#146;s management considers the possibility of such a finding by PRC regulatory
	authorities under current law and regulations to be remote, on January 19, 2015, the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC, or (the &#147;MOFCOM&#148;) released on its Website for public comment a proposed PRC law (the &#147;Draft FIE Law&#148;) that
	appears to include VIEs within the scope of entities that could be considered to be foreign invested enterprises (or &#147;FIEs&#148;) that would be subject to restrictions under existing PRC law on foreign investment in certain categories of
	industry. Specifically, the Draft FIE Law introduces the concept of &#147;actual control&#148; for determining whether an entity is considered to be an FIE. In addition to control through direct or indirect ownership or equity, the Draft FIE Law
	includes control through contractual arrangements within the definition of &#147;actual control.&#148; If the Draft FIE Law is passed by the People&#146;s Congress of the PRC and goes into effect in its current form, these provisions regarding
	control through contractual arrangements could be construed to reach the Sohu Group&#146;s VIE arrangements, and as a result the Sohu Group&#146;s VIEs could become explicitly subject to the current restrictions on foreign investment in certain
	categories of industry. The Draft FIE Law includes provisions that would exempt from the definition of foreign invested enterprises entities where the ultimate controlling shareholders are either entities organized under PRC law or individuals who
	are PRC citizens. The Draft FIE Law is silent as to what type of enforcement action might be taken against existing VIEs that operate in restricted or prohibited industries and are not controlled by entities organized under PRC law or individuals
	who are PRC citizens. If a finding were made by PRC authorities, under existing law and regulations or under the Draft FIE Law if it becomes effective, that the Sohu Group&#146;s operation of certain of its operations and businesses through VIEs is
	prohibited, regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the licensing and operation of such operations and businesses would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including levying fines, confiscating the Sohu Group&#146;s income,
	revoking the business or operating licenses of the affected businesses, requiring the Sohu Group to restructure its ownership structure or operations, or requiring the Sohu Group to discontinue all or any portion of its operations. Any of these
	actions could cause significant disruption to the Sohu Group&#146;s business operations, and have a severe adverse impact on the Sohu Group&#146;s cash flows, financial position and operating performance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, it is possible that the contracts among the Sohu Group, the Sohu Group&#146;s VIEs and shareholders of its VIEs would not be enforceable in China
	if PRC government authorities or courts were to find that such contracts contravene PRC law and regulations or are otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons. In the event that the Sohu Group was unable to enforce these contractual
	arrangements, the Sohu Group would not be able to exert effective control over the affected VIEs. Consequently, such VIE&#146;s results of operations, assets and liabilities would not be included in the Sohu Group&#146;s consolidated financial
	statements. If such were the case, the Sohu Group&#146;s cash flows, financial position and operating performance would be severely adversely affected. The Sohu Group&#146;s contractual arrangements with respect to its consolidated VIEs are in
	place. The Sohu Group&#146;s management believes that such contracts are enforceable, and considers the possibility remote that PRC regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the Sohu Group&#146;s operations and contractual relationships would
	find the contracts to be unenforceable.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Sohu Group&#146;s operations and businesses rely on the operations and businesses of its VIEs, which hold
	certain recognized and unrecognized revenue-producing assets. The recognized revenue-producing assets include goodwill and intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions. Goodwill primarily represents the expected synergies from combining
	an acquired business with the Sohu Group. Intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions mainly consist of customer relationships, non-compete agreements, user bases, copyrights, trademarks and developed technologies. Unrecognized
	revenue-producing assets mainly consist of licenses and intellectual property. Licenses include operations licenses, such as Internet information service licenses and licenses for providing content. Intellectual property developed by the Sohu Group
	mainly consists of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and domain names. The Sohu Group&#146;s operations and businesses may be adversely impacted if the Sohu Group loses the ability to use and enjoy assets held by these VIEs.

	On February 7, 2015, the
	Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved contractual grants of options for the purchase of an aggregate of 1,068,000 shares of common stock to the Company&#146;s management and key employees with nominal exercise prices of $0.001. These awards are
	expected to vest and become exercisable in four equal installments over a period of four years, with each installment vesting upon satisfaction of a service period requirement and certain subjective performance targets. Because the grant date had
	not been established as of December 31, 2015, compensation expense was accrued beginning on the service inception date and will be re-measured based on the then-current fair value of the awards on each subsequent reporting date until the grant date

	rights may be granted under the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan to management and employees of Sogou and of any present or future parents or subsidiaries or variable interest entities of Sogou. The maximum term of any share right granted under the
	Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan is ten years from the grant date. The Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan will expire on October 19, 2020. As of December 31, 2015, Sogou had granted options for the purchase of 32,913,825 ordinary shares under the 2010

	performance target for each installment is set at the beginning of each vesting period. Accordingly, for purposes of recognition of share-based compensation expense, each installment is considered to be granted as of that date. As of December 31,
	2015, performance targets had been set for options for the purchase of 23,017,447 shares, subject to vesting upon service period requirements for management and key employees being met and Sogou&#146;s achievement of performance targets and,
	accordingly, such options were considered granted for purposes of recognition of share-based compensation expense. As of December 31, 2015, options for the purchase of 22,659,309 shares had become vested and exercisable because both the service

	(&#147;Sogou&#146;s IPO&#148;) and the expiration of all underwriters&#146; lockup periods applicable to Sogou&#146;s IPO, and (ii) each of the three or four subsequent installments vesting on the first, second, third and, if applicable, fourth
	anniversary dates, respectively, of the closing of Sogou&#146;s IPO. The completion of an IPO is considered to be a performance condition of the awards. An IPO is not considered to be probable until it is completed. Under

	,
	compensation cost should be accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and should not be accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved. As a result, no compensation expense will be
	recognized related to these options until the completion of an IPO, and hence no share-based compensation expense was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 for the options for the purchase of 8,310,000 shares that are subject to vesting

	Sogou estimated the risk-free rate based on the market yields of U.S. Treasury securities with an estimated country-risk
	differential as of the valuation date. An exercise multiple was estimated as the ratio of the fair value of the shares over the exercise price as of the time the option is exercised, based on consideration of research studies regarding exercise
	patterns based on historical statistical data. In Sogou&#146;s valuation analysis, a multiple of two was applied for employees and a multiple of three was applied for management. Sogou estimated the forfeiture rate to be 1% for Sogou
	management&#146;s share options granted as of December 31, 2015 and 12% for Sogou employees&#146; share options granted as of December 31, 2015. The life of the share options is the contract life of the option. Based on the option agreement, the
	contract life of the option is 10 years. The expected volatility at the valuation date was estimated based on the historical volatility of comparable companies for the period before the grant date with length commensurate with the expected term of

	key employees the opportunity to purchase from Sohu up to 12,000,000 ordinary shares of Sogou at a fixed exercise price of $0.625 or $0.001 per share. Of these 12,000,000 ordinary shares, 8,800,000 are Sogou ordinary shares previously held by Sohu
	and 3,200,000 are Sogou ordinary shares that were newly-issued on April 14, 2011 by Sogou to Sohu at a price of $0.625 per share, or a total of $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, Sohu had granted options for the purchase of 10,724,500 Sogou

	each installment is set at the beginning of each vesting period. Accordingly, for purposes of recognition of share-based compensation expense, each installment is considered to be granted as of that date. As of December 31, 2015, performance targets
	had been set for options for the purchase of 8,232,000 shares vesting upon service period requirements for Sohu&#146;s management and key employees being met and Sogou&#146;s achievement of performance targets and, accordingly, such share options

	6,979,700 shares had been exercised.

	The remaining options for the purchase of 2,400,000 shares vest and become exercisable in five equal
	installments, with (i) the first installment vesting upon Sogou&#146;s IPO and the expiration of all underwriters&#146; lockup periods applicable to the IPO, and (ii) each of the four subsequent installments vesting on the first, second, third and
	fourth anniversary dates, respectively, of the closing of Sogou&#146;s IPO. All installments of the options for the purchase of 2,400,000 shares that are subject to vesting upon the completion of Sogou&#146;s IPO were considered granted upon the
	issuance of the options. The completion of a firm commitment IPO is considered to be a performance condition of the awards. An IPO event is not considered to be probable until it is completed. Under
<I>
	ASC 718

	, compensation cost should be
	accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and should not be accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved. As a result, no compensation expense will be recognized related to these
	options until the completion of an IPO, and hence no share-based compensation expense was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 for these options for the purchase of 2,400,000 shares.

	In the first and second quarter of 2013, a portion of the share options granted under the Sogou 2010 Share Incentive Plan and the Sohu Management Sogou Share
	Option Arrangement were exercised early, and the resulting Sogou ordinary shares were transferred to trusts with the original option grantees as beneficiaries. The trusts will distribute the shares to those beneficiaries in installments based on the
	vesting requirements under the original option agreements. Although these trust arrangements caused a modification of the terms of these share options, the modification was not considered substantive. Accordingly, no incremental fair value related
	to these shares resulted from the modification, and the remaining share-based compensation expense for these shares will continue to be recognized over the original remaining vesting period.

	restricted share units will continue to vest under the original Tencent share award arrangements provided the transferred employees continue to be employed by Sogou during the requisite service period. After the transfer of the Soso search-related
	businesses to Sogou, Sogou applied the guidance in

</I>
	to measure the related compensation expense, based on the then-current fair value at each reporting date, which is deemed to have been incurred by Tencent as an investor on
	Sogou&#146;s behalf. To determine the then-current fair value of the Tencent restricted share units granted to these employees, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was applied. Because Sogou is not required to
	reimburse Tencent for such share-based compensation expense, the related amount was recorded by Sogou as a capital contribution from Tencent.

	effective in May 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, share-based compensation expense of $2.0 million, $4.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to these Tencent restricted share units was recognized in the

	ten-for-one share split of its ordinary shares. Most of the awards granted under the Changyou 2008 Share Incentive Plan vest over a period of four years. The maximum term of any share right granted under the Changyou 2008 Share Incentive Plan is ten

	These options provide for vesting in four equal installments over a period of four years, with each installment vesting upon satisfaction of a service period
	requirement and the achievement of certain subjective performance targets. The grant date had not been established as of December 31, 2015, because a mutual understanding had not been reached between Changyou and the recipients clarifying the
	subjective performance requirements. Compensation expense for these options is accrued commencing on the service inception date and is re-measured based on the then-current fair value of the options on each subsequent reporting date until the grant
	date is established. To determine the fair value of these share options, the public market price of the underlying shares at each reporting date was used and a binomial valuation model was applied.

	wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an investment agreement with MoboTap Inc. (&#147;MoboTap&#148;), a Cayman Islands company which is the mobile technology developer behind the Dolphin Browser, MoboTap&#146;s subsidiaries and variable interest
	entities, and MoboTap&#146;s shareholders pursuant to which Changyou purchased from then existing shareholders of MoboTap at the closing, which took place on July 31, 2014, shares of MoboTap representing 51% of the equity interests in MoboTap on a
	fully-diluted basis for approximately $90.8 million in cash. In addition, Changyou has the right to purchase up to 10% of the equity interests in MoboTap from the noncontrolling shareholders, at a price of 20% below the IPO price, before a qualified
	IPO of MoboTap. If MoboTap achieves specified performance milestones for 2016 and certain specified key employees continue their employment with MoboTap at the time the milestones are achieved, but there has not been an IPO by MoboTap, the
	noncontrolling shareholders of MoboTap will have a one-time right to put to Changyou shares of MoboTap held by them, representing up to 15% of the equity interests in MoboTap, for an aggregate price of up to $53 million. The Sohu Group began to
	consolidate MoboTap&#146;s financial statements commencing with the closing of the acquisition.

	The acquired identifiable intangible assets represent the Dolphin Browser user base, technology and trademark, the useful

	Based on an assessment of MoboTap&#146;s financial performance conducted in connection with the acquisition, MoboTap was not considered
	material to the Sohu Group. Thus the Sohu Group&#146;s management concluded that the presentation of pro forma financial information with respect to the results of operations of the Sohu Group including the acquired MoboTap was not necessary. The
	operating results of MoboTap, which are not significant to the Sohu Group, have been included in the Sohu Group&#146;s consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. As the Dolphin Browser serves as a gateway to a host of user
	activities on mobile devices and contributes to Changyou&#146;s platform channel business, MoboTap is reported under the Changyou segment.

	In 2015, given
	that the performance of the Dolphin Browser operated by MoboTap was below original expectations, Changyou&#146;s management concluded that the Dolphin Browser was unable to provide the expected synergies with Changyou&#146;s platform business.
	Accordingly, Changyou recognized a $29.6 million impairment loss for goodwill and a $8.9 million impairment loss for acquired intangible assets generated in the acquisition of the MoboTap business.

	Since Doyo primarily engages in the online advertising and traffic monetization business, which has similar economic

	Prior to the acquisition, Doyo did not prepare its financial statements in accordance with

	acquisition and the Sohu Group&#146;s financial performance for that year, the Sohu Group&#146;s management determined that Doyo was not material to the Sohu Group. Thus the Group&#146;s management believes the presentation of pro forma financial

	contingent consideration payable. Management treated the fact that the total consideration for the sale of Doyo pursuant to the agreement will be lower than the carrying value of Doyo&#146;s net assets as an indicator that the goodwill associated
	with Doyo might be impaired. Therefore, in September 2015, management performed a goodwill impairment test and recognized goodwill impairment in the amount of $1.9 million. The transaction was completed on October 27, 2015 and there was no further
	gain or loss recognized in the Group&#146;s consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

	On November 19, 2013, Changyou entered into an investment agreement with Beijing Kunlun Tech Co., Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the
	&#147;Kalends Group&#148;), pursuant to which TalkTalk was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and initially wholly-owned by the Kalends Group, RaidCall (HK) Limited (&#147;RaidCall HK&#148;) was incorporated in Hong Kong as a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of TalkTalk, and Beijing Changyou RaidCall Internet Technology Co., Ltd. (&#147;Changyou RaidCall&#148;) was incorporated in the PRC as a wholly-owned subsidiary of RaidCall HK. The Kalends Group then transferred to RaidCall HK and
	Changyou RaidCall all of the assets associated with a free social communication software platform, which is specifically designed for online gaming and music-related value-added services, that the Kalends Group operated through a series of Internet
	platforms (the &#147;RaidCall Business&#148;). On December 24, 2013, pursuant to the investment agreement, Changyou acquired 62.5% of the equity interests, on a fully-diluted basis, in TalkTalk for total cash consideration of $47.6 million. Of the
	total consideration, $27.6 million was paid to purchase from the Kalends Group a portion of the ordinary shares of TalkTalk held by the Kalends Group and $20.0 million was injected for newly-issued ordinary shares of TalkTalk. Also effective upon
	the closing of the transaction, 15% of the equity interests of TalkTalk on a fully-diluted basis were reserved for grants of equity incentive awards to key employees associated with RaidCall and the Kalends Group continued to hold the remaining
	22.5% of the equity interests on a fully-diluted basis.

	The acquired identifiable intangible assets were valued by the income approach. The excess of the purchase price over the
	tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets (consisting primarily of software technology and domain name) acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill relating to the Changyou segment. Goodwill of $33.7 million primarily represents
	synergies between Changyou&#146;s existing online game business and the RaidCall Business that had been expected to result from an enhancement of game players&#146; experience through Changyou&#146;s offering of the RaidCall communications tool in
	Changyou&#146;s online games. In accordance with

	Prior to the acquisition, the RaidCall Business did not prepare its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Group determined that the cost of
	reconstructing the financial statements of the RaidCall Business for the periods prior to the acquisition outweighed the benefits. Based on a comparison of the RaidCall Business&#146;s financial performance for the year preceding the acquisition and
	the Sohu Group&#146;s financial performance for that year, the Sohu Group&#146;s management determined that the RaidCall Business was not material to the Sohu Group. Thus the Group&#146;s management believes the presentation of pro forma financial
	information with respect to the results of operations of the Sohu Group for the business combination is not necessary.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2014, Changyou&#146;s

	Basic net income
	/(loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income /(loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common
	shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares comprise shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of share-based awards with performance requirements is
	not considered before the performance targets are actually met. The computation of diluted net income /(loss) per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. an
	increase in earnings per share amounts or a decrease in loss per share amounts) on net income /(loss) per share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 55,870 common shares potentially issuable upon the exercise or settlement of share-based awards

	Additionally, for

	The Sohu Group&#146;s subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs in China participate in a government-mandated multi-employer defined contribution plan pursuant to
	which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor regulations require the Group&#146;s subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs to pay to the local labor bureau a monthly contribution at a stated
	contribution rate based on the monthly compensation of qualified employees. The relevant local labor bureau is responsible for meeting all retirement benefit obligations; the Group&#146;s China-based subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs have no
	further commitments beyond their monthly contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Group&#146;s China based subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs contributed a total of $132.6 million, $134.2 million and $100.7 million,

	In accordance with the China Foreign Investment Enterprises laws, those of the Group&#146;s China-based subsidiaries that are considered under PRC law to be
	WFOEs are required to make appropriations from their after-tax profit as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC (the &#147;after-tax-profit under PRC GAAP&#148;) to non-distributable reserve funds, including (i) a
	general reserve fund, (ii) an enterprise expansion fund, and (iii) a staff bonus and welfare fund. Each year, at least 10% of the after-tax-profit under PRC GAAP is required to be set aside as general reserve fund until such appropriations for the
	fund equal 50% of the registered capital of the applicable entity. The appropriation for the other two reserve funds is at the Group&#146;s discretion as determined by the Board of Directors of each entity.

	Pursuant to the China Company Laws, those of the Group&#146;s China-based subsidiaries that are considered under PRC law to be domestically funded
	enterprises, as well as the Group&#146;s VIEs, are required to make appropriations from their after-tax-profit under PRC GAAP to non-distributable reserve funds, including a statutory surplus fund and a discretionary surplus fund. Each year, at
	least 10% of the after-tax-profit under PRC GAAP is required to be set aside as statutory surplus fund until such appropriations for the fund equal 50% of the registered capital of the applicable entity. The appropriation for the discretionary
	surplus fund is at the Company&#146;s discretion as determined by the Board of Directors of each entity.

	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the total amount of profits contributed to these funds by the Group was $7.7 million, $4.9 million and
	$3.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the total amount of profits contributed to these funds by the Group was $46.8 million and $39.0 million, respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of these and other restrictions under PRC laws and regulations, the Group&#146;s China-based subsidiaries and VIEs are restricted in their ability
	to transfer a portion of their net assets in the form of non-distributable reserve funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans or advances. Even though the Company currently does not require any such dividends, loans or advances from its
	China-based subsidiaries and VIEs for working capital and other funding purposes, the Company may in the future require additional cash resources from its China-based subsidiaries and VIEs due to changes in business conditions, to fund future
	acquisitions and development, or to declare and pay dividends to or make distributions to its shareholders.

	short-term investments are denominated in RMB. The Group may experience economic losses and negative impacts on earnings and equity as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB. Moreover, the Chinese
	government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. The Group may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain
	and remit foreign currency.

	As
	of December 31, 2015, approximately 59% of the Sohu Group&#146;s cash and cash equivalents were held in 16 financial institutions in China. The remaining cash and cash equivalents were held primarily in financial institutions in Hong Kong and the
	U.S.

	As of December 31, 2014, approximately 46% of the Sohu Group&#146;s cash and cash equivalents were held in 15 financial institutions in China. The
	remaining cash and cash equivalents were mainly held in financial institutions in Hong Kong and the U.S.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Sohu Group holds its cash and bank deposits
	at Chinese financial institutions that are among the largest and most respected in the PRC and at international financial institutions with high ratings from internationally-recognized rating agencies. The management chooses these institutions
	because of their reputations and track records for stability, and their known large cash reserves, and management periodically reviews these institutions&#146; reputations, track records, and reported reserves.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Management expects that any additional institutions that the Sohu Group uses for its cash and bank deposits will be chosen with similar criteria for
	soundness. As a further means of managing its credit risk, the Sohu Group holds its cash and bank deposits in a number of different financial institutions. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Sohu Group held its cash and bank deposits in different
	financial institutions and held no more than approximately 28% and 24%, respectively, of its total cash at any single institution.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under PRC law, it is
	generally required that a commercial bank in the PRC that holds third party cash deposits protect the depositors&#146; rights over and interests in their deposited money; PRC banks are subject to a series of risk control regulatory standards; and
	PRC bank regulatory authorities are empowered to take over the operation and management of any PRC bank that faces a material credit crisis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the
	credit risk related to accounts receivable, the Sohu Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and, if necessary, maintains reserves for potential credit losses. Historically, such losses have been within management&#146;s
	expectations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Relevant
	PRC law and regulations permit payment of dividends by PRC-based operating entities only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a PRC-based operating entity is
	required to annually appropriate 10% of net after-tax income to the statutory surplus reserve fund (see Note 23) prior to payment of any dividends, unless such reserve funds have reached 50% of the entity&#146;s registered capital. As a result of
	these and other restrictions under PRC law and regulations, PRC-based operating entities are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company either in the form of dividends, loans or advances. Even though the
	Company currently does not require any such dividends, loans or advances from PRC-based operating entities for working capital and other funding purposes, the Company may in the future require additional cash resources from PRC-based operating
	entities due to changes in business conditions, to fund future acquisitions and development, or to declare and pay dividends to or distribution to its shareholders.
