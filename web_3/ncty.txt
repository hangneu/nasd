	There are numerous online game operators in China. We expect that, given the relatively low
	entry barriers, more companies will enter the online game industry in China and a wider range of online games will be introduced to the Chinese market. Our competitors vary in size and include large companies, many of which have significantly

	Perfect World Co., Ltd. and NetDragon Websoft Inc. As a result, we may not be able to devote the same degree of resources as our competitors do to designing, developing or acquiring new games, undertaking extensive marketing campaigns, adopting
	aggressive pricing policies, paying high compensation to game developers or compensating independent game developers. Our competitors may introduce new business methods from time to time. If these new business methods are more attractive to
	customers than the business methods we currently use, our customers may switch to our competitors&#146; games, and we may lose market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against new or existing competitors, or
	against new business methods implemented by them. In addition, the increasing competition we anticipate in the online game industry may also reduce the number of our users or the growth rate of our user base or reduce the game points spending for
	in-game premiums. All of these competitive factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from recovering market share and profitability.

	facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunication service providers are required to maintain network and information security in
	accordance with the standards set forth under relevant PRC regulations. The local authorities in charge of telecommunications services are required to ensure that existing ICP license holders conduct a self-assessment of their compliance with the

	Reorganization Regulation by State Council and Relevant Interpretation by State Commission Office for Public Sector Reform to Further Strengthen the Administration of Pre-approval on Online Games and Approval on Import Online Games, or the GAPP
	Circular, which provides that foreign investors shall not control or participate in PRC online game operation businesses indirectly or in a disguised manner by establishing joint venture companies or entering into relevant agreements with, or by
	providing technical supports to, such PRC online game operation companies, or by inputting the users&#146; registration, account management or game card consumption directly into the interconnected gaming platform or fighting platform controlled or

	have regulatory jurisdiction over the online game operations in China, such as the Ministry of Culture and MIIT, did not join GAPP in issuing the GAPP Circular. To date, the GAPPRFT has not issued any interpretation of the GAPP Circular. It is not
	yet clear how this GAPP Circular will be implemented.

	For example, the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, promulgated the Rules of Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review
	System of Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors in August 2011, or the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, to implement the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Establishing the Security Review System for
	Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated on February 3, 2011, or Circular No. 6. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules came into effect on September 1, 2011 and replaced the Interim Provisions of the Ministry of
	Commerce on Matters Relating to the Implementation of the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated by MOFCOM in March 2011. According to these circulars and rules, a security review
	is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having &#147;national defense and security&#148; concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire the &#147;de facto control&#148; of domestic enterprises
	having &#147;national security&#148; concerns. In addition, when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a domestic enterprise by foreign investors is subject to the security review, MOFCOM will look into the substance and actual impact
	of the transaction. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules further prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through
	contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. There is no explicit provision or official interpretation stating that our online game operation services falls into the scope subject to the security review, and there is no requirement for foreign
	investors in those merger and acquisition transactions already completed prior to the promulgation of Circular No. 6 to submit such transactions to MOFCOM for security review. As we have already obtained the &#147;de facto control&#148; over our
	affiliated PRC entities prior to the effectiveness of these circulars and rules, we do not believe we are required to submit our existing contractual arrangement to MOFCOM for security review. However, we are advised by our PRC legal counsel that,
	as these circulars and rules are relatively new and as there is a lack of clear statutory interpretation on the implementation of the same, there is no assurance that MOFCOM will have the same view as we do when applying these national security

	These contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. The legal

	Pursuant to the Equity Pledge Agreements with the shareholders of
	Shanghai IT, such shareholders agreed to pledge their equity interests in Shanghai IT to secure their performance under the relevant contractual arrangements. The equity pledges of Shanghai IT under these Equity Pledge Agreements have been
	registered with the relevant local administration for industry and commerce pursuant to the new PRC Property Rights Law. According to the PRC Property Rights Law and PRC Guarantee Law, the pledgee and the pledgor are prohibited from making an
	agreement prior to the expiration of the debt performance period to transfer the ownership of the pledged equity to the pledgee when the obligor fails to pay the debt due. However, under the PRC Property Rights Law, when an obligor fails to pay its
	debt when due, the pledgee may choose to either conclude an agreement with the pledgor to obtain the pledged equity or seek payments from the proceeds of the auction or sell-off of the pledged equity. If Shanghai IT or its shareholders fail to
	perform their obligations secured by the pledges under the Equity Pledge Agreements, one remedy in the event of default under the agreements is to require the pledgors to sell the equity interests of Shanghai IT in an auction or private sale and

	otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of other countries or regions. While the Tax Agreement between the PRC and Hong Kong provides dividends paid by a
	foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC to its corporate shareholder, which is considered a Hong Kong tax resident, will be subject to withholding tax at the rate of 5% of total dividends, this is limited to instances where the corporate shareholder
	directly holds at least 25% of the shares of the company that is to pay dividends for at least twelve consecutive months immediately prior to receiving the dividends and meets certain other criteria prescribed by the relevant regulations.

	not be qualified for treaty benefits. A conduit company normally refers to a company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits. In June 2012, SAT further promulgated the Announcement on

	In addition, the EIT Law

	&#147;management organ&#148; is defined as &#147;an organ which has substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operation, personnel, accounting, properties and other factors.&#148; On April 22, 2009, the SAT
	further issued a notice regarding recognizing an offshore-established enterprise controlled by PRC shareholders as a resident enterprise according to its management organ, or Circular 82. According to Circular 82, a foreign enterprise controlled by

	us or any gains realized from the transfer of our shares or ADSs if we are deemed to be a resident enterprise or if such income is otherwise regarded as income from &#147;sources within the PRC.&#148; The EIT Law empowers the PRC State Council to

	indirect transfer satisfying all the following criteria shall be deemed to lack reasonable commercial purpose and be taxable under the PRC laws: (i) 75% or more of the equity value of the intermediary enterprise being transferred is derived directly
	or indirectly from the PRC taxable properties; (ii) at any time during the one year period before the indirect transfer, 90% or more of the asset value of the intermediary enterprise (excluding cash) is comprised directly or indirectly of
	investments in the PRC, or 90% or more of its income is derived directly or indirectly from the PRC; (iii) the functions performed and risks assumed by the intermediary enterprise and any of its subsidiaries that directly or indirectly hold the PRC
	taxable properties are limited and are insufficient to prove their economic substance; and (iv) the foreign tax payable on the gains derived from the indirect transfer of the PRC taxable properties is lower than the potential PRC tax on the direct
	transfer of such assets. Nevertheless, the indirect transfer falling into the scope of the safe harbor under SAT Circular 7 may not be subject to PRC tax and such safe harbor includes qualified group restructuring, public market trading and tax
	treaty exemptions. Under SAT Circular 7, the entities or individuals obligated to pay the transfer price to the transferor shall be the withholding agent and shall withhold the PRC tax from the transfer price. If the withholding agent fails to do
	so, the transferor shall report to and pay the PRC tax to the PRC tax authorities. In case neither the withholding agent nor the transferor complies with the obligations under SAT Circular 7, other than imposing penalties such as late payment
	interest on the transferors, the tax authority may also hold the withholding agent liable and impose a penalty of 50% to 300% of the unpaid tax on the withholding agent, provided that such penalty imposed on the withholding agent may be reduced or
	waived if the withholding agent has submitted the relevant materials in connection with the indirect transfer to the PRC tax authorities in accordance with SAT Circular 7.

	Starting
	in 2011, the Chinese affiliates of the &#147;big four&#148; accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, were affected by a conflict between U.S. and Chinese law. Specifically, for certain U.S. listed companies
	operating and audited in China, the SEC and the PCAOB sought to obtain from the Chinese firms access to their audit work papers and related documents. The firms were, however, advised and directed that under China law they could not respond directly
	to the U.S. regulators on those requests, and such requests by foreign regulators for access to such papers in China had to be channeled through the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In late 2012, this impasse led the SEC to commence administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and also under the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 against the Chinese accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm. A first instance trial of the proceedings in July 2013 in the SEC&#146;s internal administrative court resulted in an
	adverse judgment against the firms. The administrative law judge proposed penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice before the SEC, although that proposed penalty did not take effect pending review by the
	commissioners of the SEC. On February 6, 2015, before a review by the commissioner had taken place, the firms reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the settlement, the SEC accepts that future requests by the SEC for the production of documents
	will normally be made to the CSRC. The firms will receive requests matching Section 106, and are required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such requests, which in substance require them to facilitate production via the CSRC.
	If they fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains the authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure. Remedies for any future noncompliance could include, as appropriate, an
	automatic six-month bar on a single firm&#146;s performance of certain audit work, commencement of a new proceeding against a firm, or in extreme cases the resumption of the current proceeding against all four firms.

	In the event that the SEC restarts the administrative proceedings, depending upon the final outcome, listed companies in the United States
	with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange
	Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about any such future proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding China-based, United States-listed companies and the market price of our ADSs may be

	caf&eacute;s, and required those remaining open to install software to prevent access to sites deemed subversive and required web portals to sign a pledge not to host subversive sites. Furthermore, the PRC government&#146;s policy, which encourages
	the development of a limited number of national and regional Internet caf&eacute; chains and discourages the establishment of independent Internet caf&eacute;s, may slow the overall growth of Internet caf&eacute;s. Currently, the issuance of
	Internet caf&eacute; licenses is subject to the overall planning of the Ministry of Culture and the local branches of the Ministry of Culture above certain level in respect of the total number and location of Internet caf&eacute;s. Since 2004, the
	grant of new Internet caf&eacute; licenses has been suspended from time to time, and was again suspended in 2007. The PRC government maintains strict controls on the granting of new licenses. As Internet caf&eacute;s are the primary venue for users
	to play our games, any reduction in the number, or any slowdown in the growth of, Internet caf&eacute;s in China will limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and expand our customer base, which will in turn materially and adversely
	affect our business and results of operations.

	We are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures. Our profit or loss in Red 5, a portion
	of our financial assets, and the Convertible Notes are denominated in U.S. dollars while currently a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in RMB, the legal currency in China. We have not used any forward contracts or currency
	borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk. The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and China&#146;s foreign
	exchange policies. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a managed band based on market supply and demand
	and by reference to a basket of certain foreign currencies. Since the change in policy in July 2005, the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted
	and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June&nbsp;2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or
	PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.

	currency-denominated obligations, such as paying license fees and royalty payments. The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in China is the Foreign Exchange Administration Rules (1996), as amended. Under such rules, the RMB is
	generally freely convertible for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loans or investment in securities outside China unless the prior approval of SAFE is obtained. Although the PRC government
	regulations now allow greater convertibility of RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain. For example, foreign exchange transactions under our PRC subsidiaries&#146; capital account, including principal payments in

	In January 2015, MOFCOM published a draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law, or Draft FIL. If enacted, the Draft FIL would replace the

	&#147;restricted&#148; or &#147;prohibited&#148; in a &#147;negative list&#148; will be subject to entry clearance and other approvals not required for PRC domestic entities unless such foreign invested enterprises can demonstrate that the ultimate
	controlling person(s) is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC citizen, or PRC government and its branches or agencies). Because the negative list has yet to be published, it is unclear whether it will differ from the current list of industries subject

	contractual arrangements.

	and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&amp;A Rules, and the Anti-Monopoly Law and the MOFCOM Security Review Rules. In some instances, MOFCOM needs to be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in
	which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. The approval by MOFCOM may also need to be obtained in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises or residents acquire affiliated domestic
	companies. PRC laws and regulations also require certain merger and acquisition transactions to be subject to merger control review or security review. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules, effective from September 1, 2011, provide that, when deciding

	If our shareholders sell or are perceived by the market to sell substantial amounts of our ADSs, including
	those issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, in the public market, the market price of our ADSs could fall. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price
	that we deem appropriate. If any existing shareholder or shareholders sell or are perceived by the market to sell a substantial amount of ordinary shares, the prevailing market price for our ADSs could be adversely affected. In December 2015, we
	issued and sold the Convertible Notes in an aggregate principal amount of US$40,050,000 to Spendid Days in three tranches at initial conversion prices of US$2.6, US$5.2 and US$7.8 per ADS, respectively. In connection with the sale of Convertible
	Notes, we also issued the Warrants in an aggregate principal amount of US$9,950,000 to Splendid Days in four tranches at initial exercise prices of US$1.5, US$2.6, US$5.2 and US$7.8 per ADS, respectively. See &#147;Item 5&#151;Operating and
	Financial Review and Prospects&#151;B. Liquidity and Capital Resources&#151;Cash Flows and Working Capital.&#148; We will register the ordinary shares into which the Convertible Notes are convertible and the Warrants are exercisable on a
	registration statement on F-3, and use our best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as possible after the initial filing. Upon registration, any ordinary shares that Splendid Days would
	acquire by conversion of the Convertible Notes or exercise of the Warrants will become freely tradable.

	CrossFire 2.
</I>
	In November 2015, our joint venture Oriental Shiny obtained an exclusive license from Smilegate to publish and operate CrossFire 2 in China for an initial term of three years, subject to an extension
	to five years. CrossFire 2 is the sequel of CrossFire, a first-person-shooter PC online game in China. Smilegate is currently in the process of developing CrossFire 2. We do not consolidate the results of Oriental Shiny into our results of
	operations and treat it as an equity investee. See &#147;&#151;Arrangements with Smilegate regarding CrossFire 2.&#148;

	In July 2006, MIIT issued the MII Notice. The MII Notice prohibits ICP license holders from
	leasing, transferring or selling a telecommunications business operating license to any foreign investors in any form, or providing any resource, sites or facilities to any foreign investors for their illegal operation of telecommunications
	businesses in China. The notice also requires that ICP license holders and their shareholders directly own the domain names and trademarks used by such ICP license holders in their daily operations. The notice further requires each ICP license
	holder to have the necessary facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all the value-added telecommunication service providers are required to maintain network
	and information security in accordance with the standards set forth under relevant PRC regulations. The local authorities in charge of telecommunications services are required to ensure that existing ICP license holders conduct a self-assessment of
	their compliance with the MII Notice and submit status reports to MIIT before November 1, 2006. For those which are not in compliance with the above requirements and further fail to rectify the situation, the relevant governmental authorities would
	have broad discretion to adopt one or more measures against them, including but not limited to revoking their operating licenses. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors &#151;Risks Related to Our Company and Our Industry&#151;PRC
	laws and regulations restrict foreign ownership of Internet content provision, Internet culture operation and network publication service licenses, and substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the application and implementation of PRC laws

	Under these regulations, a foreign investor is currently prohibited from owning more than 50% of the equity
	interest in a PRC entity that provides value-added telecommunications services (except for e-commerce services). ICP services are classified as value-added telecommunications businesses, and a commercial operator of such services must obtain an ICP
	License from the appropriate telecommunications authorities in order to carry on any commercial ICP operations in China.

	With respect to
	the online gaming industry in China, since online games fall into the definition of &#147;Internet culture products&#148; under The Tentative Measures for Administration of Internet Culture (2011), a commercial operator of online games must, in
	addition to obtaining the ICP License, obtain an Internet culture operation license from the appropriate culture administrative authorities for its operation of online games. Furthermore, according to The Tentative Measures for Administration of
	Internet Publication (2002), the provision of online games is deemed an Internet publication activity. Therefore, approval from the appropriate press and publication administrative authorities as an Internet publisher or cooperation with a licensed
	Internet publisher is required for an online game operator to carry on its online gaming businesses in China. In February 2016, the GAPPRFT and the MIIT jointly issued the Administrative Measures on Network Publication, which took effect in March
	2016 and replaced the Tentative Administrative Measures on Internet Publication. The Administrative Measures on Network Publication further strengthen and expand the supervision and management on the network publication service, including online
	games service. Furthermore, online games, including mobile games, regardless of whether imported or domestic, shall be subject to a content review and approval by or a filing with the Ministry of Culture and GAPPRFT prior to commencement of
	operations in China.

	GAPPRFT and MIIT jointly impose a license requirement for any company that intends to engage in network publishing,
	defined as any activity of providing network publications to the public through information networks. Network publications refer to the digitalized works with publishing features such as editing, producing and processing. Furthermore, the
	distribution of online game cards and CD-keys for online gaming programs is subject to a licensing requirement. Shanghai IT holds the license necessary to distribute electronic publications, which allows it to distribute prepaid cards and CD-Keys
	for the games we operate. We sell our prepaid cards and CD-Keys through third-party distributors, which are responsible for maintaining requisite licenses for distributing our prepaid cards and CD Keys in China.

	On February 15, 2007, fourteen governmental authorities, including the Ministry of Culture, MIIT, the State Administration for Industry and
	Commerce, and the People&#146;s Bank of China, or the PBOC, jointly issued a circular entitled Circular for Further Strengthening the Administration of Internet Caf&eacute; and Online Games. This circular gave the PBOC administrative authority over
	virtual currencies issued by online game operators for use by players in online games to avoid the potential impact such virtual currencies may have on the real-world financial systems. According to this circular, the volume that may be issued and
	the purchase of such virtual currencies must be restricted, and virtual currency must not be used for the purchase of any physical products, refunded with a premium or otherwise illegally traded. The Notice of Strengthening the Management of Virtual
	Currency of Online Games promulgated by the Ministry of Culture and MOFCOM on June 4, 2009 and the Tentative Measures for Administration of Online Games promulgated by the Ministry of Culture on June 3, 2010 impose more restrictions and requirements
	on online game operators that issue virtual currencies. According to the above regulations, an online game operator which issues virtual currency used for online game services shall apply for approval from the Ministry of Culture. An online game
	operator shall further report detailed rules of issuance for virtual currencies, such as distribution scope, pricing, and terms for refunds and shall make certain periodic and supplementary filings as required by the relevant regulations. In
	addition, under the new rules, online game operators are prohibited from assigning game tools or virtual currency to users by way of drawing lots, random samplings or other arbitrary means in exchange for users&#146; cash or virtual currency. The
	new rules also require that service agreements entered into between online game operators and end users contain the general terms of a standard online game service agreement issued by the Ministry of Culture.

	In September 2009, GAPP further promulgated the GAPP Circular, which provides that foreign
	investors are prohibited from making investment and engaging in online game operation services by setting up foreign-invested enterprises in China. Further, foreign investors shall not control and participate in PRC online game operation businesses
	indirectly or in a disguised manner by establishing joint venture companies or entering into agreements with or providing technical support to such PRC online game operation companies, or by inputting the users&#146; registration, account
	management, game cards consumption directly into the interconnected gaming platform or fighting platform controlled or owned by the foreign investor. It is not clear whether the regulatory authority of GAPPRFT applies to the regulation of ownership
	structures of online game companies based in China and online game operation in China. Other government agencies that have regulatory jurisdiction over the online game operations in China, such as the Ministry of Culture and MIIT, did not join GAPP
	in issuing the GAPP Circular. To date, GAPPRFT has not issued any interpretation of the GAPP Circular. It is not yet clear how this GAPP Circular will be implemented. The relevant governmental authorities have broad discretion to adopt one or more
	of administrative measures against companies now in compliance with these measures, including revoking relevant licenses and relevant registration. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Company and Our

	In April 2007, various governmental authorities, including GAPP, MIIT, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Security, and other
	relevant authorities jointly issued a circular concerning the mandatory implementation of an &#147;anti-fatigue system&#148; in online games, which was aimed at protecting the physical and psychological health of minors. This circular required all
	online games to incorporate an &#147;anti-fatigue system&#148; and an identity verification system, both of which have limited the amount of time that a minor or other user may continuously spend playing an online game. We have implemented such
	&#147;anti-fatigue&#148; and identification systems on all of our online games as required. Since March 2011, various governmental authorities, including the Ministry of Culture, MIIT, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Security, and
	other relevant authorities have jointly launched the &#147;Online Game Parents Guardianship Project for Minors,&#148; which allows parents to require online game operators to take relevant measures to limit the time spent by the minors on playing
	online games and the minors&#146; access to their online game accounts. On February 5, 2013, the Ministry of Culture, MIIT, GAPP and various other governmental authorities, jointly issued the Working Plan on the Comprehensive Prevention Scheme on
	Online Game Addiction of Minors, which further strengthened the administration of the Internet caf&eacute;s, reinstated the importance of the &#147;anti-fatigue system&#148; and &#147;Online Game Parents Guardianship Project for Minors&#148; as
	prevention measures against the online game addiction of minors and ordered all relevant governmental authorities to take all necessary actions in implementing such measures. Additional requirements for anti-fatigue and identification systems in our
	games, as well as the implementation of any other measures required by any new regulations the PRC government may enact to further tighten its administration of the Internet and online games, and its supervision of Internet caf&eacute;s, may limit
	or slow down our prospects for growth, or may materially and adversely affect our business results. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#151;Our business may be adversely affected by

	Pursuant
	to the Foreign Exchange Administration Rules (1996), as amended in 1997 and 2008, the RMB is generally freely convertible for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loans, investment in securities, or
	other transactions through a capital account outside China unless the prior approval of SAFE is obtained. Furthermore, foreign investment enterprises in China in general may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of SAFE for trade and
	service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. Foreign investment enterprises that need foreign exchange for the distribution of profits to their shareholders may effect payment from
	their foreign exchange account or purchase and pay foreign exchange at the designated foreign exchange banks to their foreign shareholders by producing board resolutions for such profit distribution. Under the Administration Rules of the Settlement,
	Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), based on their needs, foreign investment enterprises are permitted to open foreign exchange settlement accounts for current account receipts and payments of foreign exchange along with specialized
	accounts for capital account receipts and payments of foreign exchange at certain designated foreign exchange banks.

	Circular 59 were that the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts (e.g. pre-establishment expenses account, foreign exchange capital account, guarantee account) no longer required the approval of SAFE. Furthermore, multiple
	capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible before the issuance of SAFE Circular 59. Reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC no longer required SAFE approval or verification,
	and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer required SAFE approval.

	On July 4, 2014, SAFE issued SAFE Circular 37, which is the Circular on Several Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration
	of Domestic Residents Engaging in Overseas Investment, Financing and Round-Trip Investment via Special Purpose Vehicles. SAFE Circular 37 and its detailed guidelines require PRC residents to register with the local branch of SAFE before contributing
	their legally owned onshore or offshore assets or equity interest into any SPV directly established, or indirectly controlled, by them for the purpose of investment or financing. In addition, when there is (a) any change to the basic information of
	the SPV, such as any change relating to its individual PRC resident shareholders, name or operation period or (b) any material change, such as increase or decrease in the share capital held by its individual PRC resident shareholders, a share
	transfer or exchange of the shares in the SPV, or a merger or split of the SPV, the PRC resident must register such changes with the local branch of SAFE on a timely basis. According to the relevant SAFE rules, failure to comply with the
	registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore companies of SPVs, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore
	parent or affiliate and the capital inflow from such offshore entity, and may also subject the relevant PRC residents and onshore companies to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. Further, failure to comply with various
	SAFE registration requirements described above would result in liability for foreign exchange evasion under PRC laws. On February 13, 2015, SAFE issued SAFE Circular 13, which is the Circular on Further Simplifying and Improving the Foreign Exchange
	Administration Policies on Direct Investments, which took effect on June 1, 2015. Under SAFE Circular 13, qualified banks are delegated the power to register all PRC residents&#146; investments in SPVs pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, saving for
	supplementary registration application made by PRC residents who failed to comply with SAFE Circular 37, which shall still fall into the jurisdiction of the local branch of SAFE.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of the uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of SAFE Circular 37 and SAFE Circular 13, we cannot predict
	how these regulations will affect our business operations or strategies. For example, our present or future PRC subsidiaries&#146; ability to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated
	borrowings, may be subject to compliance with such SAFE registration requirements by relevant PRC residents, over whom we have no control. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such PRC residents will be able to complete the necessary approval
	and registration procedures required by the SAFE regulations. We have requested all of our shareholders who, based on our knowledge, are PRC residents or whose ultimate beneficial owners are PRC residents to comply with all applicable SAFE
	registration requirements, but we have no control over our shareholders. We cannot assure you that the PRC beneficial owners of our company and our subsidiaries have completed the required SAFE registrations. Nor can we assure you that they will be
	in full compliance with the SAFE registration in the future. Any non-compliance by the PRC beneficial owners of our company and our subsidiaries may subject us or such PRC resident shareholders to fines and other penalties. It may also limit our
	ability to contribute additional capitals to our PRC subsidiaries and our subsidiaries&#146; ability to distribute profits or make other payments to us.

	Online Game Services
</I>
	. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, revenues from our online game services amounted to
	RMB95.1 million, RMB55.4 million and RMB40.5 million (US$6.3 million), respectively. We primarily generate our online game service revenues through item-based revenue models. Under an item-based revenue model, players of our games play the games for
	free, but are charged for purchases of in-game items, such as performance-enhancing items, clothing and accessories. Thus, we generate revenues through the sale of such in-game premium features that players use game points to purchase. The
	distribution of points to end users is typically made through sales of prepaid game cards and prepaid online points. Fees from prepaid game cards and prepaid online points are deferred when initially received. This revenue is recognized over the
	life of the premium features or as the premium features are consumed. Future usage patterns may differ from the historical usage patterns on which the virtual items and services consumption model is based. We will continue to monitor the operational
	statistics and usage patterns affecting our recognition of these revenues.

	are only permitted to pay dividends out of their respective accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations; and (ii) these entities are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective
	accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain capital reserves until the cumulative total of the allocated reserves reach 50% of registered capital, and a portion of their respective after-tax profits to their staff welfare and bonus
	reserve funds as determined by their respective boards of directors. These reserves are not distributable as dividends. See &#147;Item 4. Information on the Company&#151;B. Business Overview&#151;Government Regulations.&#148; In addition, failure to
	comply with relevant SAFE regulations may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments to us. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Doing Business in China &#151;PRC regulations relating

	Our subsidiaries and affiliated entities in the PRC that hold a HNTE qualification are entitled to enjoy a 15% preferential EIT rate.

	In
	addition, under the EIT Law, enterprises organized under the laws of their respective jurisdictions outside the PRC may be classified as either &#147;non-resident enterprises&#148; or &#147;resident enterprises.&#148; Non-resident enterprises are
	subject to withholding tax at the rate of 20% with respect to their PRC-sourced dividend income if they have no establishment or place of business in the PRC or if such income is not related to their establishment or place of business in the PRC,
	unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of other countries or regions. The State Council has reduced the withholding tax rate to 10% in the newly promulgated
	implementation rules of the EIT Law. As we are incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we may be regarded as a &#147;non-resident enterprise.&#148; We hold equity interests in certain PRC subsidiaries through subsidiaries in Hong Kong. According to the
	Tax Agreement between the PRC and Hong Kong, dividends paid by a foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC to its corporate shareholder in Hong Kong holding 25% or more of its equity interest may be subject to withholding tax at the maximum rate of 5%
	if certain criteria are met. Entitlement to such lower tax rate on dividends according to tax treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions is further subject to approval of relevant tax
	authority.

	Furthermore, the SAT promulgated Circular 601 which provides guidance for determining whether a resident of a contracting
	state is the &#147;beneficial owner&#148; of an Item of income under China&#146;s tax treaties and tax arrangements. According to Circular 601, a beneficial owner generally must be engaged in substantial business activities. An agent or conduit
	company will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and, therefore, will not qualify for treaty benefits. The conduit company normally refers to a company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating
	profits. In June 2012, SAT further promulgated Circular 30 which provides that the tax authorities shall make the decision based on comprehensive consideration of all determining factors provided in Circular 601 rather than the status of a single
	determining factor. We cannot assure you that any dividends to be distributed by us or by our subsidiaries to our non-PRC shareholders and ADS holders whose jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China providing a different withholding
	arrangement will be entitled to the benefits under the relevant withholding arrangement.

	The EIT law deems an enterprise established offshore but having its management organ in the PRC

	PRC laws and regulations, including the GAPP Circular, currently prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of Internet-related businesses. We
	believe, consistent with the view of our PRC legal counsel, that our current structure complies with these foreign ownership restrictions, subject to the interpretation and implementation of the GAPP Circular. Specifically, we operate our business
	through Shanghai IT and have entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Shanghai IT and its equity owners. See the contractual arrangements set forth in &#147;Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions&#151;B. Related
	Party Transactions.&#148; As a result of these contractual arrangements, we are entitled to receive service fees for services provided to Shanghai IT for an amount determined at our discretion, up to 90% of PRC entities&#146; profits. In addition,
	the equity owners of record for these entities have pledged all their equity interests in the VIEs to us as collateral for all of their payments due to the wholly-owned foreign enterprise, or WOFE, and to secure performance of all obligations of the
	VIEs and their shareholders under various agreements. In addition, the agreements provide that any dividend distributions made by the VIEs, if any, are required to be deposited in an escrow account over which we have exclusive control. Moreover,
	through the Call Option Agreements and Shareholder Voting Proxy Agreements, each shareholder of the VIEs granted WOFE or any third parties designated by the WFOE an irrevocable power of attorney to act on all matters pertaining to the VIEs. We
	believe that the terms of the Call Option Agreements are currently exercisable and legally enforceable under the PRC laws and regulations. We also believe that the minimum amount of consideration permitted by the applicable PRC law to exercise the
	options does not represent a financial barrier or disincentive for us to exercise our rights under the Call Option Agreements. A simple majority vote of our board of directors is required to pass a resolution to exercise our rights under the Call
	Option Agreements, for which consent of the shareholder of the VIEs is not required. As a result of the totality of these arrangements, we have both the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the
	obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the VIEs that are significant to Shanghai IT. As a result, we concluded we are the primary beneficiary of Shanghai IT and as such Shanghai IT is consolidated VIE of our company.

	The GAPP Circular reiterates and reinforces the long-standing prohibition of foreign ownership of Internet-related publication businesses via
	direct, indirect or disguised methods. However, it is not clear whether the regulatory authority of GAPPRFT applies to the regulation of ownership structures of online game companies based in China and online game operation in China. In addition,
	the GAPP Circular does not specifically invalidate VIE agreements, and we are not aware of any online game companies adopting similar contractual arrangements as ours having been penalized or ordered to terminate such arrangements since the GAPP
	Circular first became effective. Therefore, we believe that our ability to direct the activities of Shanghai IT that most significantly impact our economic performance is not affected by the GAPP Circular. Any changes in PRC laws and regulations
	that affect our ability to control Shanghai IT might preclude us from consolidating Shanghai IT in the future. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Company and Our Industry&#151;PRC laws and regulations
	restrict foreign ownership of Internet content provision, Internet culture operation and network publication service licenses, and substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the application and implementation of PRC laws and regulations.&#148;

	Goodwill represents the

	circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. In December of each year, we test impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level and recognize impairment in the event that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of each reporting unit.
	Goodwill impairment assessment requires significant judgment, including assumptions used to determine the fair value of the reporting units. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows
	of the reporting units. If the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value, step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. Any
	excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss. After completing our annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of 2013,

	its terms are modified, measured based on the share price and other pertinent factors at that date. We recognize the compensation costs, net of the estimated forfeiture, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award, which generally
	ranges from one to four years. Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical forfeiture patterns and adjusted to reflect future changes in circumstances and facts, if any. If actual forfeitures differ from those estimates, the estimates may be
	revised in subsequent periods. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.

	Determining the fair value of stock options requires significant judgment. We measure the fair
	value of the stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with assumptions made regarding expected term, volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The expected term represents the period of time that the awards granted
	are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is determined based on historical data on employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior, or the &#147;simplified&#148; method for stock option awards with the characteristics of
	&#147;plain vanilla&#148; options for 2010 and 2011. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our ordinary shares. Risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government bonds issued with maturity terms similar to the expected term
	of the stock-based awards. While we paid a discretionary cash dividend in January 2009, we do not anticipate paying any recurring cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

	In addition, on December 8, 2010, we granted 1,500,000 ordinary shares to Jun Zhu, our chairman and chief executive officer, which will only
	be vested if our company achieves certain income targets and the shares are not entitled to receive dividends until they become vested. Of such shares, 500,000 ordinary shares were vested and issued to Incsight Limited, a company wholly owned by Jun
	Zhu, on November 17, 2015. We considered the grant of ordinary shares as an incentive to retain Mr. Jun Zhu&#146;s services with our company. The awarded non-vested shares would be valid for five years from December 8, 2010. The fair value of the
	granted non-vested shares is US$6.48 per share, the market price on the date of grant. We record share-based compensation expenses for these performance-based awards based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance
	period (i.e., the estimated performance against the performance targets). We periodically adjust the cumulative share-based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual
	and forecasted operating results. Our actual performance against the performance targets could differ materially from our estimates.

	We review long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
	of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets and intangible assets (other than goodwill) by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow associated with the
	related assets. We recognize impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets in the event that the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flow attributable to such assets. We use estimates and judgment in
	our impairment tests, and if different estimates or judgments had been utilized, the timing or the amount of the impairment charges could be different. Impairment charges relating to equipment amounting to RMB1.9 million, nil and nil were recognized
	in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Impairment charges relating to intangible assets and other assets amounting to RMB3.8 million, RMB3.6 million and RMB8.4 million (US$1.3 million) were recognized in 2013, 2014 and 2015,

	As a result of non-renewal of WoW license on June 7, 2009, we announced a refund plan in connection with unactivated WoW game
	point cards. According to the plan, unactivated WoW game point card holders are eligible to receive a cash refund from us. We recorded a liability in connection with both unactivated points cards and activated but unconsumed point cards of
	approximately RMB200.4 million, of which RMB4.0 million was refunded in 2009. Upon the loss of the WoW license, we concluded that the nature of the obligation substantively changed from deferred revenue, for which we had the ability to satisfy the
	underlying performance obligation, to an obligation to refund players for their unconsumed points. Thus, we have accounted for this refund liability by applying the relevant derecognition guidance when determining the proper accounting treatment. In
	accordance with this guidance, the refund liability associated with these WoW game points, to the extent not refunded, will be recorded as other operating income after we are legally released from the obligation to refund amounts under the
	applicable laws. As we announced the refund plan on September 7, 2009, the statute of limitations of the creditors (in this case the game players with claims for refund of unactivated WoW game point cards) to assert their claims for refund is two
	years from such date under applicable laws and thus our legal liability relating to the unactivated WoW game point cards was extinguished on September 7, 2011 and the associated liability amounting to RMB26.0 million was recognized as other
	operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011. With respect to the remaining refund liability, based on current PRC laws, to the extent not refunded, we, in consultation with legal counsel, have determined that we will be legally released
	from this liability in 2029, which represents 20 years from the date of discontinuation of WoW in 2009. However, if management were to publicly announce a refund policy, we would be legally released from any remaining liability for these activated,
	but unconsumed points, sooner than 20 years. To date, we have determined not to publicly announce any refund policy with respect to this remaining liability, and no refunds have been claimed. The remaining refund liability relating to the activated,
	but unconsumed WoW game points was RMB170.0 million (US$26.2 million) as of December 31, 2015.

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update on revenue
	recognition that will be applied to all contracts with customers. The update requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or
	services. It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued
	ASU No. 2015-14, deferring the effective date for ASU 2014-09 by one year, and thus, the new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted only as of annual reporting periods
	beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The guidance allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method. We are currently assessing the impact that the

	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 to respond to
	stakeholders&#146; concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities. Stakeholders expressed concerns that current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) might require a reporting entity to consolidate
	another legal entity in situations in which the reporting entity&#146;s contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entity&#146;s voting rights, or the
	reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entity&#146;s economic benefits or obligations. Financial statement users asserted that in certain of those situations in which consolidation is ultimately required, deconsolidated financial
	statements are necessary to better analyze the reporting entity&#146;s economic and operational results. Previously, the FASB issued an indefinite deferral for certain entities to partially address those concerns. However, the amendments in this
	update rescind that deferral and address those concerns by making changes to the consolidation guidance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We are in
	the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.

	We are a holding company and conduct our
	operations primarily through our subsidiaries and affiliated PRC entities in China. As a result, our cash requirements and our ability to pay dividends principally depend upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, which in turn
	are derived principally from earnings generated by our affiliated PRC entities. Specifically, The9 Computer (one of our subsidiaries in China) obtains funds from the PRC entities in the form of payments under the exclusive technical service
	agreements, pursuant to which The9 Computer is entitled to determine the amount of payment.

	We acknowledge that the PRC government
	imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies, and in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. However, under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit
	distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, we are able to pay dividends in foreign
	currencies without prior approval from SAFE. Approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment
	of loans denominated in foreign currencies.

	Furthermore, if our subsidiaries or any newly formed subsidiaries incur debt on their own
	behalf, the agreements governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information &#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#151;Restrictions on currency exchange in China
	limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively, make dividend payments and meet our foreign currency denominated obligations.&#148;

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Current PRC regulations restrict our affiliated entities and subsidiaries from paying dividends in the following two principal aspects: (i)
	our affiliated entities and subsidiaries in China are only permitted to pay dividends out of their respective accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations; and (ii) these entities are required
	to allocate at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain capital reserves until the cumulative total of the allocated reserves reaches 50% of registered capital, and a portion of their respective after-tax
	profits to their staff welfare and bonus reserve funds as determined by their respective boards of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of
	retained earnings of the respective companies, companies may not distribute the reserve funds as cash dividends except upon a liquidation of these subsidiaries. In addition, dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries could be delayed as we may only
	distribute such dividends upon completion of annual statutory audits of the subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, such restricted portion was RMB23.3 million (US$3.6&nbsp;million). We have not directed our PRC subsidiaries or affiliated entities to
	distribute any dividends to-date.

	The aggregate net assets as of December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, as reflected on our statutory
	accounts, including registered capital and statutory reserves, was approximately RMB67.0 million and RMB75.6 million and RMB97.9 million (US$15.1 million) lower than the amount determined under U.S. GAAP, respectively.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We financed our operations primarily through our available cash in hand as well as cash generated from our operating, financing and investing
	activities. As of December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, we had RMB157.0 million, RMB181.5 million and RMB49.0 million (US$7.6 million), respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in the cash and cash equivalents from 2014 to 2015 was
	primarily due to cash outflows to finance capital investment in a joint venture and operating activities for product development and sales and marketing, offset by net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Convertible Notes to Splendid Days and
	the entrusted loan provided by a third party in December 2015. The increase in the cash and cash equivalents from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the net effect of cash consideration received from the disposal of Huopu Cloud and the proceeds from
	the investment made by Shanghai Oriental Pearl Culture Development Co., Ltd. in Red 5 offset by the net cash outflow from operating activities for product development and sales and marketing.

	We have an accumulated deficit of approximately RMB2,304 million (US$355.7 million) as of December 31, 2015, a net loss of approximately
	RMB354.2 million (US$54.7 million) for the year ended December 31, 2015, and have not generated significant revenues or positive cash flows from operations since 2009. We expect to continue to incur product development and sales and marketing
	expenses for licensed and proprietary new games in order to achieve revenue growth. To meet our capital needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including but not limited to additional equity financings, debt financings, other financing
	transactions, and cost control, which are discussed below.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In March 2016, we entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding, or MOU, with L&amp;A International Holding Limited, or L&amp;A, a
	Cayman Islands company with shares publicly listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and certain other shareholders of Red 5. Pursuant to the MOU, we have agreed to exchange approximately 30.6% equity interest that we
	own in Red 5 for such number of newly issued shares of L&amp;A which has the same value as the exchanged Red 5 equity interest. The other participating shareholders of Red 5 will exchange an aggregate of approximately 14.4% equity interest in Red 5
	based on the same terms.&nbsp;The total valuation for the 45% equity interest in Red 5 subject to this exchange is expected to be approximately US$76.5 million, subject to adjustments by no more than 15% based on the results of due diligence
	exercises to be conducted by both parties.&nbsp;The completion of the transaction is subject to the parties&#146; execution of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions to be stipulated therein.&nbsp;If the transaction is completed in
	accordance with valuation of the MOU, we expect to receive ordinary shares of L&amp;A with a valuation ranging from US$44 million to US$60 million.&nbsp;We expect these shares to be publicly traded and can be traded with any restriction in the
	public market in Hong Kong.&nbsp;As a result, we believe that the completion of this transaction can provide a source of funding for our operations.

	Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of US$40,050,000 to Splendid Days Limited, or Splendid Days. We received net proceeds of US$36,850,000 from the sale of the Convertible Notes.&nbsp;The Convertible Notes are divided for three
	tranches in principal amounts of US$22,250,000, US$13,350,000 and US$4,450,000, respectively, which will be convertible at the option of the holder at any time into our ADSs at initial conversion prices of US$2.6, US$5.2 and US$7.8 per ADS,
	respectively, provided that at no time shall the holder convert any portion of the Convertible Notes if subsequent to such conversion such holder will hold more than 20% of the total outstanding and issued shares of our company. The Convertibles
	Notes bear interest at a rate of 12% per year, payable when the principal amount of the Convertible Notes becomes due, and have initial terms of three years, subject to an extension for two years at the discretion of the holder.&nbsp;The initial
	conversion prices are subject to adjustments for share splits, reverse splits, share dividends and distributions, and certain issuances (or deemed issuances) of ordinary shares or ADSs for consideration less than the conversion price then in effect.

	Pursuant to the same agreement, on December 11, 2015, we issued to Splendid Days four tranches of warrants in an aggregate principal amount of

	deemed issuances) of ordinary shares or ADSs for consideration less than the exercise price then in effect, as applicable for each warrant. In addition, the holder of the Warrants with initial exercise prices of US$2.6, US$5.2 and US$7.8 per ADS is
	entitled to any cash dividend (to the extent that it exceeds the notional interest amount attributable to such Warrants) and dividend in kind that we distribute based on the number of shares into which the Warrants are then exercisable. The tranche
	of Warrants with an exercise price of US$1.5 per ADS has a term of five years, while the remaining three tranches have initial terms of three years, subject to an extension for two years if the holder exercises its discretion to extend the term of
	the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are secured by a pledge of our 100% equity interests in two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, including The9 Computer and C9I Shanghai, and a mortgage over our office building in Shanghai which
	we currently use as our principal executive offices.&nbsp;Pursuant to the agreement, we will register the ordinary shares into which the Convertible Notes are convertible and the Warrants are exercisable on a registration statement on F-3, and use

	As a result of non-renewal of WoW license on June 7, 2009, we announced a refund plan in
	connection with unactivated WoW game point cards. According to the plan, unactivated WoW game point card holders are eligible to receive a cash refund from us. We recorded a liability in connection with both unactivated points cards and activated
	but unconsumed point cards of approximately RMB200.4 million, of which RMB4.0 million was refunded in 2009. Upon the loss of the WoW license, we concluded that the nature of the obligation substantively changed from deferred revenue, for which we
	had the ability to satisfy the underlying performance obligation, to an obligation to refund players for their unconsumed points. Thus, we have accounted for this refund liability by applying the relevant derecognition guidance when determining the
	proper accounting treatment. In accordance with this guidance, the refund liability associated with these WoW game points, to the extent not refunded, will be recorded as other operating income after we are legally released from the obligation to
	refund amounts under the applicable laws. As we announced the refund plan on September 7, 2009, the statute of limitations of the creditors (in this case the game players with claims for refund of unactivated WoW game point cards) to assert their
	claims for refund is two years from such date under applicable laws and thus our legal liability relating to the unactivated WoW game point cards was extinguished on September 7, 2011 and the associated liability amounting to RMB26.0 million was
	recognized as other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011. With respect to the remaining refund liability, based on current PRC laws, to the extent not refunded, we, in consultation with legal counsel, have determined that we will be
	legally released from this liability in 2029, which represents 20 years from the date of discontinuation of WoW in 2009. However, if management were to publicly announce a refund policy, we would be legally released from any remaining liability for
	these activated, but unconsumed points, sooner than 20 years. To date, we have determined not to publicly announce any refund policy with respect to this remaining liability, and no refunds have been claimed. The remaining refund liability relating
	to the activated, but unconsumed WoW game points was RMB170.0 million (US$26.2 million) as of December 31, 2015.

	Under Cayman Islands
	law, our directors have fiduciary duties to act honestly, in good faith and with a view to our best interests. Our directors also owe to our company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in
	the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required
	skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. In fulfilling their duty of care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to
	time. We have the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached.

	chief executive officer,&nbsp;was re-elected as a director at our 2013 annual general meeting and is serving a three-year term until the 2016 annual general meeting or until his successor is duly elected and qualified, whichever is

	elected and qualified, whichever is earlier.&nbsp;Upon expiration of the term of office of each class, succeeding directors in each class will be elected for a term of three years. Directors may be removed from office by ordinary resolution of

	In May 2011, Diego Maradona, a former Argentina soccer star, filed a lawsuit in the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People&#146;s Court against
	Shanghai IT and a third-party company in China, alleging that the defendants used his name and image in a web and social game operated by us without his authorization. In July 2011, the plaintiff amended his complaint to include The9 Computer as a
	defendant. The plaintiff in the case demanded, among others, that the defendants pay RMB20 million for his alleged losses. In June 2013, the Beijing No.1 People&#146;s Intermediate Court issued a judgment against us for infringing the portraiture
	right of the plaintiff and required us to pay a total of RMB3 million as economic damages and other related fees to the plaintiff. We have appealed the case to the Beijing People&#146;s Superior Court. A hearing was held by the court on December 26,
	2013 and the court made a decision rejecting our appeal on April 10, 2014. We made a petition to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court accepted our petition on July 14, 2014. The Supreme Court made a decision upholding the Beijing No. 1
	Intermediate People&#146;s Court decision on December 16, 2014. According to the judgment, we shall pay to the plaintiff an aggregate amount of RMB3 million (US$0.5 million) and any accrued interests thereof for late payment. In February 2015, we

	On
	December 30, 2014, Shanghai Anjiu Network Information Limited, or Shanghai Anjiu, filed a lawsuit in Shanghai Pudong People&#146;s Court against Shanghai IT, claiming us for an advertisement fee of approximately RMB1.5 million and a penalty of
	RMB82,000. Shanghai IT and Shanghai Anjiu settled this case for paying a total of RMB1.4 million (US$0.2 million) to the plaintiff in January 2015.

	On September 30, 2015, a former employee who served as a human resources generalist of Red 5 filed a complaint before the Superior Court of
	California, County of Orange, against Red 5 and our company for wrongful termination of employment, and claimed general damages in excess of US$1.0 million and special damages in excess of US$0.5 million. On February 22, 2016, we submitted an answer
	to complaint and demand to the court to defend the action. We believe that such proceeding, when finally resolved, is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

	We currently intend to

	laws. Even if our board of directors determines to distribute dividends, the form, frequency and amount of our dividends will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual
	restrictions, legal restrictions and other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant. Any dividend we declare will be paid to the holders of ADSs, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, to the same extent as holders of our ordinary
	shares, less the fees and expenses payable under the deposit agreement. Any dividend we declare will be distributed by the depositary bank to the holders of our ADSs. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars.

	Directors&#146; Fiduciary Duties
</I>
</B>
	. Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the
	corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar
	circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he
	reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, he must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its
	shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good
	faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a
	transaction by a director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.

	As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a
	fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he owes the following duties to the company &#151; a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a personal profit out of his position
	as director (unless the company permits him to do so), a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his personal interest or his duty to a third party and a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for
	which such powers were intended. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill
	than may reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and experience. However, there are indications that the English and Commonwealth courts are moving towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these
	authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.

	Transactions with Interested Shareholders

</B>
	. The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute
	applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations
	with an &#147;interested shareholder&#148; for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target&#146;s
	outstanding voting stock within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquiror to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if,
	among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder.
	This encourages any potential acquiror of a Delaware public corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target&#146;s board of directors.

	The following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. Holders (as defined below) relating to the ownership

	If a partnership (or other entity taxable as a partnership for

	It is generally expected that a holder of ADSs should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the beneficial owner of the
	underlying shares represented by the ADSs. The remainder of this discussion assumes that a holder of ADSs will be treated in this manner. Predicated upon such treatment, deposits or withdrawals of our ordinary shares for our ADSs will not be subject
	to U.S. federal income tax. The U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that intermediaries in the chain of ownership between the holder of an ADS and the issuer of the security underlying the ADS may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the
	beneficial ownership of the underlying security (for example, pre-releasing ADSs to persons that do not have beneficial ownership of the securities underlying the ADSs). Accordingly, the creditability of any foreign tax credits or the availability
	of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individual U.S. Holders (as discussed below), could be affected by actions taken by intermediaries in the chain of ownership between the holders of ADSs
	and our company if as a result of such actions the holders of ADSs are not properly treated as beneficial owners of underlying ordinary shares.

	For this purpose, cash and assets readily convertible into cash are generally classified as
	passive assets and goodwill and other unbooked intangibles associated with active business activities may generally be classified as non-passive assets. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties and rents (other than certain
	royalties and rents derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and not derived from a related person), and gains from the disposition of passive assets. The classification of certain of our income as active or passive and certain of our
	assets as producing active or passive income, and hence whether we expect to be or will become a PFIC, depends on the interpretation of certain U.S. Treasury Regulations, including certain regulations relating to royalty income and income from
	intangible assets, as well as certain Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) guidance relating to the classification of assets as producing active or passive income and certain IRS guidance relating to the distinction between services income and
	royalties for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such regulations and guidance are potentially subject to different interpretations. If the percentage of our passive income or our assets treated as producing passive income increases, we may be more
	likely to be treated as a PFIC for such taxable year.

	We will be treated as owning our proportionate share of the assets and earning our
	proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, at least 25% (by value) of the stock. In applying this rule, however, it is not clear whether the contractual arrangements between us and our
	affiliated entities will be treated as ownership of stock. Moreover, it is not clear whether gain recognized from the sale of stock (or an arrangement treated as ownership of stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in a 25% (by value) or greater
	owned subsidiary (or VIE) is characterized as passive or as if we had held and sold directly our proportionate share of our subsidiary&#146;s (or VIE&#146;s) assets.

	Although the law in this regard is not clear, we treat our VIEs as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes because we exercise
	effective control over them and are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits. As a result, we consolidate the VIEs&#146; results of operations in our consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements. If it were determined that we are not
	the owner of our VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the composition of our income and assets would change and we may be more likely to be treated as a PFIC for any subsequent taxable year.

	We must make a separate determination after the close of each taxable year as to whether we were a PFIC for that year. Because the value of

	Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such item is defined in
	Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for our company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial
	statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of a company&#146;s assets,
	(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that a company&#146;s receipts and expenditures
	are being made only in accordance with authorizations of a company&#146;s management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company&#146;s
	assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Internal control over financial reporting cannot
	provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
	breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected
	on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this
	risk.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules as promulgated by the SEC, our management assessed the
	effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 using criteria established in &#147;Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013)&#148; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
	Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.

	However, Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5615(a)(3) permits foreign private issuers like us to follow &#147;home country practice&#148; with respect to certain corporate governance matters, and we may decide to follow the &#147;home country practice&#148;
	on a case-by-case basis. In November 2015, our board of directors approved an increase in the total number of ordinary shares reserved for issuance under our Option Plan, for which we have followed &#147;home country practice&#148; in lieu of
	obtaining a shareholder approval pursuant to Nasdaq Marketing Rule 5635(c). We are committed to a high standard of corporate governance. As such, we endeavor to comply with most of the Nasdaq corporate governance practices and believe that we are
	currently in compliance with the Nasdaq corporate governance practices.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The9 Limited:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The9 Limited, its subsidiaries and its variable interest entities (the
	&#147;Group&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and related
	financial statement schedule included in Schedule 1. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Group&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
	financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
	the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Group is not
	required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
	test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
	statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, such consolidated
	financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group at December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
	31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
	as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our audits also comprehended the translation of
	Renminbi amounts into United States dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made in conformity with the basis stated in Note 3.&nbsp;Such United States dollar amounts are presented solely for the convenience of readers in the
	United States of America.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Group will continue as
	a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group&#146;s recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations, along with other matters set forth in Note 2 in the consolidated financial
	statements, raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#146;s plans concerning these matters are also discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do
	not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles in the United States of America (&#147;US GAAP&#148;). Significant accounting policies followed by the Group in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accompanying consolidated&nbsp;financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group has accumulated deficit of approximately
	RMB2,304 million (US$355.7 million) as of December 31, 2015, a net loss of approximately RMB354.2 million (US$54.7 million) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Group expects to continue to incur product development, and sales and marketing
	expenses for licensed and proprietary new games in order to achieve overall revenue growth.&nbsp;These factors raise substantial doubt about the Group&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
	do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To meet its capital needs, the Group is considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, debt financings and
	other funding transactions as outlined below. There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to complete any such transaction on acceptable terms or otherwise. If the Group is unable to obtain the necessary capital, it will need to pursue a
	plan to license or sell its assets, seek to be acquired by another entity and/or cease operations.

	Sales of Equity Interest of Red 5
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In March 2016, the Group entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding (&#147;MOU&#148;) with L&amp;A International Holding Limited
	(&#147;L&amp;A&#148;), a Cayman Island Company with shares publicly listed in Hong Kong, and a certain other shareholder of Red 5 Studios, Inc. (&#147;Red 5&#148;).&nbsp;Under the terms of this MOU, the Group will exchange approximately 30.6% of its
	equity interest in Red 5 for such number of newly issued shares of L&amp;A of equivalent value based on a valuation agreed by all parties. The other participating shareholders of Red 5 will exchange an aggregate of approximately 14.4% equity
	interest in Red 5 based on the same terms.&nbsp;The total valuation for the 45% of equity interest in Red 5 subject to this exchange is expected to be approximately US$76.5 million, subject to adjustments by no more than 15% based on the results of
	due diligences conducted by both parties.&nbsp;The completion of the transaction is subject to the parties&#146; execution of definitive agreements and customary closing conditions to be stipulated therein. Should the transaction is to be completed
	in accordance with valuation of the MOU, the Group is expected to receive ordinary shares of L&amp;A with a valuation ranging between US$44 million to US$60 million.&nbsp;The Group expect these shares to be publicly traded and without restriction
	for sale in the public market in Hong Kong.&nbsp;As such, the Group believes the completion of this transaction can provide a source of funding for its operations.

	In March 2016, Bank of Shanghai (BOS) issued a commitment letter whereby BOS agrees to grant the Group a credit facility of RMB50 million (US$7.7 million). The
	Group can apply to withdraw the funding from BOS should they require liquidity for its operations. As of the report date, the Group had withdrawn RMB4.9 million (US$0.8 million) under this credit facility.

	When there is objective evidence that an available-for-sale investment is impaired, the cumulative losses from
	declines in fair value that had been recognized directly in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and recognized in earnings. When the available-for-sale investment is sold, the cumulative fair value adjustments previously recognized in
	accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in the current period operating results. When the Group determines that the impairment of an available-for-sale equity security is other-than-temporary, the Group recognizes an impairment loss in
	earnings equal to the difference between the investment&#146;s cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made. When other-than-temporary impairment has occurred for an available-for-sale
	debt security and the Group intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings
	equal to the difference between the investment&#146;s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. The new cost basis will not be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. To determine whether a loss is
	other-than-temporary, the Group reviews the cause and duration of the impairment, the extent to which fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the Group&#146;s intent and ability to hold the

	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and
	liabilities acquired as a result of the Group&#146;s business acquisition. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. In September 2011, the Financial
	Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued an authoritative pronouncement related to testing goodwill for impairment. The guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is &#147;more likely than not&#148;
	that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company adopted this pronouncement since 2012. If it is more likely
	than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Group completes a two-step goodwill impairment test in December of each year. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
	amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the
	second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of
	the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of
	goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying
	value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group has granted share-based compensation awards to certain employees under several equity plans. The Group measures the cost of employee services
	received in exchange for an equity award, based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense is recognized net of estimated forfeitures, determined based on historical experience. The Group recognizes
	share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. For performance and market-based awards which also require a service period, the Group uses graded vesting over the longer of the derived service period or when the performance
	condition is considered probable. The Company determines the grant date fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model (the &#147;Black-Scholes Model&#148;) with assumptions made regarding expected term, volatility,
	risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The fair value of the stock options containing a market condition are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For options awarded by private subsidiaries of the Group, the fair value of shares is
	estimated based on the equity value of the subsidiary. The Group evaluates the fair value of the subsidiary by making judgments and assumptions about the projected financial and operating results of the subsidiary. Once the equity value of the
	subsidiary is determined, it is allocated (as applicable) into the various classes of shares and options using the option-pricing method, which is one of the generally accepted valuation methodologies.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The expected term represents the period of time that stock-based awards granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected term of stock-based awards
	granted is determined based on historical data on employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company&#146;s ordinary shares. Risk-free interest rate is based
	on United States (&#147;US&#148;) government bonds issued with maturity terms similar to the expected term of the stock-based awards.

	greater of the vesting period or derived service period. Forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture patterns and adjusted to reflect future changes in circumstances and facts, if any. If actual forfeitures differ from those
	estimates, the estimates may need to be revised in subsequent periods. The Group uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.

	on fair value. The carrying value of long-term accounts payable approximates its fair value as the impact to discount the long-term payable with interest rate is insignificant. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates its fair value as its
	interest rates is at the same level of the current market yield for comparable loans. The carrying value of convertible notes as of December 31, 2015 was RMB129.3 million (US$20.0 millions) and the fair value of the convertible notes was

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update on revenue recognition that will be applied to all contracts
	with customers. The update requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. It also requires more detailed disclosures
	to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, deferring the effective date for ASU
	2014-09 by one year, and thus, the new standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting
	periods within that reporting period. The guidance allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company&#146;s financial
	condition and results of operations.

	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 to respond to stakeholders &#145;concerns about the current
	accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities. Stakeholders expressed concerns that current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) might require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal entity in situations in which the
	reporting entity&#146;s contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entity&#146;s voting rights, or the reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of
	the legal entity&#146;s economic benefits or obligations. Financial statement users asserted that in certain of those situations in which consolidation is ultimately required, deconsolidated financial statements are necessary to better analyze the
	reporting entity&#146;s economic and operational results. Previously, the FASB issued an indefinite deferral for certain entities to partially address those concerns. However, the amendments in this Update rescind that deferral and address those
	concerns by making changes to the consolidation guidance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact of
	the standard on its consolidated financial statements.

	guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Group early adopted this guidance as of

	with the investee at net asset value on the measurement date, never redeemable with the investee at net asset value, or redeemable with the investee at net asset value at a future date. For investments that are redeemable with the investee at a

	In determining the Group has &#147;the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact
	the VIEs&#146; economic performance,&#148; the Group looked to the specific provisions of the Call Option Agreement and Shareholder Voting Proxy Agreement. These agreements, as summarized above, provide the WOFE effective control over all of the
	corporate and operating decisions of the VIEs, and as such, the Group&#146;s management concluded that the WOFE has the requisite power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs&#146; economic performance. In
	assessing the Group&#146;s obligation to absorb losses, the Group notes that it has funded through the loan agreements all of the entities&#146; share capital and also provides financial support as necessary to the entities through intercompany
	transactions. The Group&#146;s rights to receive economic benefits that are significant to the VIEs are embodied firstly in the Equity Pledge Agreements that secure the equity owners&#146; obligations under the relevant agreements, and ascribes to
	the WOFE all of the economic benefits of the equity interests including rights to any dividends declared.&nbsp;Secondly, the Exclusive Technical Service Agreement further secures the ability of WOFE to receive substantially all of the economic
	benefits from each of the VIEs on behalf of the Group.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In conclusion, because the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary The9 Computer, has (1) the
	power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly affect the VIE&#146;s economic performance and (2) the right to receive benefits from the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs, it has been deemed to be the primary
	beneficiary of the VIEs and has consolidated the respective VIEs since the date of execution of such agreements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Shareholders of the VIEs may potentially
	have conflicts of interest with the Company, and they may breach their contracts with the PRC subsidiaries or cause such contracts to be amended in a manner contrary to the interests of the Company. As a result, the Company may have to initiate
	legal proceedings, which involve significant uncertainty. Such disputes and proceedings may significantly disrupt the Company&#146;s business operations and adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to control the VIEs. In light of the fact that
	most of the shareholders of the VIEs are directors, officers, shareholders or employees of the Company or the PRC subsidiaries, management is of the view that the risk that misaligned interests may lead to deconsolidation in the foreseeable future
	is remote and insignificant.

	PRC laws and regulations currently limit foreign ownership of companies that provide Internet content services,
	which include operating online games. In addition, foreign invested enterprises are currently not eligible to apply for the required licenses for operating online games in the PRC. The Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and is considered
	a foreign entity under the PRC laws. Due to restrictions on foreign ownership of the provision of online games, the Company is dependent on the licenses held by Shanghai IT to conduct its online games business through its subsidiary in the PRC.
	Shanghai IT holds the necessary licenses and approvals that are essential for the online game business. The9 Computer has entered into contractual arrangements with Shanghai IT for use of its relevant licenses and websites. Shanghai IT is
	principally owned by certain shareholder and employee of the Company. Pursuant to certain other agreements and undertakings, the Company in substance controls Shanghai IT. In the opinion of the Company&#146;s directors, the Company&#146;s current
	ownership structures and its contractual arrangements with Shanghai IT, and its equity owners as well as its operations, are in compliance with all existing PRC laws and regulations. However, there may be changes and other developments in the PRC
	laws and regulations or their interpretation. Specifically following the recent promulgation of the GAPP Circular, it is unclear whether the authorities will deem our VIE structure and contractual arrangements with Shanghai IT as an &#147;indirect
	or disguised&#148; way by foreign investors to gain control over or participate in domestic online game operators, and challenge our VIE structure accordingly. If the Company, its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs are found to be in violation of any
	existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including requiring the Company
	to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring such as forcing the Company to transfer its equity interest in the PRC subsidiaries to a domestic entity or invalidating the VIE agreements. If the PRC government authorities impose penalties which
	cause the Company to lose its rights to direct the activities of and receive economic benefits from the VIEs, the Company may lose the ability to consolidate and reflect in its financial statements the financial condition, and results of operation
	of the VIEs.

	Due to a weaker than expected operating performance of certain games, and the expectation that the net cash flow of these games will not be

	respectively, and an impairment loss for deferred cost of RMB2.7 million, nil and nil for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. The impairment charges of prepaid royalties and deferred cost were included in cost of

	In 2010, the Group recognized goodwill of RMB10.9 million in connection with the acquisition of Red 5. The Group measures the
	consideration it transfers at fair value, which may be calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred to former owners of the acquiree, and equity instruments issued. The costs directly
	attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interests.
	Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and recorded as a liability. The excess of (i) the total cost of acquisition, fair value of the noncontrolling interests and acquisition-date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the
	acquiree over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference would be recognized
	directly in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

	Since its acquisition by the Group on April 6, 2010, Red 5 has been substantially devoting its operating activities
	to fulfill its obligations under a game development and license agreement executed in 2006 and amended in 2009 between Red 5 and a third party game publisher to develop Firefall in exchange for cash consideration from the third party publisher.
	Prior to the acquisition, Red 5 received a total of US$24.7 million cash consideration as an advance recoupable against future royalties payable to Red 5. Red 5 retained the ownership of the game and granted the third party publisher an exclusive,
	non-transferable term license to market and distributes the game and host the game to customers in specified regions after Red 5 completes the game development. Red 5 continues to perform its obligations under the agreement post-acquisition,
	including the provision of post-contract customer support for the hosted version of the game to the third party publisher during the term of the license. The initial term of the agreement is from February 2006 through the fifth anniversary of the
	first commercial release of the initial game. Thereafter, the agreement can be renewed in two-year terms.

	non-transferable term license to market and distribute the game and host the game to customers in specified regions. Under the agreements, the Group paid US$10.0 million and guaranteed an additional payment of US$12.7 million to the third party game
	publisher due within four years. In addition, the Group is subject to additional contingent payments to be calculated based on certain percentages of the proceeds received from future game licensing and royalties, if any. The total consideration
	paid, including the US$10 million and the guaranteed amount of US$12.7 million, was recorded as acquired game license and the contingent payments will be recorded as cost of services when incurred. The amount payable which is expected to due on or

	The Group prepaid RMB20.0 million to a supplier for purchasing computers and equipment in 2011. Due to
	game&#146;s performance being much lower than expectations, the Group cancelled the purchase plan and requested for a refund on the prepayment from the supplier in 2013. However, the supplier did not have enough funds to return all prepayment which
	was deemed a strong indicator that recovery of the refund is doubtful. In February 2014, the Group agreed a repayment schedule with the supplier, under which the prepayment is required to be refunded in four installments during the next three years,
	and the first installment, which was RMB2.0 million, had been received on March, 2014. Due to the significant doubts as to the collectability of the remaining amount, management provided an allowance for the remaining prepayment receivable of
	RMB17.9 million as of December 31, 2013.&nbsp;The Company continued to negotiate with the supplier for the settlement of remaining receivables.&nbsp;In December 2014, the supplier promised to repay all the remaining RMB17.9 million before March 31,
	2015. The Group revaluated the collectability of the receivables and determined the payments can be collected and therefore reversed the allowance of RMB17.9 million as of December 31, 2014. In March, 2015, the Group received payment of RMB17.9
	million from the supplier.

	renewed its HNTE qualification and obtained approval in 2015, which entitles Shanghai IT to enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 15% during the period from 2014 to 2016. Total tax savings of Shanghai IT were nil for the years ended December 31, 2013,

	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, a reversal of valuation allowance and an increase of valuation allowance of
	approximately RMB21.0 million and RMB17.8 million (US$2.7 million) was provided respectively. The Group considers positive and negative evidence to determine whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be
	realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, the Group&#146;s experience with tax attributes
	expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. Valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets based on a more-likely-than-not threshold. The Group&#146;s ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on its ability to generate
	sufficient taxable income within the carry forward periods provided for in the tax law.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December 31, 2015, the Group&#146;s PRC subsidiaries had
	net operating loss carry forwards of RMB817.1 million, of which RMB162.9 million, RMB327.9 million, RMB190.2 million, RMB46.3 million and RMB89.8 million will expire in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The Group has provided a full
	valuation allowance as it is not more likely than not that the net operating losses can be utilized before expiry.

	As of December 31, 2015, Red 5 had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of
	approximately US$124.2 million and US$68.7 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2026 and 2016, respectively. Red 5 also had credits for increasing research activities available to offset future federal and state taxes payable of
	approximately US$0.1 million and US$0.1 million, respectively, that will begin to expire in 2026 for federal purposes and which have no expiration for state purposes. Red 5 had foreign tax credits for federal purposes of approximately US$2.5
	million, which begin to expire in 2016. Pursuant to US tax laws and regulations, the utilization of an acquired entity&#146;s net operation losses and credits are subject to annual limitation computed based on the fair value of the acquired entity.
	As a result of the limitation, the Group provided a full valuation allowance as it is not more likely than not that the net operating losses and credits carried forward can be utilized before expiration.

	In accordance with the Enterprise Income Tax Law (&#147;EIT Law&#148;), dividends, which arise from profits of foreign invested enterprises (&#147;FIEs&#148;)
	earned after January 1, 2008, are subject to a 10% withholding income tax. In addition, under tax treaty between the PRC and Hong Kong, if the foreign investor is incorporated in Hong Kong and qualifies as the beneficial owner, the applicable
	withholding tax rate is reduced to 5%, if the investor holds at least 25% in the FIE, or 10%, if the investor holds less than 25% in the FIE. A deferred tax liability should be recognized for the undistributed profits of PRC companies unless the
	Company has sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the undistributed dividends will be reinvested and the remittance of the dividends will be postponed indefinitely. The Group plans to indefinitely reinvest undistributed profits earned after
	December 31, 2007 from its China subsidiaries in its operations in the PRC. Therefore, no withholding income taxes for undistributed profits of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries have been provided as of December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under applicable accounting principles, a deferred tax liability should be recorded for taxable temporary differences attributable to the excess of financial
	reporting basis over tax basis in a domestic subsidiary. However, recognition is not required in situations where the tax law provides a means by which the reported amount of that investment can be recovered tax-free and the enterprise expects that
	it will ultimately use that means. The Group has not recorded any such deferred tax liability attributable to the undistributed earnings of its financial interests in VIEs because these entities do not have any accumulated earnings as of December
	31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group made its assessment of the level of authority for each tax position (including the potential application of interests
	and penalties) based on the tax positions&#146; technical merits, and measured the unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions. The Group did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The Group does
	not anticipate that unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Group did not have any material interest and penalties associated with its
	tax positions.

	According to PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations is three years if the
	underpayment of taxes is due to computational errors made by the taxpayer or withholding agent. The statute of limitations will be extended five years under special circumstances, which are not clearly defined (but an underpayment of tax liability
	exceeding RMB 0.1 million is specifically listed as a special circumstance). In the case of a related party transaction, the statute of limitations is ten years. There is no statute of limitations in the case of tax evasion. From inception to 2015,
	the Group is subject to examination of the PRC tax authorities. Red 5&#146;s federal income tax returns and state income tax returns for 2006 through 2015 are open tax years, subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities.

	As a result of the loss of the WoW license on June 7, 2009, the Group announced a refund plan in connection with inactivated WoW game point
	cards, which the Group recorded as advance from customers. According to the plan, inactivated WoW game point card holders are eligible to receive a cash refund from the Group. The Group recorded a liability in connection with both inactivated points
	cards and activated but unconsumed point cards of approximately RMB200.4 million, of which RMB4.0 million was refunded in 2009.

	Upon the loss of the WoW license, the Group concluded the nature of the obligation substantively changed from
	deferred revenue, for which the Group had the ability to satisfy the underlying performance obligation, to an obligation to refund players for their unconsumed points. The Group has accounted for this refund liability by applying the derecognition
	guidance specified in ASC 405-20.&nbsp;In accordance with this guidance, the refund liability associated with these WoW game points, to the extent not refunded, will be recorded as other operating income after the Group is legally released from the
	obligation to refund amounts under the applicable laws. In consultation with its legal counsel, the Group concluded the legal liability relating to the inactivated WoW game point cards was extinguished in September 2011 on the basis that the legal
	liability lapsed two years from the date the Group publicly announced the refund policy that applied to these cards. Accordingly, the associated liability amounting to RMB26.0 million (US$4.2 million) was recognized as other operating income for the
	year ended December 31, 2011. With respect to the remaining refund liability, based on current PRC laws, to the extent not refunded, the Company, in consultation with legal counsel has determined that it will be legally released from this liability
	in September 2029, which represents 20 years from the discontinuation of WoW in 2009.&nbsp;However, if the Group were to publicly announce a refund policy, the Group would be legally released from any remaining liability for these activated, but
	unconsumed points that remained two years from the date of such announcement. To date, the Group has determined not to publicly announce any refund policy with respect to this remaining liability, and no refunds have been claimed. The remaining
	refund liability relating to the activated, but unconsumed WoW game points is RMB170.0 million (US$26.2 million) as of December 31, 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2009, the
	Group engaged an agent to facilitate the refund to game players and provided an advance payment to the agent for RMB43.3 million for this purpose. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, nil were refunded to game point card holders through the agent, respectively.
	In February 2012, the Group entered into an agreement with the agent pursuant to which the agent will refund the advance to the Group in installments over a five year period after deducting any further refunds paid to game point card holders. As of
	December 31, 2015, the balance of the advance payment to the agent was RMB8.4 million (US$1.3 million). As of December 31, 2015, the Group wrote off the remaining RMB8.4 million receivable because it is unlikely that the agent will refund to us
	since the business relationship between the Group and the agent have been terminated.

	On January 8, 2009, the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan. The shareholder rights plan is designed to protect the best interests of

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to the terms of the shareholder rights plan, as amended, one right was distributed with respect to each ordinary share of the Company outstanding at
	the close of business on January 22, 2009. The rights will become exercisable only if a person or group (the &#147;Acquiring Person&#148;) obtains ownership of 15% or more of the Company&#146;s voting securities (including by acquisition of the
	Company&#146;s ADSs representing ordinary shares) (a &#147;Triggering Event&#148;), subject to certain exceptions. In the case of a Triggering Event, the rights plan entitles shareholders other than the Acquiring Person to purchase, for an exercise
	price of US$19.50, a number of shares with a value twice that of the exercise price. The number of shares each such shareholder will be entitled to purchase is equal to the product of (i) the number of shares then owned by such shareholder and (ii)
	two times the exercise price divided by the then current market price per share. The rights plan will continue in effect until January 8, 2019, unless the plan is terminated by the Company or the rights are redeemed by the Company before the plan
	expires. The plan has not been exercisable yet.

	Incsight is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and wholly owned by Mr. Jun Zhu. On December 8, 2010, as approved by the Board of Directors,
	the Company granted 1,500,000 ordinary shares to Incsight, subject to performance conditions, of which 500,000 shares granted will vest when the Group achieves breakeven and 1,000,000 shares will vest when the Group&#146;s cumulative profit reaches
	US$5 million in a quarter subsequent to the quarter in which the Group breaks even. The ordinary shares granted are not entitled to receive dividends until vested. The Board considered the grant of ordinary shares as an incentive to retain Mr.
	Zhu&#146;s services with the Group. The awarded non-vested shares would be valid for five years from December 8, 2010. For the quarter ended September 30, 2014, the Group achieved breakeven. It is considered probable the performance targets will be
	met for the total of 1,500,000 ordinary shares. The fair value of the granted non-vested shares was US$6.48 per share, the market price on the date of grant. On December 7, 2015, 500,000 shares granted to Incsight Limited were vested. The awarded
	non-vested shares would be valid for additional three years and expired on December 7, 2018. The Group recorded share-based compensation of RMB7.6 million, RMB2.2 million and RMB1.2million (US$0.2 million) for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014

	Pursuant to laws applicable to entities incorporated in the PRC, the subsidiaries and the VIEs of the Group in the PRC must make
	appropriations from after-tax profit to non-distributable reserve funds. These reserve funds include one or more of the following: (i) a general reserve, (ii) an enterprise expansion fund and (iii) a staff bonus and welfare fund. Subject to certain
	cumulative limits, the general reserve fund requires annual appropriation of 10% of after tax profit (as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the PRC at each year-end) until the accumulative amount of such reserve fund
	reaches 50% of their registered capital; the other fund appropriations are at the subsidiaries&#146; discretion. These reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes of enterprise expansion and staff bonus and welfare are not distributable as
	cash dividends. The appropriation to these reserves by the Group&#146;s PRC entities were nil, nil and nil for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The accumulated reserves as of December 31, 2015 is RMB 3.8 million. In addition,
	due to restrictions on the distribution of registered capital from the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries, the PRC subsidiaries&#146; registered capital of 19.5 million as of December 31, 2015, were considered restricted. As a result of these PRC laws
	and regulations, as of December 31, 2015, approximately RMB23.3 million (US$3.6 million), were not available for distribution to the Company by its PRC subsidiaries in the form of dividends, loans or advances.

	In August 2014, Red 5 issued 27,438,952 Series B redeemable convertible preferred shares of Red 5 to a new investor (see Note 31). As the license to publish Firefall belongs to Red 5 Singapore (Note 11), as a condition
	for the investment by the new investor, the Group is required to transfer the license to Red 5. As such, in June 2014, the Group transferred its equity interests in Red 5 Singapore, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group to Red 5, a 79.2% owned
	subsidiary at a nominal price. At the time of transfer, 20.8% of the accumulated deficit of Red 5 Singapore, amounted to RMB 15,068,103, was attributable to the noncontrolling interest of Red 5 with no consideration, which was recorded as an equity

	As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company was
	incorporated in December, 1999 in the Cayman Islands to be the holding company of the Group principally engaged in the development and operation of online games and internet related businesses, including massively multiplayer online games
	(&#147;MMOGs&#148;), mobile games and TV games.

	The condensed financial information has been prepared using the same accounting policies as set
	out in the consolidated financial statements except that the equity method has been used to account for investments in its subsidiaries and VIE. For the parent company, the Company records its investments in subsidiaries and VIE under the equity
	method of accounting as prescribed in
<I>
	&nbsp;
</I>
<I>
	ASC 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures
</I>
	. Such investments are presented on the Condensed Balance Sheets as &#147;Investment in subsidiaries and VIE&#148; and the subsidiaries
	and VIE&#146; profit or loss as &#147;Equity in income/loss of subsidiaries&#148; on the Condensed Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Ordinarily under the equity, an investor in an equity method investee would cease to recognize its share of the
	losses of an investee once the carrying value of the investment has been reduced to nil absent an undertaking by the investor to provide continuing support and fund losses. For the purpose of this Schedule I, the parent company has continued to
	reflect its share, based on its proportionate interest, of the losses of subsidiaries and VIE regardless of the carrying value of the investment even though the parent company is not obligated to provide continuing support or fund losses.

	non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek a preservation order, an injunction, specific performance and other equitable or interim relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the breaching party and to enforce specifically the terms and
	provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The breaching party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to the
	non-breaching party on the basis that (a) the non-breaching party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. In seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
	breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. The remedies
	available to the Investor pursuant to this
<U>
	Section 12.3
</U>
	shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or

<U>
	Mechanics of Exercise
</U>
	.&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, this Warrant may be exercised by the
	Holder on any day on or after the Issuance Date, in whole or in part, by delivery of a written notice, in the form attached hereto as&nbsp;
<U>
	Exhibit&nbsp;A
</U>
	&nbsp;(the &#147;
<B>
	Exercise Notice
</B>
	&#148;), of the Holder&#146;s election to exercise
	this Warrant.&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant ADSs available hereunder such that the
	Outstanding Principal Amount has been reduced to zero and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three (3) Trading Days of the date the final Exercise
	Notice is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant shall have the effect of lowering the Outstanding Principal Amount in an amount equal to the product of the number of Warrant ADSs purchased as part of the partial exercise and
	the then applicable Exercise Price (as defined below).&nbsp;The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the date of such purchases of Warrant ADSs and the Outstanding Principal Amount.&nbsp;
<B>
	The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance
	of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant ADSs hereunder, the Outstanding Principal Amount at any given time may be less than the Outstanding
	Principal Amount stated on the face hereof.
</B>
	&nbsp;On or before the third (3rd) Business Day following the date on which the Company has received the Exercise Notice and representation letters and other documents reasonably requested by the
	Depositary, the Company shall transmit by facsimile an acknowledgment of confirmation of receipt of the Exercise Notice to the Holder and The Bank of New York Mellon (the &#147;
<B>
	Depositary
</B>
	&#148;) for the ADSs.&nbsp;On or before the fifth (5th)
	Business Day following the date on which the Company has received the Exercise Notice and representation letters and other documents reasonably requested by the Depositary (the &#147;
<B>
	ADS Delivery Date
</B>
	&#148;), the Company shall (A) issue and
	deposit with the Depositary a number of Ordinary Shares that will be represented by the number of Warrant ADSs to which the Holder is entitled in respect of that exercise, (B) pay the fee of the Depositary for the issuance of that number of ADSs and
	(C) instruct the Depositary to promptly execute and deliver to that Holder the Warrant ADSs subject to the applicable securities laws and regulations.&nbsp;No fractional ADSs are to be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant.&nbsp;If any fractional
	share of an ADS would, except for the provisions of the prior sentence, be deliverable upon such exercise, the Company, in lieu of delivering such fractional share, shall pay to the exercising Holder an amount in cash equal to the Closing Sale Price
	on the Principal Market of such fractional ADS on the date of exercise.&nbsp;The Company shall pay any and all taxes which may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Warrant ADSs upon exercise of this Warrant.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the case of Warrant ADSs issued with any restrictive legends, upon the Company&#146;s receipt of notice and representation letters and other documents
	reasonably requested by the Depositary from the Holder that (a) Warrant ADSs containing any restrictive legends have been resold in reliance on an effective resale registration statement relating to the resale of ADSs representing Warrant ADSs or
	pursuant to Rule 144, or (b) Warrant ADSs containing any restrictive legends that are beneficially owned by it have become freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public
	information required under Rule 144 as to such Warrant ADSs and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions, accompanied by a certificate or certificates evidencing the Warrant ADSs, if any, that have been sold pursuant to clause (a) above or for
	which the legend is to be removed pursuant to clause (b) above, the Company shall within eleven (11) Business Days cause to be issued and delivered for deposit to the Depositary irrevocable instructions that the Depositary deliver ADSs without any
	restrictive legend with respect to such Warrant ADSs to or upon the directions of the Holder and such other documents as the Depositary may reasonably require from the Company in connection therewith. From and after the date the Company receives the
	notice specified in clause (b) above, Warrant ADSs which are subsequently issued upon exercise of this Warrant shall not bear a restrictive legend, provided that the conditions specified in clause (b) above are still satisfied at such time. If the
	Company fails to cause the Depositary to deliver ADSs representing Warrant ADSs pursuant to the terms of this Warrant, then the Company shall fully indemnify the Holder for any liabilities, judgments, costs, losses, fines and expenses of any kind
	the Holder incurs in connection with such failure. Any fees, including fees of the Depositary, associated with the removal of restrictive legends from any Warrant ADSs and the deposit of Warrant ADSs to the Depositary for the issuance of ADSs shall
	be borne by the Company.

	Mechanics of Exercise
</U>
	.&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, this Warrant may be exercised by the Holder on any day
	on or after the Issuance Date, in whole or in part, by delivery of a written notice, in the form attached hereto as&nbsp;
<U>
	Exhibit A
</U>
	&nbsp;(the &#147;
<B>
	Exercise Notice
</B>
	&#148;), of the Holder&#146;s election to exercise this
	Warrant.&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant ADSs available hereunder such that the Outstanding
	Principal Amount has been reduced to zero and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three (3) Trading Days of the date the final Exercise Notice is
	delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant shall have the effect of lowering the Outstanding Principal Amount in an amount equal to the product of the number of Warrant ADSs purchased as part of the partial exercise and the then
	applicable Exercise Price (as defined below).&nbsp;The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the date of such purchases of Warrant ADSs and the Outstanding Principal Amount.&nbsp;
<B>
	The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this
	Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant ADSs hereunder, the Outstanding Principal Amount at any given time may be less than the Outstanding Principal
	Amount stated on the face hereof.
</B>
	&nbsp;On or before the third (3rd) Business Day following the date on which the Company has received the Exercise Notice and representation letters and other documents reasonably requested by the Depositary, the
	Company shall transmit by facsimile an acknowledgment of confirmation of receipt of the Exercise Notice to the Holder and The Bank of New York Mellon (the &#147;
<B>
	Depositary
</B>
	&#148;) for the ADSs.&nbsp;On or before the fifth (5th) Business Day
	following the date on which the Company has received the Exercise Notice (the &#147;
<B>
	ADS Delivery Date
</B>
	&#148;), the Company shall (A) issue and deposit with the Depositary a number of Ordinary Shares that will be represented by the number of
	Warrant ADSs to which the Holder is entitled in respect of that exercise, (B) pay the fee of the Depositary for the issuance of that number of ADSs and (C) instruct the Depositary to promptly execute and deliver to that Holder the Warrant ADSs
	subject to the applicable securities laws and regulations.&nbsp;No fractional ADSs are to be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant.&nbsp;If any fractional share of an ADS would, except for the provisions of the prior sentence, be deliverable upon
	such exercise, the Company, in lieu of delivering such fractional share, shall pay to the exercising Holder an amount in cash equal to the Closing Sale Price on the Principal Market of such fractional ADS on the date of exercise.&nbsp;The Company
	shall pay any and all taxes which may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Warrant ADSs upon exercise of this Warrant.

	Warrant ADSs issued with any restrictive legends, upon the Company&#146;s receipt of notice and representation letters and other documents reasonably requested by the Depositary from the Holder that (a) Warrant ADSs containing any restrictive
	legends have been resold in reliance on an effective resale registration statement relating to the resale of ADSs representing Warrant ADSs or pursuant to Rule 144, or (b) Warrant ADSs containing any restrictive legends that are beneficially owned
	by it have become freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144 as to such Warrant ADSs and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions,
	accompanied by a certificate or certificates evidencing the Warrant ADSs, if any, that have been sold pursuant to clause (a) above or for which the legend is to be removed pursuant to clause (b) above, the Company shall within eleven (11) Business
	Days cause to be issued and delivered for deposit to the Depositary irrevocable instructions that the Depositary deliver ADSs without any restrictive legend with respect to such Warrant ADSs to or upon the directions of the Holder and such other
	documents as the Depositary may reasonably require from the Company in connection therewith. From and after the date the Company receives the notice specified in clause (b) above, Warrant ADSs which are subsequently issued upon exercise of this
	Warrant shall not bear a restrictive legend, provided that the conditions specified in clause (b) above are still satisfied at such time. If the Company fails to cause the Depositary to deliver ADSs representing Warrant ADSs pursuant to the terms of
	this Warrant, then the Company shall fully indemnify the Holder for any liabilities, judgments, costs, losses, fines and expenses of any kind the Holder incurs in connection with such failure. Any fees, including fees of the Depositary, associated
	with the removal of restrictive legends from any Warrant ADSs and the deposit of Warrant ADSs to the Depositary for the issuance of ADSs shall be borne by the Company.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our
	responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An audit involves
	performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor&#146;s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
	financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company&#146;s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit
	procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the
	appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
	obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

	Our audit also comprehended the translation of Renminbi amounts into United States dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made in
	conformity with the basis stated in Note 3.&nbsp;Such United States dollar amounts are presented solely for the convenience of readers in the United States of America.

	control the VIE through its rights to all the residual benefits of the VIE and its obligation to fund losses of the VIE then the entity is consolidated. All intercompany balances and transactions between the Company, its subsidiaries and VIE have

	PRC laws and regulations currently prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of internet-related business. In
	September&nbsp;2009, the General Administration of Press and Publication (&#147;GAPP&#148;)&nbsp;further promulgated the Circular Regarding the Implementation of the Department Reorganization Regulation by State Council and Relevant Interpretation
	by State Commission Office for Public Sector Reform and the Further Strengthening of the Administration of Pre-approval on Online Games and Approval on Import Online Games, or the GAPP Circular. It is not clear that the regulatory authority of the
	GAPP applies to the regulation of ownership structures of online game companies based in the PRC. While the GAPP Circular is applicable to the Group and its business in terms of publication and pre-approval of online games, to date, GAPP has not
	issued any interpretation of Section 4 of the GAPP Circular to specifically invalidate VIE agreements and, to the Group&#146;s knowledge, has not taken any enforcement action under Section 4 of the GAPP Circular against any of the companies that
	rely on contractual arrangements with VIE to operate online games in the PRC. Therefore, the Group believes that its ability to direct the activities of VIE that most significantly impact their economic performance is not affected by the GAPP
	Circular.

	The Group evaluates its long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For in-game premium features that are immediately consumed, revenue is recognized upon

	predetermined expiration, revenue is recognized ratably over the estimated average lives of the perpetual features, which are typically less than one year.&nbsp;When estimating the average lives of the in-game perpetual features, the Group considers
	the average period that players typically play the game, other player behavior patterns, and factors including the acceptance and popularity of expansion packs, promotional events launched, and market conditions. Future usage patterns of players may

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May 2014,
	the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update (&#147;ASU&#148;) on revenue recognition that will be applied to all contracts with customers. The update requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers
	promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and
	uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance will be required to be applied on a retrospective basis, using one of two methodologies, and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2018, with early application permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have
	on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 to respond to stakeholders
	&#145;concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities. Stakeholders expressed concerns that current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) might require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal
	entity in situations in which the reporting entity&#146;s contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entity&#146;s voting rights, or the reporting
	entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entity&#146;s economic benefits or obligations. Financial statement users asserted that in certain of those situations in which consolidation is ultimately required, deconsolidated financial
	statements are necessary to better analyze the reporting entity&#146;s economic and operational results. Previously, the FASB issued an indefinite deferral for certain entities to partially address those concerns. However, the amendments in this
	Update rescind that deferral and address those concerns by making changes to the consolidation guidance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Group
	is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.

	In determining the Group has &#147;the power to
	direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#146; economic performance,&#148; the Group looked to the specific provisions of the Call Option Agreement and Shareholder Voting Proxy Agreement. These agreements, as
	summarized above, provide the WOFE effective control over all of the corporate and operating decisions of the VIE, and as such, the Group&#146;s management concluded that the WOFE has the requisite power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
	significantly impact the VIE&#146; economic performance. In assessing the Group&#146;s obligation to absorb losses, the Group notes that it has funded through the loan agreements all of the entities&#146; share capital and also provides financial
	support as necessary to the entities through intercompany transactions. The Group&#146;s rights to receive economic benefits that are significant to the VIE are embodied firstly in the Equity Pledge Agreements that secure the equity owners&#146;
	obligations under the relevant agreements, and ascribes to the WOFE all of the economic benefits of the equity interests including rights to any dividends declared. Secondly, the Exclusive Technical Service Agreement further secures the ability of
	WOFE to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from each of the VIE on behalf of the Group.

	In conclusion, because the Group, through its
	wholly owned subsidiary Jiuhuo Qitian, has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE&#146;s economic performance and (2) the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant
	to the VIE, it has been deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and has consolidated the respective VIE since the date of execution of such agreements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Shareholders of the VIE may potentially have conflicts of interest with the Company, and they may breach their contracts with the PRC subsidiaries or cause
	such contracts to be amended in a manner contrary to the interests of the Company. As a result, the Company may have to initiate legal proceedings, which involve significant uncertainty. Such disputes and proceedings may significantly disrupt the
	Company&#146;s business operations and adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to control the VIE. In light of the fact that most of the shareholders of the VIE are directors, officers, shareholders or employees of the Company or the PRC
	subsidiaries, management is of the view that the risk that misaligned interests may lead to deconsolidation in the foreseeable future is remote and insignificant.

	PRC laws and regulations currently limit foreign ownership of companies that provide Internet content services, which include operating online games. In
	addition, foreign invested enterprises are currently not eligible to apply for the required licenses for operating online games in the PRC. The Company is incorporated in Hong Kong and is considered a foreign entity under the PRC laws. Due to
	restrictions on foreign ownership of the provision of online games, the Company is dependent on the licenses held by Shanghai Ao Zhi to conduct its online games business through its subsidiary in the PRC. Shanghai Ao Zhi holds the necessary licenses
	and approvals that are essential for the online game business. Jiuhuo Qitiani has entered into contractual arrangements with Shanghai Ao Zhi for use of its relevant licenses and websites. Shanghai Ao Zhi is principally owned by certain employees of
	the Group&#146;s shareholder. Pursuant to certain other agreements and undertakings, the Company in substance controls Shanghai Ao Zhi. In the opinion of the Company&#146;s directors, the Company&#146;s current ownership structures and its
	contractual arrangements with Shanghai Ao Zhi, and its equity owners as well as its operations, are in compliance with all existing PRC laws and regulations. However, there may be changes and other developments in the PRC laws and regulations or
	their interpretation. Specifically following the recent promulgation of the GAPP Circular, it is unclear whether the authorities will deem our VIE structure and contractual arrangements with Shanghai Ao Zhi as an &#147;indirect or disguised&#148;
	way by foreign investors to gain control over or participate in domestic online game operators, and challenge our VIE structure accordingly. If the Company, its PRC subsidiary and VIE are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws
	or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including requiring the Company to undergo a costly and
	disruptive restructuring such as forcing the Company to transfer its equity interest in the PRC subsidiaries to a domestic entity or invalidating the VIE agreements. If the PRC government authorities impose penalties which cause the Company to lose
	its rights to direct the activities of and receive economic benefits from the VIE, the Company may lose the ability to consolidate and reflect in its financial statements the financial condition, and results of operation of the VIE.

	of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including requiring the Company to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring such as forcing the Company
	to transfer its equity interest in the PRC subsidiaries to a domestic entity or invalidating the VIE agreements. If the PRC government authorities impose penalties which cause the Company to lose its rights to direct the activities of and receive
	economic benefits from the VIE, the Company may lose the ability to consolidate and reflect in its financial statements the results of operation of the VIE. The Company, however, does not believe such actions would result in the liquidation or
	dissolution of the Company, the WFOE or VIE.

	The Group considers positive and negative evidence to determine whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
	more likely than not realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, the Group&#146;s experience with
	tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. These assumptions require significant judgment and the forecasts of future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates the Group is using to manage the underlying
	businesses. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not threshold. The Group&#146;s ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on its ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carry
	forward periods provided for in the tax law. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Group&#146;s PRC subsidiaries had net operating loss carry forwards of RMB16million. The loss carrying forward will begin to expire in 2021. No valuation allowance was recorded for the period from May 26, 2014 (date of
	establishment) to December 31, 2014 (unaudited) and year ended December 31, 2015 as it is determined that it is more likely than not that the relevant deferred tax asset will be realized.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As mentioned in Note 2 above, the Group early adopted ASU 2015-17 to present the deferred tax assets on the non-current balance of nil and RMB 6.9 million
	(US$1.1 million) as of December 31, 2014 (Unaudited)&nbsp;and 2015, respectively.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In accordance with the Enterprise Income Tax Law (&#147;EIT Law&#148;),
	dividends, which arise from profits of foreign invested enterprises (&#147;FIEs&#148;) earned after January 1, 2008, are subject to a 10% withholding income tax. In addition, under tax treaty between the PRC and Hong Kong, if the foreign investor is
	incorporated in Hong Kong and qualifies as the beneficial owner, the applicable withholding tax rate is reduced to 5%, if the investor holds at least 25% in the FIE, or 10%, if the investor holds less than 25% in the FIE. A deferred tax liability
	should be recognized for the undistributed profits of PRC companies unless the Company has sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the undistributed dividends will be reinvested and the remittance of the dividends will be postponed indefinitely. The
	Group plans to indefinitely reinvest undistributed profits earned after December 31, 2007 from its China subsidiaries in its operations in the PRC. Therefore, no withholding income taxes for undistributed profits of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries
	have been provided as of December 31, 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group made its assessment of the level of authority for each tax position (including the potential
	application of interests and penalties) based on the tax positions&#146; technical merits, and measured the unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions. The Group did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015. The
	Group does not anticipate that unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. For the years ended December 31, 2015, the Group did not have any material interest and penalties associated with its tax
	positions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	According to PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to
	computational errors made by the taxpayer or withholding agent. The statute of limitations will be extended five years under special circumstances, which are not clearly defined (but an underpayment of tax liability exceeding RMB 0.1 million is
	specifically listed as a special circumstance). In the case of a related party transaction, the statute of limitations is ten years. There is no statute of limitations in the case of tax evasion. From inception to 2015, the Group is subject to
	examination of the PRC tax authorities.
