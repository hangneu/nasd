	of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,850,000. Of the Private Placement Units, 265,000 were purchased

	At the June
	Meeting, shareholders holding 1,054,401 public shares exercised their right to convert such public shares into a pro rata

	was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. In connection with the Initial Extension, our Current Management
	provided a loan to us of $0.20 for each public share that was not converted, for an aggregate amount of approximately
	$629,000, which was deposited this in the trust account. In addition to the contribution, the Current Management
	(the &ldquo;Lender&rdquo;) loaned to us an additional amount of approximately $371,000 for our working capital needs, for
	an aggregate amount of $1,000,000. The loan was evidenced by a promissory note (the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;) and was
	unsecured, non-interest bearing and is payable at our consummation of a business combination. As issued, the Note did not
	bear interest, and up to $175,000 of the principal amount of the Note is convertible at the option of the Lender into 17,500
	private placement units (consisting of one ordinary share, one right and one warrant for one-half of an ordinary share) at
	$10.00 per unit. The terms of the units are identical to the units issued by us in our initial public offering except that
	the warrants included in such units are non-redeemable by us and will be exercisable for cash or on a &ldquo;cashless&rdquo;
	basis, in each case, if held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees. If the Current Management converts the
	entire $175,000 of the principal balance of the Note, they would receive 17,500 private placement units. If a business
	combination is not consummated, the Note will not be repaid by us and all amounts owed thereunder by us will be forgiven

	We believe our structure
	will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target
	business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation,
	the owners of the target business may exchange their shares in the target business for our shares or for a combination of shares
	and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find
	this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In
	a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that
	will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business
	combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always
	subject to the underwriters&rsquo; ability to complete the offering as well as general market conditions that could prevent the
	offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional
	means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&rsquo; interests than it would have as a privately-held company.
	It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&rsquo;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting
	talented employees.

	We are not presently
	engaged in any substantive commercial business until we complete a business combination, including the Merger. We intend to utilize
	cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of Private Placement Units, our share capital,
	debt or a combination of these, as well as the contributions made by our Current Management in connection with the June Meeting
	and December Meeting, in effecting a business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of the initial public
	offering and the private placement of Private Placement Units are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business
	combination, which may include the Merger, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. A business
	combination (if not Aina Le&rsquo;a pursuant to the Merger) may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does
	not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what
	it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense,
	loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate
	a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we
	may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as
	a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.

	Pursuant to Nasdaq
	listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80%
	of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time
	of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose
	fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. A business combination can be structured where we acquire
	100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination
	where we merge directly with the target business (such as the Merger). We can also structure a business combination where we acquire
	less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management
	team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company
	owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in
	the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
	as amended. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders
	prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations
	ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue
	a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital of a target. In this case, we would acquire a
	100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders
	immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our
	initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned
	or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what
	will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant
	amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private
	offering of debt or equity securities. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon
	one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or
	book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we
	will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders
	valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
	We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly
	renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of
	directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. We did not obtain such an opinion
	in connection with the Merger.

	In connection with
	any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting
	called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for
	or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
	(net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means
	of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate
	amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, as described below, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to
	convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account or
	sell any public shares to us in any tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. If we determine to engage
	in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each public shareholder may tender any or all of his, her or its
	public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder
	approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made
	by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction, whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise
	require us to seek shareholder approval or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer at such time (which would require
	us to conduct a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Unlike other blank check companies which
	require shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions
	of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will
	have the flexibility to avoid such shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and
	Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with
	the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is
	required under the SEC&rsquo;s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets
	of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding ordinary
	shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. For the Merger, we intend to seek shareholder approval of the Merger
	with Aina Le&rsquo;a at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares,
	regardless of whether they vote for or against the Merger, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in
	the trust account (net of taxes payable).

	We chose our net tangible
	asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. The
	$5,000,001 net tangible asset value would be determined once a target business is located and we can assess all of the assets and
	liabilities of the combined company (which would include the fee payable to EBC in an amount equal to 4.0% of the total gross proceeds
	raised in the offering as described elsewhere in this annual report, any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders,
	officers, directors or their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating
	possible business targets and business combinations that have not been repaid at that time, as well as any other liabilities of
	ours and the liabilities of the target business). However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target
	business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available
	from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability
	to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us)
	and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we
	may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within
	the applicable time period, if at all. With respect to the Merger, as part of the closing conditions, we must (i) have net tangible
	assets of at least $5,000,001 after giving effect to any redemptions of public shareholders required by our organizational documents
	and our IPO prospectus (the &ldquo;Closing Redemption Offer&rdquo;), and (ii) after giving effect to the Closing Redemption Offer
	and deducting any unpaid transaction expenses, extension costs and deferred IPO offering costs, have cash and cash equivalents
	of at least $15,000,000.&nbsp;

	At any meeting called
	to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote
	for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust
	account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Any such conversions will be effected under our charter, as amended, and Cayman
	Islands law as repurchases. A holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek
	conversion of his shares.

	Notwithstanding the
	foregoing, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as
	a &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with
	respect to 30% or more of the ordinary shares sold in our initial public offering. Accordingly, all shares in excess of 30% of
	the shares sold in our initial public offering held by a holder will not be converted to cash. We believe this restriction will
	prevent shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote is held to approve a proposed business combination
	and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium
	to the then current market price. By limiting a shareholder&rsquo;s ability to convert no more than 30% of the ordinary shares
	sold in our initial public offering, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt
	to block a transaction which is favored by our other public shareholders.

	tender offer or remain an investor in our company.

	option. Once the shares are converted by the beneficial holder, and effectively repurchased by us under Cayman Island law, the
	transfer agent will then update our Register of Shareholders to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that
	we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are
	requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time the shareholder
	received our proxy statement through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise
	his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least

	There is a nominal

	The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this
	cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to
	exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing
	of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights
	prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may

	civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed
	by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands
	of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognise and enforce a foreign money judgment
	of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent
	foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain
	conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and
	for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in
	respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, and or be of a kind the enforcement of

	until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not
	have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
	standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
	that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out
	of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates
	for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, will not adopt the new or revised standard until the time private
	companies are required to adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another
	public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended
	transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.

	&nbsp;During the
	June Meeting, shareholders holding 1,054,401 public shares exercised their right to convert such public shares into a pro
	rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately $10.76 million (or approximately $10.20 per
	share) was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. In connection with the Initial Extension, the Current
	Management provided a loan to us of $0.20 for each public share that was not converted, for an aggregate amount of
	approximately $629,000, which was deposited in the trust account. In addition to the contribution, the Lender loaned us an
	additional $370,880 for our working capital needs, for an aggregate amount of $1,000,000. The loan was evidenced by the Note
	and was unsecured, non-interest bearing and is payable at our consummation of a business combination. As issued, the Note did
	not bear interest, and up to $175,000 of the principal amount of the Note is convertible at the option of the Lender into
	17,500 private placement units (consisting of one ordinary share, one right and one warrant for one-half of an ordinary
	share) at $10.00 per unit. The terms of the units are identical to the units issued by us in our initial public offering
	except that the warrants included in such units are non-redeemable by us and will be exercisable for cash or on a
	&ldquo;cashless&rdquo; basis, in each case, if held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees. If the Current
	Management converts the entire $175,000 of the principal balance of the Note, they would receive 17,500 units. If a business
	combination is not consummated, the Note will not be repaid by us and all amounts owed thereunder by us will be forgiven
	except to the extent that we have funds available outside of the trust account. As a result, as of November 30, 2016, we had
	approximately $32.8 million in the trust account, and the conversion amount per share in any subsequent business combination
	or liquidation was approximately $10.40 per share. Such funds are invested as described above and will be until the earlier

	Internal control
	over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent
	limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject
	to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented
	by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not
	be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are
	known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
	not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
	for the company.

	than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation
	can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively.
	Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result

	We have audited the accompanying

	of operations, changes in shareholders&rsquo; equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the

	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&nbsp; Those standards require that we plan and
	perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.&nbsp;
	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.&nbsp; An audit also includes examining, on
	a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.&nbsp; We
	believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	In our opinion, the financial

	The accompanying financial
	statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements,
	the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans and
	is dependent on additional financing to fund operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability
	to continue as a going concern. Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial
	statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
	and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	In December 2014,
	the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering and the Over-allotment of 4,200,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one ordinary
	share, $.0001 par value per share (&ldquo;Ordinary Share&rdquo;), one right (&ldquo;Right&rdquo;) to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary
	Share upon consummation of the Company&rsquo;s initial Business Combination and one warrant entitling the holder to purchase one-half
	of one Ordinary Share (&ldquo;Warrant&rdquo;). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds
	of $42,000,000. Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per full Ordinary
	Share commencing upon the Company&rsquo;s completion of its initial Business Combination, and expiring five years from the completion
	of the Company&rsquo;s initial Business Combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares. As a result, investors must
	exercise Warrants in multiples of two Warrants in whole and not in part, at a price of $11.50 per full share, subject to adjustment,
	to validly exercise the Warrants. The Company may redeem the Warrants at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon 30 days&rsquo; notice,
	only in the event that the last sale price of the Ordinary Shares is at least $24.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a
	30-trading day period (&ldquo;30-Day Trading Period&rdquo;) ending on the third day prior to the date on which notice of redemption
	is given, provided there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the Ordinary Shares underlying such Warrants
	commencing five business days prior to the 30-Day Trading Period and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.
	If the Company redeems the Warrants as described above, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
	Warrants to do so on a &ldquo;cashless basis.&rdquo; In accordance with the warrant agreement relating to the Warrants issued in
	the Initial Public Offering the Company is only required to use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration
	statement covering the Warrants. If a registration statement is not effective within 90 days following the consummation of a Business
	Combination, Warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the
	Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise Warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an
	available exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In the event that a registration statement
	is not effective at the time of exercise or no exemption is available for a cashless exercise, the holder of such Warrant shall
	not be entitled to exercise such Warrant for cash and in no event (whether in the case of a registration statement being effective
	or otherwise) will the Company be required to net cash settle the Warrant exercise. Additionally, in no event will the Company
	be required to net cash settle the Rights. If an initial Business Combination is not consummated, the Rights and Warrants will
	expire and will be worthless.

	Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of $2.86 million. Of the Private
	Placement Units, 265,000 were purchased by an Initial Shareholder that was an affiliate of the Company&rsquo;s former executive
	officers and 21,000 were purchased by EBC, the representative of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering. The Private Placement

	to certain permitted transferees) until the completion of the Company&rsquo;s initial Business Combination. The holders have agreed
	not to sell their shares to the Company in any tender offer in connection with the initial Business Combination.

	On December 12,
	2014, the Company entered into an agreement with EBC (&ldquo;Underwriting Agreement&rdquo;). The Underwriting Agreement
	required the Company to pay an underwriting discount of 3.25% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering as an
	underwriting discount. The Company has further engaged EBC to assist the Company with its initial Business Combination.
	Pursuant to this arrangement, the Company anticipates that the underwriter will assist the Company in holding meetings with
	shareholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target business&rsquo; attributes, introduce the Company
	to potential investors that are interested in purchasing the Company&rsquo;s securities, assist the Company in obtaining
	shareholder approval for the Business Combination and assist the Company with its press releases and public filings in
	connection with the Business Combination. The Company agreed to pay EBC a cash fee of 4% of the gross proceeds of
	the Initial Public Offering (or $1.68 million) for such services upon the consummation of its initial Business
	Combination (exclusive of any applicable finders&rsquo; fees which might become payable). The Company is not obligated to pay
	the 4% fee if no business combination is consummated. The 4% fee is an unrecognized contingent liability, as closing of a
	potential business combination was not considered probable as of November 30, 2016.

	the Company sold to EBC, for $100, a unit purchase option to purchase up to a total of 400,000 units exercisable at $11.00 per

	option expires on December 12, 2019. The units issuable upon exercise of this option are identical to the Units being offered in

	Shares (which include 40,000 Ordinary Shares to be issued for the rights included in the units) and 400,000 Warrants to purchase
	200,000 Ordinary Shares. The Company has agreed to grant to the holders of the unit purchase option, demand and &ldquo;piggy back&rdquo;

	The Company accounted
	for the fair value of the unit purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of a $100 cash payment, as an expense of the Initial Public
	Offering resulting in a charge directly to shareholders&rsquo; equity. The Company estimated that the fair value of this unit purchase
	option to be approximately $2.92 million (or $7.30 per unit) using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the
	unit purchase option granted to EBC was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility
	of 99.10%, (2) risk-free interest rate of 1.53% and (3) expected life of five years. The unit purchase option may be exercised
	for cash or on a &ldquo;cashless&rdquo; basis, at the holder&rsquo;s option (except in the case of a forced cashless exercise upon
	the Company&rsquo;s redemption of the Warrants, as described in Note 3), such that the holder may use the appreciated value of
	the unit purchase option (the difference between the exercise prices of the unit purchase option and the underlying Warrants and
	the market price of the Units and underlying Ordinary Shares) to exercise the unit purchase option without the payment of any cash.
	The Company will have no obligation to net cash settle the exercise of the unit purchase option or the Warrants underlying the
	unit purchase option. The holder of the unit purchase option will not be entitled to exercise the unit purchase option or the Warrants
	underlying the unit purchase option unless a registration statement covering the securities underlying the unit purchase option
	is effective or an exemption from registration is available. If the holder is unable to exercise the unit purchase option or underlying
	Warrants, the unit purchase option or Warrants, as applicable, will expire worthless.

	As of November 30,

	In assessing the realization
	of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
	will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
	during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers
	the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
	After consideration of all of the information available, Management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to
	future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the period ended November
	30, 2016, the valuation allowance was approximately $453,000.
