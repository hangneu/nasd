	December&nbsp;31, 2013, included in the 2015 Form 20-F have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) effective year-end 2015.

	In presenting and discussing our
	financial position, operating results and cash flows, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed in isolation as alternatives to the equivalent IFRS measure and should be used in
	conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS measure(s).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In presenting our financial
	position, fair values are used for the measurement of various items in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These fair values are based on market prices, where available, and are obtained from sources that are deemed to be reliable.
	Readers are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid at the balance sheet date. When quoted prices or observable market values do not exist, fair values are estimated using valuation models, which we believe
	are appropriate for their purpose. They require management to make significant assumptions with respect to future developments which are inherently uncertain and may therefore deviate from actual developments. Critical assumptions used are disclosed
	in the financial statements. In certain cases, independent valuations are obtained to support management&#146;s determination of fair values.

	Pursuant to provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, ProQR is providing the following cautionary statement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This document contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of ProQR and certain of
	the plans and objectives of ProQR with respect to these items. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events, including our clinical development plans
	or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of QR-010, QR-110 or any
	other pipeline program, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of QR-010, QR-110 or any other pipeline program, expressed or implied by these forward-looking
	statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified generally as those containing words as &#147;aim,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;may,&#148;

	forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Forward-looking statements appear in a number of places in this Annual Report and include,
	but are not limited to, statements regarding our intent, belief or current expectations. Forward-looking statements are based on our management&#146;s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. By their nature,
	forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events that depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. As a result, ProQR&#146;s actual future results may differ materially from the plans, goals and
	expectations set forth in such forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause future results to differ from such forward-looking statements, reference is made to the information in Item&nbsp;3.D: &#147;Risk Factors&#148;.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them in light of new information or
	future developments or to release publicly any revisions to these statements in order to reflect later events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

	We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history, engaged in the discovery and development of RNA-based therapeutics for the
	treatment of severe genetic disorders. Since our inception in February 2012, we have devoted a significant portion of our resources to the development of our lead product candidate in cystic fibrosis (CF), QR-010, as well as in other programs,
	including our lead product candidate in Leber&#146;s congenital amaurosis (LCA), QR-110. We have had significant operating losses since our inception. Our net losses for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013,&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2014 and
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 were approximately &#128; 3,253,000, &#128; 12,127,000 and &#128; 20,832,000 respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of &#128; 36,630,000. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from
	expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Our technologies and product candidates are in early stages of development, and we are subject to
	the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on novel technologies.

	To date, the only income we have generated has been

	in-license or acquire in the future.

	Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for these product candidates, we do not know when

	foreseeable future due to the cost of research and development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for product candidates. The amount of future losses is uncertain. Our ability to achieve profitability, if
	ever, will depend on, among other things, us or any future

	We
	currently have no products on the market, and our most advanced product candidate, QR-010, has only recently entered clinical development. Our business depends on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our
	product candidates, and will require additional pre-clinical testing and substantial additional clinical development and regulatory approval efforts before we are permitted to commence its commercialization, if ever. It will be several years before
	we can commence and complete a pivotal study for our product candidates, if ever. The clinical trials and manufacturing and marketing of QR-010, QR-110 and any other product candidates will be subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation
	by numerous government authorities in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions where we intend to test and, if approved, market our product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product
	candidate, we must demonstrate through pre-clinical testing and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication, and potentially in specific patient populations, including the pediatric population.
	This process can take many years and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance, which would require the expenditure of substantial resources beyond our existing funds. Of the large number of drugs in development for approval in the United
	States and the European Union, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or EMA regulatory approval processes, as applicable, and are commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund
	our research, development and clinical programs, we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized.

	We believe that we are the only company currently pursuing RNA repair technologies for the treatment of severe
	genetic disorders. We may discover that the molecules we develop to repair RNA do not possess certain properties required for a drug to be effective, such as the ability to remain stable in the human body for the period of time required for the drug
	to reach the target tissue or the ability to cross the cell wall and enter into cells within the target tissue for effective delivery. We may spend substantial funds attempting to introduce these properties and may never succeed in doing so. In
	addition, product candidates based on RNA repair may demonstrate different chemical and pharmacological properties in humans than they do in laboratory studies or animals. Even if our product candidates, such as QR-010 and QR-110, have successful
	results in animal studies, they may not demonstrate the same chemical and pharmacological properties in humans and may interact with human biological systems or other existing treatments in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. Our RNA repair
	technologies may provoke an unwanted immune response, or immunogenicity, which may neutralize the therapeutic effects of our product candidates and could result in harmful outcomes for patients. As a result, we may never succeed in developing a
	marketable product, we may not become profitable and the value of our ordinary shares would decline.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, the FDA and the EMA have relatively
	limited experience with therapeutics based on RNA repair. To our knowledge, no regulatory authority has granted approval to any person or entity, including us, to market and commercialize therapeutics using RNA repair technologies, which may
	increase the complexity, uncertainty and length of the regulatory approval process for our product candidates. Neither we nor any future collaborator may receive approval to market and commercialize any product candidate. Even if we or a
	collaborator were to obtain regulatory approval, the approval may be for disease indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety
	warnings. We or a collaborator may be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval or be subject to post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If our RNA repair technology proves to be
	ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, our entire platform and pipeline would have little, if any, value, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

	In order to market and sell our products in jurisdictions other than the United States and the European Union, we

	and EMA approval, but can involve additional testing. We may need to partner with third parties in order to obtain approvals outside the United States and the European Union. In addition, in many countries worldwide, it is required that the product
	be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States and the European Union on a timely basis, if at all. Even if we were to
	receive approval in the United States or the European Union, approval by the FDA or the EMA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. Similarly, approval by one regulatory authority outside the United
	States and the European Union would not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA or the EMA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to
	commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of QR-010, QR-110 or any of our other product candidates by regulatory authorities in other foreign jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of those product candidates may

	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs
	for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population
	of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States who have been diagnosed as having the disease or condition at the time of the submission of the request for orphan drug designation. Under Regulation No. (EC) 141/2000 on Orphan Medicinal
	Products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if, among other things, it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five
	in 10,000 people in the European Union when the application is made. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is
	entitled to a period of market exclusivity. This exclusivity precludes the EMA or the FDA, as applicable, from approving another marketing application for the same or, in the EU, a similar drug for the same indication for that time period, unless,
	among other things, the later product is clinically superior. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union following marketing approval. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug
	no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.

	life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. For product candidates that have been
	designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective

	not to make such designation. The availability of breakthrough therapy designation was established with the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, and while the FDA has released guidance as to the criteria it
	uses in designating drugs as breakthrough therapies, we cannot be sure that our product candidates will meet the FDA&#146;s qualifying criteria for such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product
	candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our

	If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products
	or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S. and in most European countries, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace.
	Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone
	connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. PTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is
	unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion
	of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse

	The availability of reimbursement by
	governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of these product candidates
	will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If
	reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to
	establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance
	coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S.
	Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will
	decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. For example,
	a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the United States and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain European countries.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The intended use of a drug product by a physician can also affect pricing. For example, CMS could initiate a National Coverage Determination administrative
	procedure, by which the agency determines which uses of a therapeutic product would and would not be reimbursable under Medicare. This determination process can be lengthy, thereby creating a long period during which the future reimbursement for a
	particular product may be uncertain.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Outside the United States, particularly in member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is
	subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations or the successful completion of health technology assessment procedures with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a
	product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Certain countries allow companies to fix their own prices for
	medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by
	various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other
	studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our RNA repair candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further
	pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of any product candidate approved for marketing is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at
	unsatisfactory levels, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be adversely affected.

	In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the

	In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare Modernization Act, established the Medicare
	Part D program and provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class thereunder. The Medicare Modernization Act, including its cost reduction initiatives, could decrease the coverage and reimbursement
	rate that we receive for any of our approved products. Furthermore, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from
	the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes a
	significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. It also contains substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending,
	enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health
	policy reforms, any of which could negatively impact our business. A significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective, but the Affordable Care Act is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical and
	medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.

	We expect that the

	product, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or
	other healthcare reforms may compromise our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.

	We

	increasingly expensive. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be
	substantial, particularly in light of the size of our business and financial resources. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our share price to decline and, if we are unsuccessful in defending such a claim or
	claims and the resulting judgments exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

	We are an innovative biopharmaceutical company
	engaged in the discovery and development of RNA-based therapeutics for the treatment of severe genetic orphan disorders. Utilizing our unique proprietary RNA repair technologies we are building a pipeline in severe genetic disorders. We believe we
	can target rare genetic disorders in which a single protein is defective due to certain types of genetic mutations. We design our therapeutic candidates to specifically target and repair the defective messenger RNA, or mRNA, that is transcribed from
	a mutated gene in order to restore functional or normal (wild-type) protein and therefore, we believe, has the potential to modify the disease. We believe that this unique approach offers several advantages compared with small molecule, gene therapy
	and other therapeutic approaches in the treatment of certain genetic diseases. Our current clinical stage molecule is QR-010, a single stranded RNA-based oligonucleotide that is designed to repair the genetic defect in the most prevalent mutation in
	cystic fibrosis, or CF. We are currently studying this molecule in two global clinical trials in 80 CF patients. Our second molecule is QR-110, a single stranded RNA-based oligonucleotide that targets the most prevalent mutation in the CEP290 gene
	for Leber&#146;s congenital amaurosis, or LCA, patients and is currently in preclinical development. Beyond that, our in-house discovery engine that we call the innovation unit has been active in building a pipeline based upon our toolbox of RNA
	technologies that we have in-licensed or developed in-house. We have launched a number of discovery programs including programs in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Usher syndrome, Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), Huntington&#146;s
	disease, Alzheimer&#146;s disease and Friedreich&#146;s ataxia.

	the mRNA, which results in the production of wild-type CEP290 protein. The p.Cys998X mutation is a substitution of one nucleotide in the pre-mRNA that leads to a defective mRNA and non-functional protein. QR-110 is designed to bind to the mutated
	location in the pre-mRNA, thereby leading to normally spliced or wild-type mRNA, which could produce wild-type or normal protein. QR-110 is designed to be administered through intravitreal injections in the eye. We believe the activity in
	pre-clinical models of LCA provides support for the clinical development and therapeutic potential of QR-110. In 2016 we intend to start our first clinical trial directly in LCA patients. There is recent precedent for an accelerated development path
	in another LCA mutation, and we believe this accelerated development pathway can also be applied to QR-110.

	Beyond CF and LCA, our innovation unit, which is our internal discovery engine, is currently evaluating over 100 disease targets through our internal research
	or that of external collaborators. These disease targets are based on our multiple RNA technologies that were discovered internally or in-licensed. We have a rigorous evaluation process in identifying programs for our pipeline that includes
	establishing genetic causality, ability to deliver to the target organ, intellectual property protection, strong proof of concept, and a high unmet need. Our early stage programs are in various stages of discovery and target different severe genetic
	disorders where we believe our technologies have the potential to make a life altering impact for affected patients. These include programs for epidermolysis bullosa, a severe genetic skin disorder that impacts young children, Usher syndrome and
	Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) programs in areas of ophthalmology with high unmet medical need, programs in our early central nervous system, or CNS, franchise that include Huntington&#146;s disease and Alzheimer&#146;s disease as well

	Genes are the specific sequences of DNA that provide the blueprint used by the human body&#146;s cells to make proteins, which are enzymes or other molecules
	in cells that serve a functional purpose. Each gene consists of a specific sequence of nucleotides that leads to the production of a specific protein. The gene&#146;s coding DNA sequence is transcribed into mRNA, which is subsequently translated
	into the specific protein. A mutation, or defect, in a specific gene can result in the transcription of abnormal mRNA, which then can produce a defective, misfolded or truncated protein that is unable to carry out its normal function.

	In the maturing RNA therapeutics space and the developments in understanding their potential, we have gathered a toolbox of different novel RNA technologies
	with which we believe we can repair and modulate defective mRNA in order to restore protein functionality. This is unlike other approaches in the RNA therapeutics field, such as RNAi and antisense that use RNA molecules to downregulate genes. All
	our approaches employ single-stranded RNA-based oligonucleotides that are chemically modified (phosphorothioate backbone and 2&#146; O-methyl modifications) so that no vector or envelope is needed for delivery. Our molecules are designed to act as
	guide sequences to repair or modulate the targeted abnormal mRNA. The repaired mRNA then acts as a template to generate protein. We believe these RNA approaches will allow us to develop novel therapies for genetic disorders that are currently
	untreatable or have limited effective treatment options.

	CF is the most common
	fatal inherited disease in the Western world and affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide. There is no cure for CF. CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, frequent hospitalizations and ultimately
	lung transplants, which can extend life for five years on average. The quality of life for CF patients is compromised by approximately four hours of self-care per day and frequent outpatient doctor visits and hospitalizations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CF is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes the CFTR protein. The CFTR protein channel regulates the movement, or efflux, of specific ions in and out of
	the cells of organs like the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. Through regulation of these ions, the amount of salts in the fluid both inside and outside the cell remains balanced. In CF patients, however, the CFTR protein is defective and
	cannot perform its normal function of transporting ions across the cell membrane, and this results in an environment characterized by thick mucus in vital organs such as the lung, the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract. The figure below
	illustrates a defective CFTR protein hampering the efflux of chloride in lung epithelial cells.

	The lack of functional CFTR in CF patients is particularly problematic in the lungs, where the build-up of thick mucus
	obstructs parts of the lung, allows bacteria to grow unfettered and impairs the functionality of the local immune system. Of all the manifestations of CF, lung disease is the most critical and is characterized by a combination of airway obstruction,
	infection and inflammation such that more than 90% of all CF patients die of respiratory failure. In the pancreas, the buildup of mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that help the body break down food and absorb important nutrients. In
	the GI tract, the thick mucus leads to impaired ability to absorb nutrients. The median age of death for all CF patients in the U.S. is 27 years.

	of CF patients are diagnosed by the age of two. CF can be diagnosed by conducting a Nasal Potential Difference, or NPD, test that measures CFTR activity in the nose, or a pilocarpine iontophoretic sweat chloride test, which measures the amount of
	salt in a person&#146;s sweat. A genetic test is also often used to confirm a CF diagnosis and/or identify the disease-causing mutations. In a genetic test, a blood sample or cells from the inside of the cheek are taken and sent to a laboratory that
	specializes in genetic testing.

	There is no cure for CF, and to date,
	all but one of the therapies approved to treat CF patients have been designed to treat the symptoms rather than address the underlying cause. CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, frequent hospitalizations and
	ultimately lung transplant, which is life-extending but not curative. In the United States, the average CF patient incurs approximately $50,000 per year in expenses for outpatient medications and services and substantial additional costs for
	frequent hospitalizations. As the median age of death for CF patients is 27, this results in an average lifetime cost per CF patient in the U.S. of $1,350,000 in outpatient expenses alone. CF patients who can be treated with Vertex&#146;s Kalydeco
	or Orkambi have additional annual costs of approximately $300,000. Standards of care are generally similar across Western European nations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The current standard of care for CF patients includes palliative treatment to manage the symptoms of the disease. In CF patients, the thick
	mucus that builds up in the lungs and other vital organs such as the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract hampers mucus clearance and leads to airway obstruction and difficulty absorbing nutrients, leading to poor growth and development. Primary
	treatment options include inhaled therapies such as rhDNase, marketed as Pulmozyme, which thins the mucus in the lungs, as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which improves absorption of nutrients. Due to the proliferation of bacteria on
	the mucus build-up, CF patients often develop chronic lung infections that require inhaled antibiotics treatments, such as TOBI or Cayston, to suppress the infections. CF patients also take a number of other prescribed and over-the-counter
	medications to alleviate the symptoms of CF and reduce complications, including bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and ursodeoxycholic acid for biliary tree dysfunction.

	For a subset of patients who suffer from the G551D and other gating mutations of the CFTR gene, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has developed a so-called
	&#147;potentiator&#148; molecule marketed under the trade name Kalydeco (ivacaftor). This product was approved by the FDA in 2012 to treat patients with the G551D CFTR mutation and, in 2014, the label was expanded to include eight additional gating
	mutations. In 2015, the label was further expanded to include a total of ten gating mutations and children as young as two years old. Vertex has estimated that approximately 2,400 CF patients in the U.S., Europe and Australia have a G551D or a
	non-G551D gating mutation. Gating mutations are characterized by the presence of CFTR at the cell surface that does not open and close the ion channels properly. Kalydeco is believed to keep the ion channels open for longer. For this population of
	CF patients, medication costs are approximately $300,000 per year for Kalydeco prescriptions. Kalydeco is an exciting development as it provides a proof of concept that it is possible to target the defective CFTR protein that causes CF and improve
	key symptoms of the disease.

	Gene therapy is a process in which a
	functional gene is introduced into a cell to override the effects of a defective gene. The CFTR gene was first identified in 1989. Since that time, several academic consortia and drug-development companies have attempted to develop gene therapies
	targeting mutations in the CFTR gene. These companies aimed to permanently correct the CFTR gene at the DNA level by delivering full-length CFTR genes to lung epithelial cells to express wild-type CFTR protein. However, these programs encountered
	limitations faced by gene therapy in general as well as limitations specific to the CFTR gene. These barriers included safety concerns, challenges in delivery of the gene therapy constructs to target cells in the lungs, challenges of both delivery
	and incorporation into the genome given the size and complexity of the CFTR gene, and immunologic responses to the gene therapy vectors. The most advanced effort in gene therapy for CF is with an academic consortium in the U.K. In 2015, the Gene
	Therapy Consortium presented results of a 136-patient trial using a CFTR gene delivered in a liposome envelope. While the trial showed no overall efficacy, specific subgroups did show a modest benefit in lung function compared to the placebo group.
	The Gene Therapy Consortium has announced that they will conduct a follow-up trial of gene therapy in the future but that a different vector will be needed for delivery of the gene.

	The Ussing Chamber assay measures the electrical current over a monolayer of epithelial cells and is a commonly used pre-clinical assay to measure the chloride

	nanomolars (nMs), twice weekly) in CF HBE cultures following repeated treatments over 14 days. The goal of the study was to show improvement in CFTR activity over time. The study achieved its goal by demonstrating that treatment over 14 days with
	QR-010 enhanced its effect on CFTR activity. The figure below shows the results of the Ussing Chamber assay and the efficacy of QR-010 treatment on CFTR activity over different QR-010 treatment periods. After the addition of a cAMP stimulator,
	forskolin, to activate the CFTR protein, we observed an increase in ion current across the cell membrane that represents CFTR activity. To confirm that the observed result was due to restored CFTR function and not an alternative pathway, a CFTR
	inhibitor was administered and the effect on ion current was extinguished in a selective manner.

	severe LCA disease phenotype. Most patients affected by this mutation lose sight in the first years of life. There is currently no disease modifying therapy available on the market or being tested in clinical development for this specific subtype of
	the disease. In LCA patients this mutation leads to significant decrease of CEP290 protein within the photoreceptor cells in the retina. Clinical features of CEP290-mediated LCA include congenital or early onset loss of vision, involuntary eye
	movement or nystagmus, amaurotic pupils and no light response on electroretinography (ERG).

	The p.Cys998X mutation is a single nucleotide substitution in the CEP290 gene that creates a new splice site, also called a cryptic site, between exon 26 and
	27. During the splicing of the pre-mRNA this causes a part of the intron, or pseudoexon, to be included in the mRNA. The pseudoexon contains a premature stop codon thus the mRNA is not translated into the full length CEP290 protein. The CEP290
	protein is involved in the formation and stability of the connecting cilium in photoreceptor cells which facilitates the transport of proteins from the inner segment to the outer segment. When CEP290 is absent there is protein build-up in the inner
	segment and the outer segment is shorter and does not perform its light transducing function.

	We believe that approximately 116,000 patients worldwide suffer from LCA. LCA is caused by a genetic defect in 19 or more associated genes. The most common
	mutation is the p.Cys998X in the CEP290 gene. Although diagnosis rates vary, based on our estimations we believe this mutation occurs in approximately 2,000 patients in the Western world.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Patients are initially diagnosed through the presence of clinical symptoms. Nystagmus tends to be the first symptom visible as well as oculo-digital
	movements, in the most severe cases; vision impairment or blindness becomes obvious as age increases. After ophthalmological examination, LCA is diagnosed. A genetic screening including all known mutations causing LCA is performed to distinguish
	between LCA and other possible retinal diseases and to give the patient the most accurate prognosis possible (approximately 30% of all patients carry a mutation that has not been described to date).

	approved, out of which two were for ophthalmologic indications that are also administered through intravitreal injections. No gene therapy product has been so far approved by FDA and only one is approved in the EU. Spark Therapeutics is currently

	repair therapeutics in genetic indications with a high unmet medical need. Leveraging our experience with RNA therapeutics, we are screening for therapeutic molecules that can be used to treat severe genetic disorders beyond CF and LCA. We have
	built a diverse toolbox of RNA technologies that we believe can address underlying genetic defects in a novel way. We have grouped the different programs in franchises by therapeutic area so that we can leverage our expertise in the different fields
	and create synergies between programs. We have identified five therapeutic areas that show high potential for RNA based oligonucleotides: respiratory, ophthalmology, dermatology, CNS and neuromuscular disorders. We go through a thorough selection
	process prior to advancing programs into development, and consider criteria including: high unmet medical need, a pre-clinical proof-of-concept that shows strong promise for translation to the clinic, well understood relationship between the genetic
	defect and disease manifestations, feasibility of delivery to target organ(s), and strong IP position and initial freedom to operate.

	FECD is a common inherited condition characterized by the
	dysfunction and degeneration of the corneal endothelium. The disease segregates into early-onset and age-related FECD that are caused by different mutations. Early signs of FECD are the presence of corneal guttae and a large proportion of patients
	over 40 years old have evident corneal guttae. A portion of these patients develop advanced disease with corneal edema and corneal clouding. These symptoms can worsen leading to complete vision loss and the requirement for surgical intervention and
	a corneal transplant. There are currently no other treatment options for any form of FECD patients with vision loss, apart from corneal transplantation. However, transplantation has several limitations, including the availability of donors, risk of
	rejection, the inherent risk of an invasive procedure and is only available to patients with advanced FECD. The majority of age-related FECD is caused by a repeat expansion mutation in the TCF4 gene. Such expansions result in toxic RNA species which
	aggregate as nuclear foci and sequester important splicing proteins rendering the cell devoid of the splicing proteins for other important genes. The impact of acquired splicing defects in these other genes are thought to result in corneal
	endothelial dysfunction and Fuchs. Our program, called QRX-504, aims to prevent the buildup of RNA-protein foci that cause the corneal dystrophy in patients with expansion repeat mutation in the TCF4 gene by using a single stranded RNA

	In May 2012, we entered into a license agreement with MGH. Under the terms of this license agreement, we have an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under
	certain MGH patent rights to make, use and sell any product or process that is covered by the licensed patent rights for use in all therapeutic indications in the field of cystic fibrosis. We may sublicense our rights unless MGH objects to a
	potential sublicensee because of a conflict of interest. Our sublicensees may not further sublicense nor assign their rights without MGH&#146;s consent. MGH retains the right for it, its affiliates and other academic, government and not-for-profit
	institutions to use the licensed patents rights for internal research and educational purposes. If we ever desire to expand the license field beyond CF, we must provide to MGH a development plan that demonstrates we have sufficient resources to
	commercially develop a therapeutic indication in that field and MGH would then engage in good faith negotiations with us for a license covering such field on substantially the same terms as those contained in the license agreement.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, in lieu of an upfront license payment to MGH, we are obligated to reimburse MGH, on a pro rata basis based on
	the number of licensees under the licensed patent rights, the fees and costs incurred by MGH in preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patent rights. Currently, we are the sole licensee of the MGH patent rights and have paid
	approximately $ 165,000 in patent fee reimbursements to MGH. We are also obligated to pay MGH up to $ 700,000 in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and, beginning after our first commercial sale
	of a product covered by the licensed patent rights, a $ 10,000 annual license fee which is creditable against royalties due to MGH in the same calendar year. In addition, we are obligated to pay MGH 2% of any net sales by us, our affiliates or
	sublicensees on licensed products made or sold in the United States, as well as a low double-digit percentage of any payments that we may receive from any sublicensee anywhere in the world.

	MGH is responsible for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights. MGH has the first right to protect the licensed
	patent rights from alleged infringement. If MGH declines to prosecute the alleged infringement, we may, at our expense, initiate legal proceedings against the alleged infringer, provided that we must give prior notice to MGH, obtain MGH&#146;s prior
	written consent in some cases, reasonably cooperate with MGH regarding the proposed action and not settle any proceeding without MGH&#146;s prior written consent. We must also indemnify MGH against any costs, expenses and liabilities incurred in
	connection with any such legal proceeding we initiate. Any award recovered from the alleged infringer after we and MGH are reimbursed for our expenses are shared so that we receive an amount equal to our lost profits or a reasonable royalty on the
	infringing sales, MGH receives an amount equal to the royalties or other payments we would have paid MGH if we had sold the infringing product, and any remainder is shared equally.

	the license agreement or grant us an extension and require us to pay additional milestone fees and, in some cases, an increased royalty on net sales, depending upon the length of our delay. The license agreement will remain in effect until the date
	on which all issued patents and filed patent applications under the licensed patent rights have expired or been abandoned. We may terminate the license agreement for any reason by giving MGH 90 days advance written notice of termination. MGH may
	terminate the license agreement upon our default of certain obligations under the license agreement which is not cured within a specified period of time or if we, our affiliates or sublicensees challenge the validity of the licensed patent rights.
	If we challenge the validity of the licensed patent rights during the term of the license agreement and they are found to be valid and enforceable, we must reimburse MGH for its legal costs and expenses in defending the challenge. Upon a termination

	The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for
	substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is
	subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for
	its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be
	manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required
	specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including
	clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions.

	The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require
	additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always
	conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all
	of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA that must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring
	additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may
	either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing.

	If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise
	be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies,
	including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a drug&#146;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may
	require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program as a condition of approval, which could entail requirements for long-term patient follow-up, a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe
	use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.

	Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new
	drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.
	Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product concurrently with, or at any time
	after, submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic
	benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably
	likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a
	surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured
	more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials sometimes referred to as Phase 4
	trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis.
	All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

	In addition to other

	available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of each portion of the NDA and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin

	reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying
	with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Moreover, each component of a combination product retains their regulatory status (as a drug or device, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of
	component. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the
	approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process
	generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

	Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the

	production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot
	prior to its release. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract

	The FDA may withdraw a product approval if
	compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal
	of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, untitled or warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product seizures,

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited
	patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term
	lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period
	is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time
	during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent
	and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed
	patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will
	be granted to us.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a
	five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug
	containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA
	submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a
	certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that
	were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of
	use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
	However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing
	exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric
	clinical trial in accordance with an FDA-issued &#147;Written Request&#148; for such a clinical trial.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition&#151;generally a disease or
	condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United&nbsp;States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential
	orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active
	ingredient to treat a particular disease or condition with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the
	FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product to the product with orphan
	drug exclusivity through a demonstration of superior safety, superior efficacy, or a major contribution to patient care. &#147;Same drug&#148; means, with respect to a drug composed of large molecules (macromolecules), a drug that contains the same
	principal molecular structural features (but not necessarily all of the same structural features) and is intended for the same use as a previously approved drug, except that if the subsequent drug can be shown to be clinically superior to the first
	drug, it will not be considered to be the same drug. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of
	orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United
	States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed
	care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the
	drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage
	for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in
	product development.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical need and cost-effectiveness of medical products
	and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical need
	and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be
	cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid
	health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health
	Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of
	Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#146; share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls
	and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost
	containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and
	reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

	The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things,
	knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can
	be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#145;&#145;cause&#146;&#146; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In
	addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and
	third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their
	off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $ 5,500 and $ 11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential
	for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition,
	private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.

	The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services a condition for
	states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#146;s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing
	pharmaceutical manufacturers&#146; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new
	rebate calculation for &#145;&#145;line extensions&#146;&#146; (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the
	statutory definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding
	the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits, to be phased-in by 2014. The Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as
	well. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public
	availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.

	In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to
	entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act
	expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#146;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B

	2016 or later by Regulation (EU) No 536/2014) provides a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union via implementation through national legislation of the Member States. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the
	competent national authorities of the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical
	trial application, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in
	applicable guidance documents. The sponsor of a clinical trial, or its legal representative, must be based in the European Economic Area. European regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of adverse event reports during a study
	and a copy of the final study report.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Marketing approvals under the European Union regulatory system may be obtained through a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure
	results in the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all&#151;currently 28&#151;European Union Member States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to
	Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;726/2004, as amended, the centralized procedure is mandatory for drugs developed by means of specified biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;1394/2007, drugs
	for human use containing a new active substance for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of specified diseases, including but not limited to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, auto-immune diseases and
	other immune dysfunctions, as well as drugs designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;141/2000. The CHMP also has the discretion to permit other products to use the centralized procedure if it considers them sufficiently
	innovative or they contain a new active substance. Given the fact that QR-010 has been granted orphan designation in the EU, it qualifies for the centralized procedure.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the marketing authorization application, or MAA, the applicant has to properly and sufficiently demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug.
	Under the centralized approval procedure, the CHMP, possibly in conjunction with other committees, is responsible for drawing up the opinion of the EMA on any matter concerning the admissibility of the files submitted in accordance with the
	centralized procedure, such as an opinion on the granting, variation, suspension or revocation of a marketing authorization, and pharmacovigilance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	CHMP and other committees are also responsible for providing guidance and have published numerous guidelines that may apply to our product candidates. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation
	to the development and evaluation of drug products and may include, among other things, the preclinical studies required in specific cases; and the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post-approval measures
	required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any of our product
	candidates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the CHMP under the centralized procedure is 210 days after receipt of a valid
	application. This period will be suspended until such time as any supplementary information requested by the CHMP, has been provided by the applicant. Likewise, this time-limit will be suspended for the time allowed for the applicant to prepare oral
	or written explanations. When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug which is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the
	applicant may request an accelerated assessment procedure. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time-limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time-limit for the centralized procedure
	if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the
	product is sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. This is sent to the European Commission which drafts a decision. After consulting with the Member States, the European Commission adopts a decision and grants a marketing authorization,
	which is valid for the whole of the European Union. The marketing authorization may be subject to certain conditions, which may include, without limitation, the performance of post-authorization safety and/or efficacy studies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	European Union legislation also provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC)
	No.&nbsp;726/2004, as amended, and Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of complete independent data package benefit from eight years of data
	exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#146;s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application. During the additional
	two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#146;s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall
	ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder, or MAH, obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the
	scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of
	data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical test, pre-clinical tests and
	clinical trials. However, products designated as orphan medicinal products enjoy, upon receiving marketing authorization, a period of 10 years of orphan market exclusivity&#151;see also &#147;&#151;Orphan Drug Regulation&#148;. Depending upon the
	timing and duration of the EU marketing authorization process, products may be eligible for up to five years&#146; supplementary protection certification, or SPC, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;469/2009. Such SPCs extend the rights under the
	basic patent for the drug.

	public systems reimbursement for standard drugs is determined by guidelines established by the legislator or responsible national authority. The approach taken varies by Member State. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems
	under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other Member States allow

	companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict reimbursement. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general,
	particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products and some of EU countries require the completion of studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a
	particular product candidate to currently available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan drugs. Inclusion of orphan drugs in reimbursement systems tend to focus
	on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any drug. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come with cost, use and often volume restrictions, which again can vary
	by country. In addition, results based rules of reimbursement may apply.

	order to restore functional or normal (wild-type) protein and therefore has the potential to modify the disease. This unique approach offers several advantages compared with small molecule, gene therapy and other therapeutic approaches in the
	treatment of certain genetic diseases. Our current clinical stage molecule is QR-010, a single stranded RNA-based oligonucleotide that is designed to repair the genetic defect in the most prevalent mutation in cystic fibrosis, or CF. We are
	currently studying this program in two global clinical trials in 80 CF patients. Our second molecule is QR-110, a single stranded RNA-based oligonucleotide that targets the most prevalent mutation in the CEP290 gene for LCA patients and is currently
	in pre-clinical development. Beyond that, our in-house discovery engine that we call the innovation unit has been very active in building a pipeline beyond CF and LCA based upon our toolbox of RNA technologies that we have in-licensed or developed
	in-house. We have launched a number of discovery programs including programs in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Usher syndrome, Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), Huntington&#146;s disease, Alzheimer&#146;s disease and Friedreich&#146;s

	to a lesser extent from funding from governmental bodies and patient organizations, including Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., or CFFT, a subsidiary of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. From our inception on February&nbsp;21, 2012
	through December&nbsp;31, 2015, we raised gross proceeds of approximately &#128;45.6&nbsp;million from private placements of equity securities, including &#128;2,500,000 from the conversion of a convertible loan, &#128;4,228,000 in loans from a
	governmental body and approximately &#128;3,640,000 in grants from patient organizations and the European Commission. In September 2014, we raised gross proceeds of &#128; 87,202,000 (net proceeds of &#128;80,376,000) from our initial public
	offering of 8,625,000 ordinary shares. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of &#128;94,865,000. To date, we have not generated any revenues from royalties or product sales. Based on our current plans, we do not expect to

	Our source of financing in 2015 was funding from a governmental body amounting to &#128; 1,640,000. We also established an ATM
	facility that may serve as a source of funding in upcoming years. Our sources of financing in 2014 were our IPO providing net proceeds of &#128; 80,376,000, a private placement of equity securities and exercises of options providing total net
	proceeds of &#128; 40,434,000, including conversion of a convertible loan of &#128; 2,560,000, including interest, provided in 2013 by existing shareholders, and funding from a governmental body amounting to &#128; 1,667,000. Our sources of
	financing in 2013 were private placements of equity securities providing total net proceeds of &#128; 3,023,000, a convertible loan from existing shareholders of &#128; 2,500,000 and funding from a governmental body amounting to &#128; 826,000.

	During 2014, we moved our laboratory facilities to increase and enhance our research and development capacity, which resulted
	in additional investments in laboratory and office equipment. To facilitate the growing needs of our company and accommodate the increased staff levels, we also moved our offices in March 2015. In addition, we opened our U.S. office in Palo Alto
	(CA) and invested in our IT infrastructure. These changes led to increasing investments in tangible fixed assets in 2015, funded from existing cash balances.

	Our
	supervisory board is responsible for the supervision of the activities of our management board and our company&#146;s general affairs and business. Our supervisory board may, also on its own initiative, provide the management board with advice and
	may request any information from the management board that it deems appropriate. In performing its duties, the supervisory board is required to act in the interests of our company (including its stakeholders) and its associated business as a whole.
	The members of the supervisory board are not authorized to represent us in dealings with third parties.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to Dutch law, members of the supervisory
	board must be natural persons. Under our articles of association, the number of supervisory board members is determined by our supervisory board itself, provided there will be at least three supervisory board members. Our articles of association
	provide that members of the supervisory board are appointed by the general meeting of shareholders upon a binding nomination by the supervisory board. Our general meeting of shareholders may at all times deprive such a nomination of its binding
	character by a resolution passed by at least two-thirds of the votes cast representing more than 50% of our issued share capital, following which our supervisory board shall draw up a new binding nomination.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our supervisory board rules provide that members of our supervisory board will serve for a maximum duration of three four-year terms. Our articles of
	association provide that the supervisory board members must retire periodically in accordance with a rotation schedule adopted by the supervisory board. A supervisory board member who retires in accordance with the rotation schedule can be
	reappointed immediately. The rotation schedule provides that the terms of office of the members of our supervisory board are staggered, such that approximately one-fourth of our supervisory board members will be subject to election in any one year
	and which has the effect of creating a staggered board (which may in turn deter a takeover attempt). The supervisory board appoints a chairman from among its members.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under our articles of association, the general meeting of shareholders may suspend or remove supervisory board members at any time. A resolution of our
	general meeting of shareholders to suspend or remove a supervisory board member may be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast, provided that the resolution is based on a proposal by our supervisory board. In the absence of a proposal by our
	supervisory board, a resolution of our general meeting of shareholders to suspend or remove a supervisory board member shall require a majority of at least two-thirds of the votes cast representing more than 50% of our issued share capital.
</P>

	Under Dutch law, management board members, supervisory board members and certain other representatives may be held liable for damages in the event of improper
	or negligent performance of their duties. They may be held jointly and severally liable for damages to the company for infringement of the articles of association or of certain provisions of the Dutch Civil Code. They may also be liable towards
	third parties for infringement of certain provisions of the Dutch Civil Code. In certain circumstances they may also incur additional specific civil and criminal liabilities.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our articles of association provide that we will indemnify our management board members, supervisory board members, former management board members and former
	supervisory board members (each an &#147;Indemnified Person&#148;) against (i)&nbsp;any financial losses or damages incurred by such Indemnified Person and (ii)&nbsp;any expense reasonably paid or incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection
	with any threatened, pending or completed suit, claim, action or legal proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal, in which he becomes involved, to the extent this relates to his position
	with the company, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. No indemnification shall be given to an Indemnified Person (a)&nbsp;if a Dutch court has established, without possibility for appeal, that the acts or omissions of
	such Indemnified Person that led to the financial losses, damages, suit, claim, action or legal proceedings result from either an improper performance of his duties as an officer of the company or an unlawful or illegal act and (b)&nbsp;to the
	extent that his financial losses, damages and expenses are covered by an insurance and the insurer has settled these financial losses, damages and expenses (or has indicated that it would do so). Our supervisory board may stipulate additional terms,
	conditions and restrictions in relation to such indemnification.

	The percentage of shares beneficially owned is based on a total of 23,345,965&nbsp;ordinary shares outstanding as at December&nbsp;31, 2015. The numbers and
	percentages of ordinary shares beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the SEC governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under the applicable SEC rules, a person is deemed to be a &#147;beneficial
	owner&#148; of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of such security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security,
	or to receive the economic benefit of ownership of the securities. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days of December&nbsp;31, 2015, and such
	securities are considered outstanding for the purpose of calculating the percentage ownership of that person but not for the purpose of calculating the percentage ownership of any other person. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed
	beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic interest. Except as otherwise indicated, each of the beneficial owners has, to our knowledge, sole
	voting and investment power with respect to the indicated ordinary shares, subject to community property laws, where applicable. Except as otherwise set forth below, the address of the beneficial owner is c/o ProQR Therapeutics N.V., Darwinweg 24,
	2333 CR, Leiden, the Netherlands.

	Pursuant to legislation to counteract &#147;dividend stripping&#148;, a reduction, exemption, credit or refund of
	Dutch dividend withholding tax is denied if the recipient of the dividend is not the beneficial owner as described in the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act 1965 (in Dutch: &#147;
<I>
	Wet op de dividendbelasting 1965

	generally targets situations in which a shareholder retains its economic interest in shares but reduces the withholding tax costs on dividends by a transaction with another party. It is not required for these rules to apply that the recipient of the
	dividends is aware that a dividend stripping transaction took place. The Dutch State Secretary of Finance takes the position that the definition of beneficial ownership introduced by this legislation will also be applied in the context of a double

	Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income, signed on December&nbsp;18, 1992, as amended and currently in force, or the U.S.-Netherlands Tax Treaty, although there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, the IRS has determined that the
	U.S.-Netherlands Tax Treaty is satisfactory for purposes of the qualified dividend rules and that it includes an exchange-of-information program. Therefore, subject to the discussion under &#147;Passive Foreign Investment Company
	Considerations,&#148; below, if the U.S.-Netherlands Tax Treaty is applicable, such dividends will generally be &#147;qualified dividend income&#148; in the hands of individual U.S. holders, provided that certain conditions are met, including

	A U.S. holder generally may claim the amount of Dutch income withholding tax withheld as either a deduction from gross income or a credit against U.S. federal
	income tax liability. However, the foreign tax credit is subject to numerous complex limitations that must be determined and applied on an individual basis. Generally, the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of a U.S. holder&#146;s U.S.
	federal income tax liability that such U.S. holder&#146;s taxable income bears to such U.S. holder&#146;s worldwide taxable income. In applying this limitation, a U.S. holder&#146;s various items of income and deduction must be classified, under
	complex rules, as either &#147;foreign source&#148; or &#147;U.S. source.&#148; In addition, this limitation is calculated separately with respect to specific categories of income. The amount of a distribution with respect to the ordinary shares
	that is treated as a &#147;dividend&#148; may be lower for U.S. federal income tax purposes than it is for Dutch income tax purposes, potentially resulting in a reduced foreign tax credit for the U.S. holder. Each U.S. holder should consult its own
	tax advisors regarding the foreign tax credit rules.

	In general, the amount of a distribution paid to a U.S. holder in a foreign currency will be the
	dollar value of the foreign currency calculated by reference to the spot exchange rate on the day the U.S. holder receives the distribution, regardless of whether the foreign currency is converted into U.S. dollars at that time. Any foreign currency
	gain or loss a U.S. holder realizes on a subsequent conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss. If dividends received in a foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars on the day they are
	received, a U.S. holder should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend.

	&#148; below, this gain or loss will generally be a capital gain or loss and will generally be treated as from sources within the United States. The
	adjusted tax basis in an ordinary share generally will be equal to the cost of such ordinary share. Capital gain from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of ordinary shares of a non-corporate U.S. holder is generally eligible for a

	is long-term taxable gain). The deductibility of capital losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitations under the Code. Any such gain or loss that a U.S. holder recognizes generally will be treated as U.S. source income or

	For a cash basis taxpayer, units of foreign currency paid or received are translated into U.S. dollars

	year to year. Such election may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. For an accrual basis taxpayer who does not make such election, units of foreign currency paid or received are translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the trade

	If we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, in any taxable year, a U.S. holder would be subject to special rules generally intended
	to reduce or eliminate any benefits from the deferral of U.S. federal income tax that a U.S. holder could derive from investing in a non-U.S. company that does not distribute all of its earnings on a current basis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A corporation organized outside the United States generally will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which,
	after applying certain look-through rules with respect to the income and assets of its subsidiaries, either: (i)&nbsp;at least 75% of its gross income is &#147;passive income&#148; or (ii)&nbsp;at least 50% of the average quarterly value of its
	total gross assets (which, assuming we are not a CFC for the year being test, would be measured by fair market value of the assets, and for which purpose the total value of our assets may be determined in part by the market value of our ordinary
	shares, which is subject to change) is attributable to assets that produce &#147;passive income&#148; or are held for the production of &#147;passive income.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, gains from commodities and securities transactions, the excess of
	gains over losses from the disposition of assets which produce passive income, and includes amounts derived by reason of the temporary investment of funds raised in offerings of our ordinary shares. If a non-U.S. corporation owns directly or
	indirectly at least 25% by value of the stock of another corporation, the non-U.S. corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation and as receiving directly its
	proportionate share of the other corporation&#146;s income. If we are classified as a PFIC in any year with respect to which a U.S. holder owns our ordinary shares, we will continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. holder in all
	succeeding years during which the U.S. holder owns our ordinary shares, regardless of whether we continue to meet the tests described above.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although the
	matter is not free from doubt, we believe that we were not a PFIC during our 2015 taxable year. Our status for any taxable year will depend on our assets and activities in each year, and because this is a factual determination made annually after
	the end of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for the current taxable year or any future taxable year. The market value of our assets may be determined in large part by reference to the market price of
	our ordinary shares, which is likely to fluctuate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If we are a PFIC, and you are a U.S. holder, then unless you make one of the elections described
	below, a special tax regime will apply to both (a)&nbsp;any &#147;excess distribution&#148; by us to you (generally, your ratable portion of distributions in any year which are greater than 125% of the average annual distribution received by you in
	the shorter of the three preceding years or your holding period for our ordinary shares) and (b)&nbsp;any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares. Under this regime, any excess distribution and realized gain will be
	treated as ordinary income and will be subject to tax as if (a)&nbsp;the excess distribution or gain had been realized ratably over your holding period, (b)&nbsp;the amount deemed realized in each year had been subject to tax in each year of that
	holding period at the highest marginal rate for such year (other than income allocated to the current period or any taxable period before we became a PFIC, which would be subject to tax at the U.S. holder&#146;s regular ordinary income rate for the
	current year and would not be subject to the interest charge discussed below), and (c)&nbsp;the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax had been imposed on the taxes deemed to have been payable in those years. In addition,
	dividend distributions made to you will not qualify for the lower rates of taxation applicable to long-term capital gains discussed above under &#147;Distributions.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Certain elections exist that may alleviate some of the adverse consequences of PFIC status and would result in an alternative treatment (such as
	mark-to-market treatment) of our ordinary shares. If a U.S. holder makes the mark-to-market election, the U.S. holder generally will recognize as ordinary income any excess of the fair market value of the ordinary shares at the end of each taxable
	year over their adjusted tax basis, and will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of any excess of the adjusted tax basis of the ordinary shares over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount
	of income previously included as a result of the mark-to-market election). If a U.S. holder makes the election, the U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in the ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect these income or loss amounts. Any gain recognized on
	the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as an ordinary loss (but only to the extent of the net amount of income previously included as a result of
	the mark-to-market election). The mark-to-market election is available only if we are a PFIC and our ordinary shares are &#147;regularly traded&#148; on a &#147;qualified exchange.&#148; Our ordinary shares will be treated as &#147;regularly
	traded&#148; in any calendar year in which more than a de minimis quantity of the ordinary shares are traded on a qualified exchange on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter (subject to the rule that trades that have as one of their
	principle purposes the meeting of the trading requirement as disregarded). The NASDAQ Global Market is a qualified exchange for this purpose and, consequently, if the ordinary shares are regularly traded, the mark-to-market election will be
	available to a U.S. holder.

	We do not currently intend to provide the information necessary for U.S. holders to make qualified electing fund elections if
	we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine whether any of these elections would be available and if so, what the consequences of the alternative treatments would be in their particular
	circumstances.

	If a U.S. holder owns ordinary shares during any taxable year in which we are a PFIC and the U.S. holder recognizes gain on a disposition of our ordinary

	We are exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our cash management policy is focused on optimizing the net interest result of funds invested in deposits while accepting limited risk (minimum ratings of P2
	or A3 for short-term and long-term, respectively by Moody&#146;s and A2 or A-&nbsp;for short-term and long-term, respectively, by Standard and Poor&#146;s). Individual commitments exceeding a defined threshold in foreign currencies may be hedged

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, primarily with
	respect to the U.S. Dollar. We have exposure associated with the time delay between entering into a contract, budget or forecast and the realization thereof. To minimize economic exposure related to currency fluctuations, currencies on the balance
	sheet will be matched to the cash flows on an annual basis to ensure the availability of at least 12 months of liquidity per currency per the approved budget. The impact of fair value measurements on the financial statements is limited.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At December&nbsp;31, 2015 there was a net liability in U.S. Dollars of &#128; 1.1&nbsp;million (2014: &#128; 0.7 million). Foreign currency denominated
	receivables and trade payables are short term in nature (generally 30 to 45 days). As a result foreign exchange rate movements on receivables and trade payables, during the years presented had an immaterial effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our interest rate risk exposure is limited due to the use of loans with fixed rates. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had one loan and a financial lease with
	fixed interest, totaling &#128; 4,839,000 (2014: &#128; 2,863,000).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Credit risk represents the risk of financial loss caused by default of the counterparty. We have no large receivables balances with external parties. Our
	principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents which are, in line with our cash policy, placed at ABN Amro and Rabobank which meet our defined minimum credit ratings.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of ProQR Therapeutics N.V. (&#147;the Company&#148;) as of December 31, 2015
	and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 (further the &#147;financial statements&#148;). These financial statements
	are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
	are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
	basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
	opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ProQR Therapeutics N.V. as at December 31, 2015
	and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Initially, the Company&#146;s ordinary shares were not publicly traded and consequently the Company needed to estimate the fair value of its share and the

	estimates are further discussed in Note 12(e) to the financial statements. The value of the underlying shares was determined on the basis of the prior sale of company stock method. As such, the Company has benchmarked the value per share to external

	Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, primarily with respect to the
	U.S. Dollar. The Company has an exposure associated with the time delay between entering into a contract, budget or forecast and the realization thereof. The Company operates a foreign exchange policy to manage the foreign exchange risk against the
	functional currency based on the Company&#146;s cash balances and the projected future spend per major currency.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015 there was a
	net liability in U.S. Dollars of &#128; 1.1&nbsp;million (2014: &#128; 0.7 million). Foreign currency denominated receivables and trade payables are short term in nature (generally 30 to 45 days). As a result foreign exchange rate movements on
	receivables and trade payables, during the years presented had an immaterial effect on the financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At year-end, a substantial amount of our

	A reasonably possible
	strengthening (weakening) of the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar by 10% against all other currencies at December&nbsp;31 would have affected the measurement of our cash balances denominated in a U.S.&nbsp;Dollar and affected equity and profit or loss by &#128;
	5.2&nbsp;million (2014: &#128; 4.3 million). The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.

	The market prices for the production of preclinical and clinical materials and services as well as external contracted research may vary over time. Currently,

	The Company&#146;s exposure to interest rate risks is limited due to the use of loans with fixed rates. The Company has one loan and a financial lease with a
	fixed interest, totaling &#128; 4,839,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2015 (2014: &#128; 2,863,000). Details on the interest rates and maturities of these loans are provided in Note 13.

	Credit risk represents the risk of

	cash management policy is focused on preserving capital, providing liquidity for operations and optimizing yield while accepting limited risk (Short-term credit ratings must be rated A-1/P-1/F1 at a minimum by at least one of the Nationally
	Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs) specifically Moody&#146;s, Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor&#146;s or Fitch. Long-term credit rating must be rated A- or A3 at a minimum by at least one NRSRO).

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents were placed at two large institutions, Rabobank
	and ABN Amro. Both institutions are highly rated (ratings of Aa2 and A2 respectively) with sufficient capital adequacy and liquidity metrics.

	Liquidity risk represents the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. Prudent liquidity
	risk management implies ensuring sufficient availability of cash resources for funding of operations and planning to raise cash if and when needed, either through issue of shares or through credit facilities. Management monitors rolling forecasts of
	the Company&#146;s liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flow.
