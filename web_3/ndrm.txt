	translated using historical exchange rates (as reported by the Bank of Israel). All other statements of financial position accounts
	are translated using the year-end exchange rate (as reported by the Bank of Israel). Statement of comprehensive loss amounts are
	translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The resulting translation differences relating

	Effective
	January 1, 2016, we determined that our functional currency changed to U.S. dollars. This determination resulted from a
	change in relevant circumstances of which, based on our level of spending on research and development expenses (mainly
	related to advanced clinical trials) and other operating expenses, we concluded that most of our spending for 2016 and
	thereafter will be in U.S. dollars. In addition, our financing is anticipated to continue to be in U.S. dollars. As we do
	not foresee a reversal of this trend, we transitioned the functional currency to the U.S. dollar effective January 1, 2016.
	The effect of the change in functional currency will be accounted for prospectively.

	We are a clinical-stage
	pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We recently completed a Phase II clinical study for ND0612L and a
	Phase IIa clinical trial for ND0612H and ND0612L in Israel. We have begun patient enrollment for a Phase II clinical efficacy
	trial for ND0612H, are currently running a pharmacokinetic study for ND0612H in the EU and are planning to initiate a long
	term safety trial for ND0612 in the second quarter of 2016 and a Phase III pivotal efficacy trial for ND0612L around
	mid-2016. We are also planning further clinical studies for those product candidates and our other product candidates, ND0701
	and ND0801. Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront
	capital expenditures and significant risks that any or all potential product candidates will fail to demonstrate adequate
	effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved
	for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant
	research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We are still in the early stages of
	development of our product candidates. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred significant operating
	losses, including operating losses of $3.2 million, $13.4 million and $18.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013,
	2014 and 2015, respectively.

	We are conducting clinical trials

	caused by our product candidates and their convenience is limited. Some of our patients have only used our product candidates
	for 24-hour periods during our clinical trials. Based on the results of our recently completed Phase II and Phase IIa
	studies, we believe that ND0612H and ND0612L were generally well tolerated and safe, causing only minimal and transient local
	reactions at the infusion site and no particular systemic adverse events. Patients may decide to use other currently
	available treatments instead of our product candidates based on the prevalence and severity of any side effects associated
	with our product candidates. For example, patients suffering from moderate Parkinson&rsquo;s disease may be less tolerant of
	inconveniences that may be associated with the use of ND0612L and may instead continue using currently available orally
	administered LD/CD. Similarly, if patients experience adverse side effects from our other Parkinson&rsquo;s disease product

	Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions,
	including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs.
	Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for
	which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions,
	precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period or
	precludes the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and other national drug regulators in the EU, from accepting another marketing
	application for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. The applicable market exclusivity period is seven years in
	the United States and 10 years in the European Union. See &ldquo;ITEM 4. Information on the Company&mdash;B. Business&nbsp;Overview&mdash;Government
	Regulation&mdash;United States&mdash;Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity&rdquo; and &ldquo;ITEM 4. Information on the Company&mdash;B.

	we do and if the competitor&rsquo;s product is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as ours, we could be excluded from
	the market during the market exclusivity period. However, if a product candidate that is the same drug or a similar medicinal product
	as an approved, orphan-designated product is shown to be clinically superior (by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety,
	or that it provides a major contribution to patient care) to such orphan-designated product, the orphan drug exclusivity will not
	block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity will not prevent the approval of a product
	candidate that is the same drug as such orphan-designated product if the FDA or EMA finds that the product sponsor or marketing
	authorization holder cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan-designated product to meet the needs
	of the persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.

	we establish a trials framework that would allow a 505(b)(2) submission. On May 22, 2014, the EMA confirmed that our product candidate,

	conducting a bioequivalence clinical trial to compare the pharmacokinetics of the continuous infusion of ND0612H with that of Duodopa;
	however, the EMA or other national drug regulators in the EU might require that we conduct additional clinical trials. Additionally,

	For example, in June 2014, the FDA
	placed a hold on the U.S. clinical development of ND0612H and ND0612L, requesting additional information on the accuracy,
	safety, and compatibility of the devices used to deliver the drug. We subsequently completed the required compatibility study
	and submitted the requested additional information to the FDA. In May 2015, the FDA lifted the clinical hold and our U.S.
	clinical development program was cleared to proceed, with several studies accordingly commencing in late 2015 and early 2016.
	Additionally, in July 2015, the FDA issued a warning letter to Cane S.p.A., our supplier of the delivery devices used in the
	clinical trials of both ND0612L and ND0612H, requesting that it provide additional documentation pertaining to good
	manufacturing practices of the Quality System regulation. Until documentation is provided to the satisfaction of the FDA,
	Cane may not import devices into the United States. This does not preclude the sale or use of devices currently in the United
	States nor the importation of devices for investigational purposes if approved as part of an investigational study. Although
	we have not experienced other risks involved with conducting clinical trials, including increased expense and delay, to date,
	there can be no assurance that we will not experience delays or such risks in the future as we progress with our planned
	clinical trials. Any delay in receiving regulatory clearance to commence our clinical trials or any suspension of clinical
	trials may delay possible regulatory approval, if any, and adversely impact our ability to develop products and generate
	revenue.

	We are required to apply for and receive

	safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, control of product
	development, proposed labeling and other additional information. Before marketing authorization is granted, regulatory authorities
	generally require the inspection of manufacturing facilities and quality systems of our third-party manufacturers at which the

	regulatory authorities may change or may not be explicit, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent,

	to established regulations or to meet a specification or procedure set forth in cGMP requirements could require that a product
	or material be rejected and destroyed. Adherence to cGMP regulations and the effectiveness of our quality control systems are periodically

	If critical deficiencies are noted or if recurrences are not prevented, we may have to recall products or suspend operations until
	appropriate measures are implemented. Since cGMP reflects ever-evolving standards, manufacturing processes and procedures must
	be regularly updated to comply with cGMP. These changes may cause us to incur additional costs and may adversely impact our results

	The FDA and other regulatory agencies

	in the product candidates resulting from the change in the manufacturing process. If we were to change manufacturers of our drug
	substances or our devices during or after the clinical trials and regulatory approval process for ND0612L or any of our other product

	The patent landscape in the pharmaceutical
	and biotechnology fields is highly uncertain and involves complex legal, factual and scientific questions, and changes in either
	patent laws or in the interpretation of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value and strength
	of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Effective protection of our intellectual property rights
	may also be unavailable or limited in some countries, and even if available, we may fail to pursue or obtain necessary intellectual
	property protection in such countries because filing, prosecuting, maintaining and defending patents on product candidates in all
	countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. In addition, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly
	of certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights, and
	the laws of foreign countries do not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, our intellectual
	property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.
	Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products,
	and we may be unable to prevent those competitors from importing those infringing products into territories where we have patent
	protection but enforcement is not as strong as in the United States or into jurisdictions in which we do not have patent protection.
	These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents and other intellectual property rights may not be effective
	or sufficient to prevent them from competing in those jurisdictions. Moreover, competitors or others in the chain of commerce may
	raise legal challenges against our intellectual property rights or may infringe upon our intellectual property rights, including
	through means that may be difficult to prevent or detect.

	We rely on proprietary information (such

	believe is best protected by means that do not require public disclosure. We generally seek to protect this proprietary information
	by entering into confidentiality agreements, or consulting, services or employment agreements that contain non-disclosure and non-use
	provisions with our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific advisors and third parties. However, we may fail to enter into
	the necessary agreements, and even if entered into, these agreements may be breached or otherwise fail to prevent disclosure, third-party
	infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary information, may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate
	remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. We have limited control over the protection of
	trade secrets used by our suppliers, manufacturers and service providers and could lose future trade secret protection if any unauthorized
	disclosure of such information occurs. In addition, our proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently
	developed by our competitors or other third parties. To the extent that our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific advisors
	and other third parties use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in
	related or resulting know-how and inventions. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine
	the scope of our and relevant third parties&rsquo; proprietary rights, failure to obtain or maintain protection for our proprietary
	information could adversely affect our competitive business position and if third parties are able to establish that we are using
	their proprietary information without their permission, we may be required to obtain a license to that information, or if such
	a license is not available, re-design our products to avoid any such unauthorized use or temporarily delay or permanently stop
	manufacturing or sales of the affected products. Furthermore, laws regarding trade secret rights in certain markets where we operate

	that the permissible use of those marks will not be limited in scope. For example, the USPTO has informed us that a third
	party has a prior trademark registration for &ldquo;neuroderm&rdquo; classified in the same class of goods as our product
	candidates. While we believe that our product candidates under this trademark are different from the products of such third
	party and unlikely to cause any confusion, we cannot guarantee the USPTO will withdraw the citation of such prior trademark.
	Consequently, we might not be able to secure trademark registration for &ldquo;NeuroDerm&rdquo; in the United States. In
	addition, in the USPTO or its foreign counterparts, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark
	applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our

	an acquired company&rsquo;s personnel, operations, technology or product offerings into our own or in retaining and motivating
	key personnel from these businesses. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities. The financing of any such acquisition or investment,
	or of a significant general expansion of our business, may not be readily available on favorable terms. Any significant acquisition
	or investment, or major expansion of our business, may require us to explore external financing sources, such as an offering of
	our equity or debt securities. We cannot be certain that these financing sources will be available to us or that we will be able
	to negotiate commercially reasonable terms for any such financing, or that our actual cash requirements for an acquisition, investment
	or expansion will not be greater than anticipated. In addition, any indebtedness that we may incur in such a financing may inhibit
	our operational freedom, while any equity securities that we may issue in connection with such a financing would dilute our shareholders.

	Through December 31, 2015, our functional
	currency was the NIS but our presentation currency was and remains the U.S. dollar. Even after we transitioned to the U.S. dollar
	as our functional currency effective as of January 1, 2016, a significant portion of our operating expenses are expected to continue
	to be incurred in NIS. The portion of our expenses that have been denominated in U.S. dollars has accounted for 6.0%, 16.0% and
	38.0% of our expenses in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. As a result, we are exposed to the risks
	that the shekel may appreciate relative to the dollar, or, if the shekel instead devalues relative to the dollar, that the inflation
	rate in Israel may exceed such rate of devaluation of the shekel, or that the timing of such devaluation may lag behind inflation
	in Israel. In any such event, the dollar cost of our operations in Israel would increase and our dollar-denominated results of
	operations would be adversely affected. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation in Israel or the rate of devaluation
	(if any) of the shekel against the dollar. For example, the dollar depreciated relative to the shekel by 7.0% in 2013, which was
	compounded by inflation in Israel at a rate of 1.9%. That had the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in Israel
	by 8.9% in that year. While the dollar appreciated relative to the shekel by 12.0% in 2014 and 0.3% in 2015, respectively, eclipsing
	the 0.5% rate of inflation in 2014 and compounding the negative rate of inflation (-1.0%) in Israel in 2015, there is no guarantee
	that the prior trend of dollar devaluation relative to the shekel will not return in the future. If the dollar cost of our operations
	in Israel increases, our dollar-measured results of operations will be adversely affected. Our operations also could be adversely
	affected if we are unable to effectively hedge against currency fluctuations in the future.

	Strip) and other Palestinian Arab groups, has led to Israeli military campaigns in Gaza in December 2008, in November 2012 and
	from July through August 2014, in an endeavor to prevent continued rocket attacks in Israel&rsquo;s southern and central regions.
	In addition, Israel faces threats from more distant neighbors, in particular, Iran, an ally of Hezbollah and Hamas, which has threatened

	hostile to Israel, such as the Syrian government, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

	Recent political uprisings, social unrest
	and violence in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Israel&rsquo;s neighbors Egypt and Syria are affecting
	the political stability of those countries. This instability may lead to deterioration in the political and trade relationships
	that exist between the State of Israel and these countries and have raised concerns regarding security in the region and the potential
	for armed conflict. Furthermore, several countries, principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli
	companies, and additional countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies if hostilities
	in the region continue or intensify. Such restrictions may seriously limit our ability to sell our products to customers in those
	countries. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading
	partners, or significant downturns in the economic or financial condition of Israel, could materially and adversely affect our
	operations and product development, detrimentally affect our potential to generate revenues and adversely affect the share price
	of publicly traded companies having operations in Israel, such as us. Similarly, Israeli corporations are limited in conducting
	business with entities from several countries. For example, in 2008, the Israeli legislator enacted a law forbidding any investments
	in entities that transact business with Iran.

	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical
	company developing next-generation treatments for central nervous system, or CNS, disorders through proprietary formulations based
	on existing drugs that are intended to make a significant difference in patients&rsquo; lives. Product candidates in our pipeline
	are designed to overcome major deficiencies of current treatments and achieve enhanced clinical efficacy through continuous, controlled
	administration, primarily subcutaneously or transdermally. Additionally, because our product candidates are based on reformulations
	of leading, approved drugs, we believe that most of them qualify for an accelerated, lower risk regulatory pathway to marketing
	approval.

	For moderate to severe Parkinson&rsquo;s
	disease, our product candidates are aimed at overcoming the most significant limitations of current levodopa-carbidopa, or LD/CD,
	therapy. For over 30 years, oral administration of LD/CD has been the standard of care for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. However,
	despite its widespread acceptance, oral LD/CD has significant limitations, primarily short duration in the blood, or half-life,
	as well as low absorption and availability in the body. As a result, plasma levodopa concentrations fluctuate sharply, contributing
	to patients&rsquo; motor complications. At the advanced stages of the disease, patients do not respond to oral administration of
	LD/CD, motor complications are exacerbated and patients are left with limited treatment options that are highly invasive and/or
	burdensome. We have developed liquid formulations, such as our product candidates ND0612H and ND0612L, that for the first time
	enable 24-hour, continuous subcutaneous administration of LD/CD to overcome these limitations, maintain steady levodopa levels
	and offer patients a better quality of life without the need for surgery.

	There are three main stages
	to Parkinson&rsquo;s disease: mild, moderate and severe, each associated with increasing levels of motor complications and requiring
	different treatments. We are developing a pipeline of product candidates for the growing population of moderate and severe Parkinson&rsquo;s
	disease patients that address the deficiencies of current treatments. These product candidates are designed to administer continuous,
	controlled doses of LD/CD or apomorphine, utilizing customized versions of off-the-shelf, belt pump devices. We are also developing
	a product candidate for patients suffering from cognition disorders associated with CNS diseases. These diseases include Attention
	Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADD/ADHD, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and
	schizophrenia. Our cognition product candidate is based on a combination of reformulated approved drugs allowing for continuous
	administration via transdermal patches.

	In our completed Phase IIa
	dose-finding trial, we examined the plasma levodopa concentrations achieved in individual Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients treated
	with ND0612H and ND0612L for eight hours. The chart below shows that ND0612H achieved an average maximum plasma levodopa concentration
	of approximately 1500ng/ml when administered alone and an average maximum plasma levodopa concentration of approximately 1800ng/ml
	when combined with two administrations of oral entacapone during eight hours of infusion. The high average plasma levodopa concentrations
	achieved with ND0612H in this trial indicate that ND0612H may offer a viable nonsurgical alternative to more invasive surgical
	procedures for advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease.

	the effect of ND0612L without the standard of care, we conducted an additional week of treatment of ND0612L alone or with entacapone.
	The chart below shows that an average steady plasma levodopa concentration of 550ng/ml was maintained when ND0612L was administered
	alone, and an approximately 800ng/ml plasma levodopa concentration was maintained when ND0612L was administered together with thrice-daily

	Parkinson&rsquo;s disease
	is a progressive neurodegenerative illness characterized by reduced dopamine levels in the brain, resulting in a debilitating decrease
	in the patient&rsquo;s motor and non-motor functions. Its symptoms, such as trembling in the extremities and face, slowness of
	movement and impaired balance and coordination, worsen over time and gravely impact the patient&rsquo;s quality of life. As the
	disease progresses, these symptoms become more severe and complications of treatment become more pronounced, resulting in debilitating
	periods of decreased motor and non-motor functions, also referred to as &ldquo;off&rdquo; time. In addition, patients experience
	dyskinesia, which is typically associated with excessive levodopa doses. The &ldquo;off&rdquo; time and dyskinesia affect the majority
	of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients and interfere with day-to-day functions, causing patients to become severely disabled. Two
	to five years from disease diagnosis, patients can go from &ldquo;on&rdquo; to &ldquo;off&rdquo; in a rapid and sometimes erratic
	manner and experience an average of six hours of &ldquo;off&rdquo; time at various and unpredictable times throughout the day.
	In the most severe stage of the disease, patients may become bedridden or require a wheelchair, as oral therapy becomes mostly
	ineffective.

	Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society, the prevalence of diagnosed patients with the disease will likely double from 2010 to
	2040 due to increased life expectancy. Additionally, it estimates that Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients in the United States
	spent over $14 billion on medical expenses in 2010. According to GlobalData Ltd., the global Parkinson&rsquo;s disease drug market
	was approximately $3.3&nbsp;billion in 2010. According to the Michael Stern Parkinson&rsquo;s Research Foundation, drugs used to
	treat Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients can cost up to $6,000 a year in the United States. First year surgery and devices for

	Oral administration of LD/CD
	is regarded as the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; treatment for patients suffering from Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. Levodopa is a therapy
	that complements dopamine levels in the brain that decrease due to degeneration of dopamine producing brain cells. Whenever complementation
	therapy is possible, it often becomes a &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; therapy. Virtually all patients diagnosed with Parkinson&rsquo;s
	disease will require levodopa at some point over the course of their treatment for the disease, and 70% to 80% of patients receive
	the drug at any given point in time. When LD/CD is taken orally, levodopa crosses into the brain through the &ldquo;blood-brain
	barrier&rdquo; and is converted into dopamine. The resulting increase in the brain&rsquo;s dopamine concentration improves nerve
	conductivity and helps control the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. The addition of carbidopa allows lower
	doses of levodopa to be used by preventing the breakdown of levodopa into dopamine before levodopa crosses into the brain.

	One major limitation of oral
	administration of LD/CD is that it results in highly variable and fluctuating levels of levodopa in the plasma. When LD/CD is administered
	orally, levodopa is absorbed actively through amino acid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and competes for necessary receptors
	with amino acids from food and from carbidopa. Therefore, the absorption of levodopa is erratic and its bioavailability is relatively
	low. Only 30% of it enters the blood stream; thus, by the time the levodopa reaches the brain, it has a significantly reduced drug
	concentration than when it was administered. In addition, levodopa is also known for its short half-life of approximately 50 to
	90 minutes, which means that approximately three to four hours after a single dose, almost none of the drug remains in the plasma.
	Due to the short half-life, patients are required to take multiple LD/CD doses daily. This results in sharp fluctuations in levodopa
	levels, which in turn causes concomitant sharp fluctuations in brain-dopamine levels shortly after oral levodopa ingestion. When
	brain-dopamine levels are excessive, motor complications, such as dyskinesia, occur. Such motor complications occur at increasing
	levels as the disease progresses: 20% of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients develop motor complications and &ldquo;off time&rdquo;
	within six months of diagnosis, 50% after 18&nbsp;months and almost all patients suffer from motor complications, with up to six
	hours of &ldquo;off&rdquo; time within two to five years. The fluctuations in brain-dopamine levels due to the oral administration
	of levodopa result in the erratic &ldquo;off&rdquo; and &ldquo;on&rdquo; periods shown in the figure below. This figure also demonstrates
	the narrowing of the therapeutic window over time, i.e. higher doses are needed to turn a patient &ldquo;on&rdquo; but may also
	cause dyskinesia.

	Early-stage patients who suffer
	from mild Parkinson&rsquo;s disease may experience shaking in the hands or fingers, slowness in movement and stiffness in the muscles.
	In this stage of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, the brain still produces some base level of dopamine. Such patients are generally treated
	with one or more of these forms of treatment: oral drugs (delivered in the form of pills) such as MAO inhibitors, which help block
	the breakdown of dopamine in the brain; dopamine agonists (most of which are oral drugs), which activate dopamine receptors; or
	relatively low-dose LD/CD complementation therapy. Oral drugs are effective in reducing motor symptoms associated with mild Parkinson&rsquo;s
	disease. However, as the disease progresses, such drugs provide only modest symptomatic improvements and additional therapeutic
	approaches are needed, mainly consisting of higher doses of LD/CD.

	Within two to five years from
	the diagnosis of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, the disease progresses to the moderate stage when, despite optimized LD/CD therapy,
	patients develop motor complications, i.e., more frequent daily &ldquo;off&rdquo; time causing limited mobility. At this stage
	of the disease, performing normal physical tasks becomes more difficult for such patients due to increased &ldquo;off&rdquo; time
	and dyskinesia. In addition, patients at this stage begin to suffer from morning akinesia. Patients with moderate Parkinson&rsquo;s
	disease are dependent on, and typically treated with, high doses of LD/CD. For example, patients may receive extended-release tablets
	of dopamine agonists in order to treat the symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. One such extended-release tablet, Mirapex ER,

	As the Parkinson&rsquo;s disease
	progresses to the severe stage, patients&rsquo; therapeutic window narrows. Patients in this stage experience extended &ldquo;off&rdquo;
	time and, as a result of frequent doses of LD/CD, frequent and severe dyskinesia, causing a small subset of these patients to become
	bedridden or require a wheelchair. Over time, patients who have not adequately responded to oral LD/CD therapy must either live
	with such conditions or undergo invasive surgical procedures to try to control or minimize motor complications. The primary existing
	treatments for patients who suffer from severe Parkinson&rsquo;s disease require surgical intervention. These include deep brain
	stimulation, or DBS, which involves inserting electrodes into the brain, or LCIG, which requires gastrointestinal surgery. We estimate
	that approximately 700,000 patients who suffer from severe Parkinson&rsquo;s disease globally do not receive such advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s

	According to Transparency Market Research,
	the 2012 global DBS device market size for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, excluding surgical costs, was approximately $500&nbsp;million.
	DBS is a highly invasive procedure that involves open-brain surgery with local anesthesia applied to numb the scalp, during which
	electrodes are implanted into the brain and connected to a small electrical pulse generator that can be externally programmed.
	Once in place, electrical impulses are sent from the device to the brain. These impulses block the electrical signals that cause
	tremors and other Parkinson&rsquo;s disease symptoms. Studies have shown that DBS is effective in reducing tremors, stiffness,
	some walking problems and other movement-interfering symptoms in patients who undergo the DBS procedure. Nonetheless, DBS involves
	extreme risks, including coma, seizures, speech loss, cognitive deficits, infection and bleeding in the brain, which can cause
	stroke-like symptoms. Patients who undergo DBS are also required to have additional surgeries every three to five years in order
	to replace the battery. The complexity and related risks of this invasive procedure preclude physicians from referring older patients,
	and nearly 52% of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients who receive referrals to undergo this procedure are turned down. According
	to a 2012 study by the Association of American Medical Colleges, there are approximately 14,000 neurologists and geriatricians
	in the United States and, based on a an article titled &ldquo;Neurology Residency Training in Europe&mdash;the Current Situation&rdquo;
	in the April 2011 issue of the European Journal of Neurology along with publicly available data from the British Geriatrics Society,
	we estimate that there are approximately 35,000 neurologists and geriatricians in Europe, in each case, that we believe may treat
	patients who suffer from moderate Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. We further believe, based on information from leading physicians,
	that there are an estimated 1,500 physicians in each of the United States and Europe that may treat patients who suffer from severe
	Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.

	Similarly, Duodopa, which
	had sales of $231 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, is a high dose LCIG product that was recently approved in the United
	States under the name Duopa. Duodopa is administered into the duodenum via a permanent tube that is surgically inserted into the
	duodenum. Surgery for treatment with Duodopa involves general anesthesia and significant costs requiring gastrointestinal surgery.
	Patients receiving this form of treatment face potential complications, such as connector leakage, dislocation or movement of the
	intestinal tube, wound infection or peritonitis. In addition, patients must continuously carry a large, bulky shoulder-worn pump
	attached to their duodenum during the day. Duodopa is designed for continuous 16-hour administration of a gel form of high-dose
	LD/CD. Patients usually remove the pump at night, which affects quality of sleep and results in morning akinesia. Such complications
	and restrictions acutely limit the patients' day-to-day activities and prevent many of the patients from having this treatment.

	subcutaneously to such patients for a 24-hour period via the CRONO ND belt pump (described below). ND0612L is designed to
	administer approximately 40% of the maximum daily levodopa dosage delivered by ND0612H. By maintaining a steady minimum
	plasma levodopa concentration of between approximately 550 to 800&nbsp;ng/ml, we aim to reduce dyskinesia and
	&ldquo;off&rdquo; periods and to improve sleep quality. In addition, we are designing ND0612L to allow patients to receive
	LD/CD overnight. We expect that ND0612L will serve as a second-line therapy for patients suffering from moderate
	Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and may be used as an adjunct or mono-therapy. Depending on the results of our clinical trials and
	the regulatory approval process, we expect to receive marketing approval in the United States and Europe for ND0612L in the
	second half of 2018. We are also working with our third-party medical device manufacturers on a smaller, next-generation
	patch-pump device for use with ND0612L in the future.

	CRONO ND is a simple-to-operate, fixed-dose belt pump that operates 24 hours a day and can be preprogrammed
	to the desired delivery profile of LD/CD. This device is used to administer our ND0612L and ND0701 drug formulations. CRONO ND
	consists of two parts: a preprogrammed pump device that regulates the delivery rate of the drug, and a single-use, disposable cartridge,
	which holds our liquid reformulation of LD/CD and which is connected to an infusion tube. For ND0612L, the CRONO ND infusion tube
	is attached to a small disposable cannula, or flexible needle, positioned to subcutaneously deliver 4.5ml of LD/CD to the patient
	per day. The disposable cartridge and the infusion set are discarded and replaced by the patient daily.

	Second-Generation Patch Pump.

	We have engaged third-party firms to design and eventually manufacture a patch pump that
	will be used for the administration of ND0612L and ND0701. The patch pump would be worn directly on the skin underneath a patient's

	ratio) to receive as an add-on a subcutaneous infusion of either ND0612L or placebo for 14&nbsp;days. After 14&nbsp;days, according
	to the protocol, 16 patients were offered an additional week of treatment, in which they were randomized to receive either ND0612L
	alone or ND0612L with oral entacapone, in each case, without the patient&rsquo;s standard of care.

	All parameters, including

	groups. Additionally, exploratory efficacy end points, including daily duration of &ldquo;off&rdquo; time, &ldquo;on&rdquo; time
	(with and without troublesome dyskinesia), quality of sleep, quality of life and disease improvement were assessed in the clinic
	and reported in subjective home diaries. Eligible patients included male or female individuals with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease,
	experiencing motor fluctuations averaging more than two hours of &ldquo;off&rdquo; time per day on optimized levodopa treatment
	and, if necessary, additional Parkinson&rsquo;s disease drugs. Patients treated with controlled-release levodopa formulations who

	Treatment with ND0612L resulted
	in a clinically significant reduction in fluctuations of plasma levodopa concentrations when compared to the placebo. In the group
	treated with ND0612L, plasma levodopa concentrations were relatively stable and were maintained above an average minimum of approximately
	800ng/ml, avoiding the low trough concentrations observed in the placebo group (approximately 180ng/ml), as shown in the chart
	below. Compared to the placebo, ND0612L also demonstrated a markedly reduced peak-to-trough ratio, which measures the maximum concentration

	Treatment with ND0612L and ND0612H did not
	raise safety and tolerability concerns, causing only minimal and transient local reactions at the infusion site and no particular
	systemic adverse events, which corroborates the results obtained in previous studies. We believe these results suggest that ND0612H
	could provide an effective treatment option for the majority of advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients that are considering
	or are currently treated with DBS or Duodopa.

	On April 10, 2012, we held
	a pre-IND meeting with the FDA. In this meeting, the FDA stated that ND0612L was eligible for the submission of a 505(b)(2) regulatory
	pathway application, which allows expedited regulatory development. See &ldquo;Business&nbsp;Overview&mdash;Government Regulation&mdash;United
	States&mdash;Section 505(b)(2) NDAs.&rdquo; The FDA also provided a clinical trials framework that would allow a 505(b)(2)
	submission for ND0612L based on two large efficacy studies. In November 2015, we initiated and held a Type C meeting with the FDA.
	As a result of this meeting, our development plan was modified and shortened. For the ND0612L program, the FDA agreed that the
	file submission of ND0612L will be based only on one pivotal efficacy study, and not two studies as originally planned. The pivotal
	study will be of the same design, treatment duration and patient number as originally planned, which aligns with our development
	plan for the EU. According to our agreement with the FDA, the safety follow up study of both ND0612H and ND0612L will include at
	least 100 patients treated for one year of whom at least half will receive the maximum dose. We intend to have similar discussions
	with the EMA about our product candidates in order to expedite the marketing approval process in Europe.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to initiate a replacement Phase III multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy placebo-controlled randomized study of approximately 80 patients suffering from severe Parkinson's disease.

Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio of ND0612H to standard oral LD/CD administration with both groups titrated to an optimal state. Subjects will be treated for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint is the reduction of &ldquo;off&rdquo; time, while the secondary endpoint is troublesome dyskinesia. Exploratory endpoints are an assessment of the effect of ND0612H's continuous infusion on non-motor features.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;We plan to initiate a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study of 200 to 240 subjects with Parkinson's disease, who experience at least two hours of &ldquo;off&rdquo; time per day. We expect this study to commence in the mid-2016. The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of one or two doses of ND0612L in patients suffering from moderate to severe Parkinson's disease. Subjects will be treated for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint is the reduction of &ldquo;off&rdquo; time. The co-secondary endpoints are the effect on dyskinesia and quality of life. Additional exploratory endpoints include non-motor functions.

	We are also developing a product candidate,
	ND0801, to treat cognition disorders associated with CNS diseases, such as ADD/ADHD, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Cognition
	refers to mental processes and brain functions that involve one's ability to learn, understand and remember information; to organize,
	plan and problem-solve; to focus, maintain and shift attention; and to understand and use language. The therapeutic drugs most
	commonly used to treat the symptoms associated with ADD/ADHD are stimulants, such as Ritalin and Adderall, which have significant
	abuse and misuse potential because their use is associated with severe psychological or physical dependence. Non-stimulant drugs
	may also be prescribed to treat the symptoms associated with ADD/ADHD, although the significant side effects of such drugs, including
	fatigue, decreased appetite, sexual problems, palpitations, increased heart rate and high blood pressure, have limited their use.

	We have conducted preclinical studies to examine
	the effect of opipramol on nicotine addiction in animals. In one such study, we tested the effect of opripramol on the withdrawal
	symptoms associated with nicotine in animal models. This study consisted of eight separate groups with either six or seven subjects
	per group: group 1 received a saline solution for nine days and served as the control group; group 2 received nicotine for seven
	days; groups 3 and 4 received opripramol for ten days; groups 5 and 6 received opripramol and nicotine for seven days and just
	opripramol one day prior and one day after co-administration with nicotine; and groups 7 and 8 received nicotine for seven days
	and opripramol on the eighth day. Per our examination of the subjects following the end of nicotine administration, we determined
	that daily oral administration of opipramol with nicotine materially reduces the occurrence of nicotine withdrawal symptoms 23&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;24
	hours after ceasing nicotine administration. In another preclinical study, we injected nicotine into rats, which produced a typical
	1.5 degree reduction in the rats' body temperature. Following controlled, repeated injections, the effect of nicotine on the rats'
	body temperature was significantly reduced overtime. In contrast, repeated injections of a combination of nicotine and opipramol
	maintained nicotine's effect on body temperature.

	While our policy is to obtain
	patents by application, license or otherwise, to maintain trade secrets and to seek to operate without infringing on the intellectual
	property rights of third parties, technologies related to our business have been rapidly developing in recent years. Loss or invalidation
	of certain of our patents, or a finding of unenforceability or limited scope of certain of our intellectual property, could have
	a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result
	in the issuance of patents, and our issued patents and any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged,
	invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot predict the extent of claims that may be allowed or enforced upon our patents
	nor be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file
	patent applications that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to partake in proceedings to
	determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
	Moreover, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product we may develop, it
	is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, related patents will have expired or will expire
	a short period following commercial launch, thereby reducing the advantage of such patent. Loss or invalidation of certain of our

	trials, we believe that ND0801 will have a sustainable competitive advantage over the current alternatives, and at the very least
	offer an alternative mode of administration. See &ldquo;&mdash;Cognition and our ND0801 Product Candidate&rdquo; for the results
	of our clinical trials.

	Our business is subject to extensive government

	factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates and in ongoing research and development activities.
	On April 10, 2012, we held a pre-IND meeting with the DNP. In this meeting, the DNP stated that ND0612L would be eligible for the
	submission of a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway application, which allows expedited regulatory development with reduced clinical trials,
	see&nbsp;&ldquo;&mdash;United States&mdash;Section 505(b)(2) NDAs.&rdquo; The DNP also provided a clinical trials framework that
	would allow for a 505(b)(2) submission. We therefore seek to submit an NDA pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA in the first
	half of 2017. On May 22, 2014, the EMA confirmed that our product candidate, ND0612H, was eligible for a European Union marketing
	authorization application via a centralized procedure, which allows ND0612H to be able to benefit from more streamlined access
	to the EU market.

	In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs
	under the FDCA and related regulations and other laws. Drug products require the submission of a NDA and approval by the FDA prior
	to being marketed in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate
	federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
	Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or
	after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, and enforcement actions brought by
	the FDA, the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. Possible sanctions may include the FDA's refusal to approve
	pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures,
	total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement

	505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or

	In the United States, we intend

	and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture, control and composition
	of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product candidate for a proposed indication.
	Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.1 million,
	and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $104,000
	per product and $554,600 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. Each NDA submitted to the FDA for approval
	is typically reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 45 to 60 days following submission of the application.
	If found complete, the FDA will &ldquo;file&rdquo; the NDA, thus triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse
	to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The FDA&rsquo;s established goal
	is to review 90% of NDA applications and original efficacy supplements given &ldquo;Priority&rdquo; status within six months and

	Before approving an NDA, the FDA generally inspects
	the facilities at which the product is manufactured or facilities that are significantly involved in the product development and
	distribution process, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may deny approval of a NDA
	if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can delay
	the approval process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or may never be granted. If a product is approved,
	the approval will impose limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements
	be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the
	approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk management
	plan, or may impose other limitations.

	Any drug product for which

	requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information
	on an annual basis or more frequently for specific events, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain
	electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and
	advertising requirements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs
	for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug&rsquo;s approved labeling, known as &ldquo;off-label use,&rdquo;
	and other promotional activities, such as those considered to be false or misleading. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can
	have negative consequences, including the immediate discontinuation of noncomplying materials, adverse publicity, enforcement letters
	from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Such enforcement
	may also lead to scrutiny and enforcement by other government and regulatory bodies. Although physicians may prescribe legally
	available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not encourage, market or promote such off-label uses. As a result, &ldquo;off-label

	Our product candidates are manufactured at third-party facilities, which are cGMP certified. The FDA&rsquo;s cGMP regulations require,
	among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of comprehensive records and
	documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required
	to register their establishments and list any products they make with the FDA and to comply with related requirements in certain
	states. These entities are further subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance
	with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and
	quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive
	restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, as well as lead to potential market disruptions. These restrictions
	may include recalls, suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, and continuing oversight
	of manufacturing by the FDA under a &ldquo;consent decree,&rdquo; which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing
	inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to

	Under the Orphan Drug Act,
	the FDA may designate a drug product as an &ldquo;orphan drug&rdquo; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally
	meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation
	that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition
	will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a NDA. If the
	request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation
	entitles a party to seven years of market exclusivity following drug product approval, but does not convey any advantage in or

	If a product with orphan status
	receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product will be entitled to
	orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product
	for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval for different
	products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a
	different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication
	broader than that designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.

	In 1984, with passage of the
	Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Hatch-Waxman Act,&rdquo; Congress
	authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions
	of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to
	the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously
	conducted for a drug product previously approved under a NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.

	Specifically, in order for
	an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients,
	the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that
	the generic drug is &ldquo;bioequivalent&rdquo; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a
	RLD if &ldquo;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption
	of the listed drug. . . .&rdquo;.

	Upon approval of an ANDA,
	the FDA indicates that the generic product is &ldquo;therapeutically equivalent&rdquo; to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic
	equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication &ldquo;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&rdquo;
	also referred to as the &ldquo;Orange Book.&rdquo; Physicians and pharmacists consider an &ldquo;AB&rdquo; therapeutic equivalence
	rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous
	health insurance programs, the FDA&rsquo;s designation of an &ldquo;AB&rdquo; rating often results in substitution of the generic
	drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.

	The FDCA provides a period
	of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has
	been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by
	a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product
	approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical
	investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential
	to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product,
	such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.

	The centralized procedure
	provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states, plus by extension the European
	Economic Area, or EEA, member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines
	produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active
	substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for those products that are highly
	innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Products that have received orphan drug designation
	in the European Union will qualify for this centralized procedure, under which each product&rsquo;s marketing authorization application
	is submitted to the EMA. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum time frame for the evaluation of a
	marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided
	by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use). On May&nbsp;22, 2014, the
	EMA confirmed that our product candidate, ND0612H, was eligible for a European Union marketing authorization application via a
	centralized procedure, which allows ND0612H to be able to benefit from a more streamlined access to the EU market.

	Applications in respect of

	provide for a harmonized protection period regardless of the approval route utilized. The harmonized protection period is in total
	10 years, including eight years of research data protection and two years of marketing protection. The effect is that the originator&rsquo;s

	data protection period has expired, be found on the originator&rsquo;s file and used for assessment of the generic medicinal product.
	The 10-year protection period can be extended to 11 years where, in the first eight years post-authorization, the holder of the

	Under Article 10a of Directive
	2001/83/EC, an applicant may, in substitution for the results of its own preclinical and clinical research, present detailed references
	to published literature demonstrating that the active substance(s) of a product have a well-established medicinal use within the
	European Union with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. The applicant is entitled to refer to a variety of different
	types of literature, including reports of clinical trials with the same active substance(s) and epidemiological studies that indicate
	that the constituent or constituents of the product have an acceptable safety/efficacy profile for a particular indication. However,
	use of the published literature exemption is restricted by stating that in no circumstances will constituents be treated as having
	a well-established use if they have been used for less than 10 years from the first systematic and documented use of the substance
	as a medicinal product in the EU. Even after 10 years&rsquo; systematic use, the threshold for well-established medicinal use might
	not be met. European pharmaceutical law requires the competent authorities to consider the period over which a substance has been
	used, the amount of patient use of the substance, the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (as reflected in
	the scientific literature) and the coherence (consistency) of all the scientific assessments made in the literature. For this reason,
	different substances may reach the threshold for well-established use after different periods, but the minimum period is 10 years.
	If the applicant seeks approval of an entirely new therapeutic use, route of administration or dosage form compared with that to
	which the published literature refers, additional preclinical and/or clinical results would have to be provided. Such so-called
	&ldquo;mixed data&rdquo; applications are considered complete, free-standing marketing authorizations that would be a valid reference
	product and may therefore benefit from a period of regulatory exclusivity.

	European Union for some time. However, this would require that the new product has been developed and approved based on a complete,
	free-standing marketing authorization dossier. Existing products containing the same active substance should not affect the regulatory
	data exclusivity of the new product unless the latter&rsquo;s development was not truly independent, for example if the applicant
	has the benefit of licensing agreements with the holder of an existing product approval, e.g. to access or use associated data,

	quality standards are aimed at assuring that medical devices are designed and manufactured correctly. While not mandatory, compliance

	The manufacturer is obliged
	to demonstrate that the device conforms to the relevant essential requirements through a conformity assessment procedure. The nature
	of the assessment depends upon the classification of the device. The classification rules are found in Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC
	and are mainly based on three criteria: the length of time the device is in contact with the body, the degree of invasiveness,
	and the extent to which the device affects the anatomy. Class I (low risk) devices are those that do not enter or interact with
	the body. Class IIa and IIb (medium risk) devices are invasive or implantable or interact with the body. Class III (high risk)
	devices are those that affect the vital organs. For Class I devices, the conformity assessment is carried out by the manufacturer
	itself, which self-declares conformity. However, for all other classes of devices, a notified body needs to be involved in the
	conformity assessment procedure. Notified bodies are typically private entities that are authorized or licensed to perform conformity
	assessments by national device regulatory authorities.

	Conformity assessment procedures
	require a technical review of the manufacturer&rsquo;s product and an assessment of relevant clinical data, obtained through clinical
	investigations of the device itself, clinical investigations of similar devices reported in the scientific literature, and/or published
	and unpublished reports of post-market experience of the device and similar devices. Notified bodies, to the extent involved, may
	also perform audits of the manufacturer&rsquo;s quality system. If a notified body is satisfied that the product conforms to the
	relevant essential requirements, the notified body will issue a certificate of conformity that the manufacturer will use as a basis

	Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage
	and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and other markets,
	sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement
	from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private
	health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may
	be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party
	payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved
	drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical
	necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct
	expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates,
	in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Additionally, our product candidates may not be considered medically
	necessary or cost-effective. A payor&rsquo;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement
	rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient
	to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

	In March 2010, the President
	of the United States signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades. The healthcare reform law substantially
	changes the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical
	industry. The comprehensive $940.0 billion dollar overhaul is expected to extend coverage to approximately 32 million previously
	uninsured Americans. The healthcare reform law contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal
	healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will
	result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician
	quality reporting system and feedback program.

	In the European Union, pricing
	and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after
	a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness
	of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member
	states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control
	the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead
	adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other
	member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward
	pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers
	are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert
	competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations
	for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

	drugs that are intended to make a significant difference in patients&rsquo; lives. Product candidates in our pipeline are designed
	to overcome major deficiencies of current treatments and achieve enhanced clinical efficacy through continuous, controlled administration,
	primarily subcutaneously or transdermally. Additionally, because our product candidates are based on reformulations of leading,
	approved drugs, we believe that most of them qualify for an accelerated, lower risk regulatory pathway to marketing approval.

	For moderate to severe Parkinson&rsquo;s disease,
	our product candidates are aimed at overcoming the most significant limitations of current LD/CD therapy. For over 30 years, oral
	administration of LD/CD has been the standard of care for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. However, despite its wide acceptance, oral
	LD/CD has significant limitations, primarily short half-life as well as low absorption and availability in the body. As a result,
	plasma levodopa concentrations fluctuate sharply, contributing to patients&rsquo; motor complications. At the advanced stages of
	the disease, patients do not respond to oral administration of LD/CD, motor complications are exacerbated and patients are left
	with limited treatment options that are highly invasive and/or burdensome. We have developed liquid formulations that for the first
	time enable 24-hour, continuous subcutaneous administration of LD/CD to overcome these limitations, maintain steady levodopa levels
	and offer patients a better quality of life.

	2013, we received approval for an 18-month, $1.0&nbsp;million grant from MJFF, subject to achievement of milestones, for our Phase&nbsp;II
	clinical trial of ND0612L. Upon commercialization of ND0612L or a derivative product, we are obligated to pay MJFF royalties of
	10% of the revenue received from the option, license, sale, transfer or use of ND0612L, its derivative product candidates or any
	new invention arising from the project or any product incorporating ND0612L and its derivatives after approval for marketing. We
	are obligated to pay a maximum of $2.0&nbsp;million in such royalty payments to MJFF, after which no future royalty payment obligation
	will exist. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we received two installments of the grant totaling approximately $0.4
	million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received the third and fourth installments of the grant totaling approximately
	$0.6&nbsp;million. For additional information related to our MJFF grant, see &ldquo;ITEM 4. Information on the Company&mdash;B.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	receive grants as part of our research and development programs approved by OCS. The requirements and restrictions for these grants
	are described in the R&amp;D Law. Under the R&amp;D Law, royalties of 3% to 4.5% on the revenues derived from sales of products
	or services developed in whole or in part using these OCS grants are payable by us to the Israeli government. The maximum aggregate
	royalties paid generally cannot exceed 100% of the grants made to us, plus annual interest, generally equal to the 12-month LIBOR
	applicable to dollar deposits, as published on the first business day of each calendar year. As of December 31, 2013, 2014 and
	2015, we had received in the aggregate $1.5 million, $1.9&nbsp;million and $2.8 million, respectively, from OCS for our research
	and development programs. The amounts that we received during 2014 and 2015 included funding under two new grants for our research
	and development programs in an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 million approved in 2014, and under one new grant for the
	research and development of ND0701 in an amount of approximately $1.0 million approved in 2015. Under applicable accounting rules,
	the grants from the OCS have been accounted for as an offset against the related research and development expenses in our financial
	statements. As a result, our research and development expenses are shown on our financial statements net of the OCS grants. Upon
	our generation of revenue, we intend to account for the royalties owed to the OCS as a liability.

	In addition to paying any royalties due,
	we must abide by other restrictions associated with receiving such grants under the R&amp;D Law, which will continue to apply to
	us following full repayment to OCS. These restrictions may impair our ability to outsource manufacturing, engage in change of control
	transactions or otherwise transfer our know-how outside of Israel and require us to obtain the approval of OCS for certain actions
	and transactions and pay additional royalties and other amounts to OCS. In addition, any change of control and any change of ownership
	of our ordinary shares that would cause a non-Israeli citizen or resident to become an &ldquo;interested party,&rdquo; as defined
	in the R&amp;D Law, requires prior written notice to OCS. These restrictions apply to all of our products and not just to ND0612L.
	If we fail to comply with the R&amp;D Law, we may be subject to criminal charges.

	profit or loss are non-cash expenses related primarily to the changes in the value of the shares underlying our convertible loans

	to be embedded derivatives because their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to the economic characteristics
	and risks of the host contract (the loan without the conversion feature and the prepayment feature). The issuance of certain convertible
	loans and warrants is initially recognized at fair value adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value at initial recognition
	and the transaction price (&ldquo;Day 1 profit or loss&rdquo;). Therefore, an unrecognized Day 1 Loss occurred on first recognition
	of these financial instruments. Unrecognized Day 1 profit or loss remains unrecognized until market inputs, principally &ndash;
	the value of the Company, become observable. In November 2014, following the IPO the Company&rsquo;s value became observable and
	the Company recognized a Day 1 Loss of $23.3 million.

	The fair value of financial instruments

	Method. As of November 14, 2014, the conversion date of the convertible notes that we issued pursuant to financing rounds in 2013
	and 2014 (which we refer to as the 2013 Notes and 2014 Notes, respectively) and the exercise date for the warrants that we issued

	Fair Value of our Ordinary Shares.
</I>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the
	consummation of our IPO, due to the absence of a trading market for our ordinary shares, the fair value of our ordinary shares
	for purposes of determining the exercise price for award grants was determined in good faith by our management and approved by
	our board of directors. In connection with preparing our financial statements, our management considered the fair value of our
	ordinary shares based on a number of objective and subjective factors consistent with the methodologies outlined in the American
	Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation,
	referred to as the AICPA Practice Aid. We also considered independent third-party valuations. After November 14, 2014, the date
	our ordinary shares began trading on the NASDAQ, the grant date fair value of equity based awards is based on the closing price
	of our ordinary shares on NASDAQ on the date of grant and the fair value for all other purposes related to share-based awards is
	the closing price of our ordinary shares on NASDAQ on the relevant date.

	IFRS 9, &ldquo;Financial instruments&rdquo;,
	addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of
	IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial
	instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for
	financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&amp;L. The basis of classification depends on
	the entity's business model and contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments
	are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in
	fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model
	used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of
	changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS
	9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic
	relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the 'hedged ratio' to be the same as the one management actually
	use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under
	IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The
	Company is yet to assess IFRS 9's full impact.

	On August 12, 2015, August 17, 2015 and
	October 29, 2015, our compensation committee, board of directors and shareholders, respectively, approved the grant of options
	to purchase 130,000 of our ordinary shares to Dr. Oded Lieberman, our chief executive officer, at an exercise price of $18.21.
	The exercise price was set based on the average closing price of our ordinary shares for the 30 trading days preceding the grant
	date by our board. These options were granted, in part, in acknowledgement of Dr. Lieberman&rsquo;s instrumental role in our operational
	successes, including our achievement of certain recent milestones such as the consummation of our IPO and follow-on offering. The
	options will vest in 16 equal quarterly installments at the end of each quarterly period commencing on the grant date. Notwithstanding
	the foregoing vesting schedule, the entire option grant (that is, all 130,000 options) would become fully vested and exercisable
	as of immediately prior to, and conditional upon a &ldquo;change of control,&rdquo; as defined in the 2014 Plan and as discussed

	shares delivered pursuant to &ldquo;substitute awards&rdquo; shall reduce the shares available for issuance of incentive stock

	Under the Companies Law, companies incorporated

	We comply with the NASDAQ Listing Rule
	that requires that a majority of our directors be independent. Our board of directors has determined that all of our directors,
	other than our Chief Executive Officer, are independent under that rule. In addition, pursuant to the Companies Law, at least two
	of our directors must be &ldquo;external directors.&rdquo; The definition of independent director under the NASDAQ Listing Rules
	and external director under the Companies Law overlap to a significant degree such that it is generally the case that directors
	serving as external directors satisfy the independence requirements under the NASDAQ Listing Rules. However, it is possible for
	a director to qualify as an &ldquo;external director&rdquo; under the Companies Law without qualifying as an &ldquo;independent
	director&rdquo; under the NASDAQ Listing Rules, or vice-versa. The definition of external director under the Companies Law includes
	a set of statutory criteria that must be satisfied, including criteria whose aim is to ensure that there shall be no factor which
	would impair the ability of the external director to exercise independent judgment. The definition of independent director under
	the NASDAQ Listing Rules specifies similar, if slightly less stringent, requirements in addition to the requirement that the board
	of directors consider any factor which would impair the ability of the independent director to exercise independent judgment. In
	addition, both external directors and independent directors serve for a period of three years; external directors pursuant to the
	requirements of the Companies Law and independent directors pursuant to the staggered board provisions of our articles. However,
	external directors must be elected by a special majority of shareholders while independent directors may be elected by an ordinary
	majority. See &ldquo;&mdash;&nbsp;External Directors&rdquo; for a description of the requirements under the Companies Law for a
	director to serve as an external director.

	Under the Companies Law, the board of

	directors, including all of the external directors, who must constitute a majority of the members of the compensation committee.
	However, subject to certain exceptions, Israeli companies whose securities are traded on stock exchanges such as NASDAQ, and who
	do not have a controlling shareholder, do not have to meet this majority requirement; provided, however, that the compensation
	committee meets other Companies Law composition requirements, as well as the requirements of the jurisdiction where the company&rsquo;s

	does not exceed an amount that may be paid to an external director. The compensation committee is subject to the same Companies
	Law restrictions as the audit committee as to who may not be a member of the committee.

	to which we refer as a compensation policy. Such policy must be adopted by the company&rsquo;s board of directors, after considering
	the recommendations of the compensation committee, and needs to be brought for approval by a company&rsquo;s shareholders, which
	approval requires a Special Approval for Compensation (as defined in &ldquo;&mdash;Approval of Related Party Transactions under
	Israeli Law&nbsp;&mdash; Fiduciary Duties of Directors and Executive Officers&rdquo;). Under the Companies Law, the board of directors
	may adopt the compensation policy if it is not approved by the shareholders, provided that following non-approval of such policy
	by the shareholders, the compensation committee and the board of directors revisit the matter and determine that the adoption of
	the compensation policy is beneficial to the company. In accordance with the foregoing requirements, our board of directors and

	A personal interest includes an interest of any person in an action or transaction of a company, including a personal interest

	respect to his or her vote on behalf of a person for whom he or she holds a proxy even if such person has no personal interest

	If it is determined that an office holder
	has a personal interest in a transaction, approval by the board of directors is required for the transaction, unless the company&rsquo;s
	articles of association provide for a different method of approval. Further, so long as an office holder has disclosed his or her
	personal interest in a transaction, the board of directors may approve an action by the office holder that would otherwise be deemed
	a breach of the duty of loyalty if it is performed by the office holder in good faith. However, generally, a company may only approve
	a transaction or action in which an office holder has a personal interest if it is in the company&rsquo;s interest. An extraordinary
	transaction in which an office holder has a personal interest requires approval first by the company&rsquo;s audit committee and
	subsequently by the board of directors. The compensation of, or an undertaking to indemnify or insure, an office holder who is
	not a director requires approval first by the company&rsquo;s compensation committee, then by the company&rsquo;s board of directors,
	and, if such compensation arrangement or an undertaking to indemnify or insure is inconsistent with the company&rsquo;s stated
	compensation policy or if the office holder is the Chief Executive Officer (apart from a number of specific exceptions), then such
	arrangement is subject to the approval of a majority vote of the shares present and voting at a shareholders meeting, provided
	that either: (a) such majority includes at least a majority of the shares held by all shareholders who are not controlling shareholders
	and do not have a personal interest in such compensation arrangement; or (b) the total number of shares of non-controlling shareholders
	and shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the compensation arrangement and who vote against the arrangement does
	not exceed 2% of the company&rsquo;s aggregate voting rights. We refer to this as the Special Approval for Compensation. Arrangements
	regarding the compensation, indemnification or insurance of a director require the approval of the compensation committee, board
	of directors and, subject to certain exceptions, also shareholders by an ordinary majority, in that order, and under certain circumstances,
	a Special Approval for Compensation. If shareholders of a company do not approve the compensation terms of office holders, other
	than directors, the compensation committee and board of directors may override the shareholders&rsquo; decision, subject to certain
	conditions.

	Israeli capital gains tax is imposed on
	the disposal of capital assets by a non-Israeli resident if such assets are either (i) located in Israel; (ii)&nbsp;shares or rights
	to shares in an Israeli resident company, or (iii) represent, directly or indirectly, rights to assets located in Israel, unless
	a specific exemption is available or unless a tax treaty between Israel and the seller's country of residence provides otherwise.
	Capital gain is generally subject to tax at the corporate tax rate (26.5% in 2015 and 25% in 2016 and thereafter), if generated
	by a company, or at the rate of 25% if generated by an individual, or 30% in the case of sale of shares by a Substantial Shareholder
	(i.e.,&nbsp;a person who holds, directly or indirectly, alone or together with another, 10% or more of any of the company's &ldquo;means
	of control&rdquo; (including, among other things, the right to receive profits of the company, voting rights, the right to receive
	proceeds upon liquidation and the right to appoint a director)) at the time of sale or at any time during the preceding 12-month
	period. Individual and corporate shareholders dealing in securities in Israel are taxed at the tax rates applicable to business
	income (a corporate tax rate for a corporation and a marginal tax rate of up to 48% for an individual in 2015).

	Notwithstanding the foregoing, a non-Israeli
	resident (individual or corporation) who derives capital gains from the sale of shares in an Israeli resident company that were
	purchased after the company was listed for trading on a recognized stock exchange in Israel or outside of Israel will generally
	be exempt from Israeli tax so long as the shares were not held through a permanent establishment that the non-resident maintains
	in Israel. However, non-Israeli corporations will not be entitled to the foregoing exemption if Israeli residents: (i) have a controlling
	interest of 25% or more in such non-Israeli corporation or (ii) are the beneficiaries of, or are entitled to, 25% or more of the
	revenues or profits of such non-Israeli corporation, whether directly or indirectly. Such exemption is not applicable to a person

	Additionally, a sale of shares by a non-Israeli
	resident may be exempt from Israeli capital gains tax under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty. For example, under the
	United States-Israel Tax Treaty, the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of an Israeli company by a shareholder who (i)
	is a U.S. resident (for purposes of the treaty), (ii) holds the shares as a capital asset, and (iii) is entitled to claim the benefits
	afforded to such person by the treaty, is generally exempt from Israeli capital gains tax. Such exemption will not apply if: (i)
	the capital gain arising from the sale, exchange or other disposition can be attributed to a permanent establishment of the shareholder
	that is maintained in Israel; (ii) the shareholder holds, directly or indirectly, shares representing 10% or more of the voting
	rights during any part of the 12-month period preceding the disposition, subject to certain conditions; or (iii) such U.S. resident
	is an individual and was present in Israel for a period or peiods aggregating to 183 days or more during the relevant taxable year.
	In any such case, the sale, exchange or disposition of our ordinary shares would be subject to Israeli tax, to the extent applicable;
	however, under the United States-Israel Tax Treaty, a U.S. resident would be permitted to claim a credit for such taxes against
	the U.S. federal income tax imposed with respect to such sale, exchange or disposition, subject to the limitations under U.S. law
	applicable to foreign tax credits. The United States-Israel Tax Treaty does not relate to U.S. state or local taxes.

	In some instances where our shareholders
	may be liable for Israeli tax on the sale of their ordinary shares, the payment of the consideration may be subject to the withholding
	of Israeli tax at source. Shareholders may be required to demonstrate that they are exempt from tax on their capital gains in order
	to avoid withholding at source at the time of sale. Specifically, in transactions involving a sale of all of the shares of an Israeli
	resident company, such as a merger or other transaction, the Israel Tax Authority may require from shareholders who are not liable
	for Israeli tax to sign declarations in forms specified by that authority or obtain a specific exemption from the Israel Tax Authority
	to confirm their status as non-Israeli residents, and, in the absence of such declarations or exemptions, may require the purchaser
	of the shares to withhold taxes at source.

	Non-Israeli residents (whether individuals
	or corporations) are generally subject to Israeli withholding tax on the receipt of dividends paid on our ordinary shares at the
	rate of 25%, unless relief is provided in a treaty between Israel and the shareholder's country of residence (subject to the receipt
	in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority allowing for a reduced tax rate). With respect to a person who
	is a Substantial Shareholder at the time of receiving the dividend or at any time during the preceding 12 months, subject to the
	terms of an applicable tax treaty, the applicable withholding tax rate is 30%, unless such Substantial Shareholder holds such shares
	through a nominee company, in which case the rate is 25%. If the dividend is distributed from income attributed to a Preferred
	Enterprise, the applicable withholding tax rate is 20%, subject to certain conditions, unless a reduced rate is provided under
	an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority allowing for a
	reduced tax rate). If the dividend is attributable partly to income derived from a Preferred Enterprise, and partly from other
	sources of income, the withholding rate will be a blended rate reflecting the relative portions of the two types of income.

	For example, under the United States-Israel
	Tax Treaty, the maximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on dividends paid to a holder of our ordinary shares who is a
	U.S. resident (for purposes of the United States-Israel Tax Treaty) is 25%. However, for dividends not generated by a Preferred
	Enterprise and paid to a U.S. corporation holding 10% or more of the outstanding voting rights throughout the tax year in which
	the dividend is distributed as well as during the previous tax year, the maximum rate of withholding tax is generally 12.5%, provided
	that not more than 25% of the gross income for such preceding year consists of certain types of dividends and interest. U.S. residents
	who are subject to Israeli withholding tax on a dividend may be entitled to a credit or deduction for United States federal income
	tax purposes in the amount of the taxes withheld, subject to detailed limitations under U.S. laws applicable to foreign tax credits.

	years or your holding period for our ordinary shares) and (b) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of our ordinary
	shares. Under the Excess Distribution Regime, any excess distribution and realized gain will be treated as ordinary income and
	will be subject to tax as if (a) the excess distribution or gain had been realized ratably over your holding period, (b) the amount
	deemed realized in each year had been subject to tax in each year of that holding period at the highest marginal rate for such
	year (other than income allocated to the current period or any taxable period before we became a PFIC, which would be subject to
	tax at the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s regular ordinary income rate for the current year and would not be subject to the interest change
	discussed below), and (c) the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax had been imposed on the taxes deemed

	Regulations provide that a qualified exchange is (a) a United States securities exchange that is registered with the SEC, (b) the
	United States market system established pursuant to section 11A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, or (c) a non-U.S. securities
	exchange that is regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located, provided that
	(i) such non-U.S. exchange has trading volume, listing, financial disclosure, surveillance and other requirements designed to prevent
	fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open, fair and
	orderly, market, and to protect investors; and the laws of the country in which such non-U.S. exchange is located and the rules
	of such non-U.S. exchange ensure that such requirements are actually enforced and (ii) the rules of such non-U.S. exchange effectively
	promote active trading of listed stocks. Our ordinary shares have been approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, which
	is a United States securities exchange that is registered with the SEC. However, no assurance can be given that our ordinary shares
	will meet the requirements to be treated as &ldquo;regularly traded&rdquo; for purposes of the mark-to-market election. In addition,
	because a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that we may own, a U.S. Holder may continue to be subject
	to the Excess Distribution Regime with respect to such holder&rsquo;s indirect interest in any investments held by us that are
	treated as an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including stock in any future subsidiary of ours
	that is treated as a PFIC.

	Where a company that is a PFIC meets certain
	reporting requirements, a U.S. Holder can avoid certain adverse PFIC consequences described above by making a &ldquo;qualified
	electing fund,&rdquo; or QEF, election to be taxed currently on its proportionate share of the PFIC&rsquo;s ordinary income and
	net capital gains. Generally, a QEF election should be made on or before the due date for filing a U.S. Holder&rsquo;s federal
	income tax return for the first taxable year in which it held our ordinary shares. If a timely QEF election is made, an electing
	U.S. Holder of our ordinary shares will be required to include in its ordinary income such U.S. Holder&rsquo;s pro rata share of
	our ordinary earnings and to include in its long-term capital gain income such U.S. Holder&rsquo;s pro rata share of our net capital
	gain, whether or not distributed. Under Section&nbsp;1293 of the Code, a U.S. Holder&rsquo;s pro rata share of our ordinary income
	and net capital gain is the amount which would have been distributed with respect to such U.S. Holder&rsquo;s ordinary shares if,
	on each day during our taxable year, we had distributed to each holder of our ordinary shares a pro rata share of that day&rsquo;s
	ratable share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain for such year. In certain cases in which a QEF does not distribute
	all of its earnings in a taxable year, its U.S. Holders may also be permitted to elect to defer payment of some or all of the taxes
	on the QEF&rsquo;s undistributed income but will then be subject to an interest charge on the deferred amount.

	expect that the entire amount of any cash distribution generally will be reported as dividend income to you; provided, however,
	that distributions of ordinary shares to U.S. Holders that are part of a pro rata distribution to all of our shareholders generally
	will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Non-corporate U.S. Holders may qualify for the lower rates of taxation with respect

	If you are a U.S. Holder, subject to the

	tax credit. We would be treated as a United States-owned foreign corporation if 50% or more of the total value or total voting
	power of our stock is owned, directly, indirectly or by attribution, by United States persons. To the extent any portion of our

	United States-Israel Tax Treaty may, however, elect to treat any dividends as foreign source income for foreign tax credit purposes
	if the dividend income is separated from other income items for purposes of calculating the U.S. Holder&rsquo;s foreign tax credit.
	U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about the impact of, and any exception available to, the special sourcing rule

	Through December 31, 2015, our functional
	currency was the shekel, while our presentation currency was and remains the U.S. dollar. Even after we have transitioned to the
	U.S. dollar as our functional currency effective as of January 1, 2016, we continue to pay a significant portion of our expenses
	in shekels. As a result, the impact on our operating expenses of a change in the exchange rate between those two currencies impacts
	our total comprehensive loss as reported in U.S. dollars. We also make payments to service providers and invest in currencies other
	than in shekels. Our operating expenses in U.S. dollars accounted for 6%, 16% and 38% of our operating expenses in the years ended
	December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. See &ldquo;ITEM 3.D Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Our Management and Employees&mdash;Our

	To the extent the U.S. dollar
	weakens against the shekel, we will experience a negative impact on our operating expenses. A devaluation of the shekel in
	relation to the U.S. dollar has the effect of reducing the U.S. dollar amount of our expenses or payables that are payable in
	shekels, unless those expenses or payables are linked to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, any increase in the value of the shekel
	in relation to the U.S. dollar has the effect of increasing the U.S. dollar value of our unlinked shekel expenses, which
	would have a negative impact on our operating expenses. In 2014 and 2015, the U.S. dollar increased relative to the value of
	the shekel by 12.0% and 0.3%, respectively, relative to the prior year, eclipsing the 0.5% rate of inflation in Israel
	in 2014 and compounding the negative rate of inflation (-1.0%) in Israel in 2015, thereby reducing the U.S. dollar cost of
	our shekel denominated expenses. In 2013, the U.S. dollar depreciated relative to the shekel by 7.0%, which was compounded
	by inflation in Israel at a rate of 1.9%.

	The conversion feature and
	the prepayment feature of convertible loans issued to investors, except the 2014 convertible loan (see note 9), are considered
	embedded derivatives because their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to the economic characteristics
	and risks of the host contract (the loan without the conversion feature and the prepayment feature). Therefore, the Company separated
	the embedded derivatives from the host contract and accounted for each element separately. The conversion feature was classified
	as a financial liability as the loan was denominated in a foreign currency (and therefore its exercise price was not fixed in
	the Company's functional currency) and as the conversion price was subject to future adjustments. The conversion feature and the
	prepayment feature were measured as one embedded derivative since they related to common risks and depended on each other. The
	embedded derivative was classified as a financial liability and was initially recognized at its fair value at the date of issuance.
	The host contract was initially recognized as the difference between total consideration received for the convertible loans (including
	for the warrants, if applicable &ndash; see clause 2 below) less the fair value of the embedded derivative and the fair value
	of the warrants, if applicable. Transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of convertible loans were allocated to
	the host contract, to the embedded derivative and to the warrants issued (see clause 2 below) based on their proportionate initial
	recognition amounts. Such transaction costs allocated to the embedded derivative were recognized immediately in profit or loss

	IFRS 9, &ldquo;Financial instruments&rdquo;,
	addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version
	of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial
	instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for
	financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&amp;L. The basis of classification depends on
	the entity's business model and contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments
	are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in
	fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model
	used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of
	changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS
	9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic
	relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the 'hedged ratio' to be the same as the one management actually
	use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared
	under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
	The Company is yet to assess IFRS 9's full impact.

	The basic loss per share is
	computed by dividing the Company&rsquo;s loss by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the period.
	The convertible loans, warrants, options, Preferred Shares and A Ordinary Shares of the Company in the reporting years were not
	taken into account in the computation of diluted loss per share, since the effect of these potential Ordinary Shares is anti-dilutive.
	Therefore, the diluted loss per share is identical to the basic loss per share.
