	&#147;Securities Act&#148;), and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), that involve risks and uncertainties, principally in the sections entitled &#147;Business,&#148; &#147;Risk

	Form&nbsp;10-K,

	including statements regarding future events, our future financial performance, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.
	We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by terminology including &#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;believes,&#148; &#147;can,&#148; &#147;continue,&#148; &#147;ongoing,&#148; &#147;could,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148;

	guarantee their accuracy. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks outlined under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
	may cause our or our industry&#146;s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements to differ materially. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing
	environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we address the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause our
	actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

	You should not place undue reliance on any
	forward-looking statement, each of which applies only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the section entitled &#147;Risk
	Factors&#148; and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available
	to us on the date hereof, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to conform our statements to actual results or

	Business Overview

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical stage biotechnology company that discovers and develops Anticalin-based drugs to target validated disease pathways in a unique and
	transformative way. Our pipeline includes immuno-oncology multi-specifics tailored for the tumor micro-environment, an inhaled Anticalin to treat uncontrolled asthma and a half-life-optimized Anticalin to treat anemia. Our proprietary Anticalins are
	a novel class of protein therapeutics validated in the clinic and by partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies.

	Anticalin
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	proteins are a class of low molecular-weight therapeutic proteins derived from lipocalins, which are naturally occurring low-molecular weight human proteins typically found in blood plasma and
	other bodily fluids. Anticalin
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	-branded proteins function similarly to monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, by binding tightly and specifically to a diverse range of targets. An antibody is a large
	protein used by the immune system that recognizes a unique part of a foreign target molecule, called an antigen. We believe Anticalin proteins possess numerous advantages over antibodies in certain applications. For example, Anticalin proteins are
	small in size and are monomeric, meaning single protein units rather than a multi-protein complex. Therefore, we believe Anticalins are generally more stable biophysically than tetrameric monoclonal antibodies, composed of four protein subunits,
	potentially enabling unique routes of drug administration such as pulmonary delivery. Higher-molecular-weight entities such as antibodies are often too large to be delivered effectively through these methods. In addition, Anticalin proteins are
	monovalent in structure, which means they bind to a single cell surface receptor and which may avoid the risk of cross-linking of cell surface receptors where such receptors are a therapeutic target. Antibody-mediated cross-linking can occur when
	each of the two &#147;arms&#148; of an antibody binds to a cell surface receptor and brings these receptors into close proximity, which can lead to aggressive cell growth that is characteristic of cancer. While our basic Anticalin proteins have only
	a single binding site and are not subject to such cross-linking, our Anticalin-branded technology is also modular, which allows us to design Anticalin proteins to bind with specificity to multiple targets at the same time. This multispecificity
	offers advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as killing cancer cells. Moreover, unlike antibodies, the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of Anticalin
	proteins can be adjusted to potentially enable program-specific optimal drug exposure. Such differentiating characteristics suggest that Anticalin proteins have the potential, in certain cases, to become first-in-class drugs.

	able to detect any anti-drug antibodies, or ADAs, following administration of a total of 144 doses with five or more doses to 17 patients. We believe that these results demonstrated that there was no apparent immune response against PRS-050.
	Furthermore, dose-proportional PKs, pharmacology and biomarker activity were observed in the trial, which we believe demonstrates that PRS-050 engaged with its intended target VEGF-A in those patients. Despite these results, we, decided not to
	advance PRS-050 based on our belief that PRS-050&#146;s mode of action (the way in which it functions in the body, namely, antagonizing VEGF-A) was not sufficiently differentiated over the modes of action of already-marketed therapies, such as
	bevacizumab and aflibercept, to create enough economic value in the drug market to support continued development of PRS-050 as a competitive product candidate. While we have not advanced development of PRS-050 since that time for the aforementioned

	PRS-080 is an Anticalin
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">

</SUP>
	protein that binds to hepcidin, a natural regulator of iron in the blood. An
	excess amount of hepcidin can cause functional iron deficiency, or FID, which often cannot be treated adequately with iron supplements and can lead to anemia. PRS-080 has been designed to target hepcidin for the treatment of FID in anemic patients
	with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, particularly in end-stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis. We believe that by blocking the actions of hepcidin, PRS-080 will serve to address anemia by mobilizing iron for incorporation into red blood
	cells. Furthermore, we engineered PRS-080 to have a half-life of less than a week, so that following administration, it is expected to clear from the human body in a much shorter timeframe than antibodies, which typically have a half-life of two
	weeks or greater. We believe a shorter residence time in the body may be a superior approach for countering excess hepcidin, as physiological levels of hepcidin in these patients are relatively high (nanomolar concentration), and in theory such high
	concentrations will quickly saturate an administered binding drug. As a result, frequent administration of a drug may be required in order to sufficiently antagonize, or suppress the effect of, the target. The longer residence time of a mAb, could
	lead to the accumulation of both the drug and the target beyond the typical residence time of hepcidin, resulting in large quantities of hepcidin bound to mAbs. PRS-080 was investigated in a single-ascending dose Phase Ia trial in healthy subjects
	under governance by the BfArM. This study demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability of PRS-080 as well as dose-proportional pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetics. The inhibition of hepcidin and the subsequent change in parameters of
	iron metabolism such as the increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation confirmed the mode of action of PRS-080. This study was completed in 2015. The next phase of clinical development is a Phase Ib study in CKD patients requiring
	hemodialysis, which commenced in the first quarter of 2016 and is expected to be completed in 2016 in order to study safety and pharmacological activity in CKD patients.

	. Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have a half-life that is optimal for the indication area and a desired dosing schedule. Antibodies typically have half-lives of two weeks or
	longer, whereas Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have half-lives from hours to weeks, depending on the half-life extension technology employed, if any. This optionality allows us to exert greater control over the amount of circulating
	Anticalin protein in the blood and the amount of time such Anticalin proteins circulate in the blood, depending on the underlying biology we are trying to address.

	Modular platform for higher-order multispecificity and avoidance of cross-linking
</I>
	. Our Anticalin technology is modular, allowing for monovalent or multivalent target engagement, including multispecificity within
	a single protein. We believe that a monovalent &#147;backbone&#148; is an advantage in situations where pure antagonism of certain cellular receptors is desired. The dual-binding nature of monoclonal antibodies, which have two &#147;arms,&#148; can
	be a disadvantage in cases when the antibodies bind to and cross-link cell-surface receptors. Such cross-linking often leads to undesirable activation of the cells bearing those receptors. Single-action (monovalent) Anticalin proteins have only a
	single binding site and are thus not subject to cross-linking. Further, when it is called for by the biology we are addressing, we can create multispecific Anticalin proteins that can simultaneously bind (i)&nbsp;two or more different targets or
	(ii)&nbsp;different epitopes, the specific piece of an antigen to which an antibody binds, on the same target by genetically linking Anticalin proteins with distinct specificities on a common cDNA strand. We believe this multispecificity offers
	advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as killing cancer cells. Unique Anticalin proteins can be pieced together and undergo simultaneous target
	engagement as a single fusion protein, without generally compromising on manufacturability.

</SUP>
	drug candidate targeting hepcidin, a peptide mediator that is an important
	negative regulator of iron absorption and storage, derived from the naturally occurring human lipocalin known as NGAL. The normal function of hepcidin is to maintain equilibrium in iron supply for red blood cell production by binding to ferroportin,
	the protein that transports iron from the inside of a cell to the outside, inducing its internalization and subsequent degradation. The binding of hepcidin to ferroportin reduces the iron uptake from the intestine into the body and inhibits iron
	mobilization from cellular stores into red blood cells. An excess amount of hepcidin can cause FID, which often cannot be treated adequately with iron supplements and can lead to anemia. According to a 2009 publication by Young and Zaritsky in the
	Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, lowering hepcidin levels or antagonizing its actions would reverse the negative effects of inflammation on red blood cell formation by allowing mobilization of stored iron and improved iron
	absorption.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	PRS-080 has been designed to target hepcidin for the treatment of FID in anemic patients with CKD, particularly in end-stage renal disease
	patients requiring dialysis, to allow them to mobilize iron that is trapped in iron storage cells for use in the creation of red blood cells. We have also engineered PRS-080 to have a half-life of less than a week, so that following administration,
	it is expected to clear from the human body in a much shorter timeframe than antibodies, which typically have a half-life of two weeks or greater. This half-life was achieved by covalently linking PRS-080 to a specific polyethylene glycol, or PEG,
	in order to extend the serum half-life of the combined molecule to desirable levels. Since hepcidin is constantly produced by the body, we believe that a frequent, e.g. once per week, dosing interval will be optimally suited to interfere with
	hepcidin function. A half-life of about three days and a shorter residence time than mAbs is then in turn more compatible with the dosing schedule. A longer mAb-like residence time is not seen as advantageous, but rather could lead to the
	accumulation of both the drug and the target beyond the typical residence time of hepcidin, resulting in large quantities of hepcidin bound to mAbs. We completed a Phase Ia single-ascending dose clinical trial with PRS-080 in healthy volunteers in
	2015. The trial was conducted in accordance with German law at a clinical site in Neu-Ulm, Germany, that belongs to Nuvisan GmbH, our contract research organization, or CRO. Results from

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	According to the American Kidney
	Fund, approximately 31&nbsp;million individuals in the United States have CKD (Stages 1-5). The proportion of CKD patients with anemia increases with the severity and stage of CKD, however according to a September 2013 competitive landscape report
	conducted by Tech Atlas Group, overall rates of individuals with anemia among the CKD population are approximately 30%, and according to a 2004 study by McClellan et al., Current Medical Research and Opinion, approximately 47% of the CKD patients
	studied were found to be anemic. Extrapolating these percentages based on the CKD population of 31&nbsp;million individuals, we believe that approximately 9.3 to 14.6&nbsp;million individuals in the United States with CKD are anemic. CKD (Stage 5),
	also known as End-Stage Renal Disease, or ESRD, is the final stage of chronic kidney disease with approximately 0.64&nbsp;million patients in the US as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 according the U.S. Renal Data System, USRDS 2014 Annual Data Report.
	The Tech Atlas Group report also estimates that approximately 70%, or approximately 0.45&nbsp;million, of CKD (Stage 5) patients suffer from anemia. Anemia related to CKD is currently treated by injectable recombinant protein erythropoiesis, or red
	blood cell production, stimulating agents, or rESAs&#151;including Epogen, Aranesp, and Procrit&#151;with iron supplementation or a red blood cell transfusion. Based on the reported revenues of companies that market and sell rESAs, we believe that
	global sales of injectable rESAs were $6.3 billion in 2012, the vast majority of which were for renal indications.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Anemia is a serious medical condition in which blood is deficient in red blood cells, and hemoglobin, leading to
	inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and cells throughout the body. Anemia is generally said to exist when hemoglobin is less than 13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in women. Anemia has a number of potential causes, including nutritional deficiencies,
	iron deficiency, bone marrow disease, medications, and abnormalities in production of or sensitivity to erythropoietin, a hormone that controls red blood cell production. Anemia is a frequent and severe consequence of CKD. In addition, within the
	CKD population, anemia may be caused by FID. FID exists when, despite adequate stores, iron cannot be mobilized for erythropoiesis. In this case, despite treatment with exogenous erythropoietin and iron supplements, iron is still deficient.
	FID-anemic patients can be identified and selected for therapy using marketed laboratory tests for iron metabolism. The USRDS 2014 Annual Data Report estimates that as of 2012, approximately 409,000 individuals with ESRD are presently on
	hemodialysis. According to the results of a 2013 research analysis conducted for us by Artisan Healthcare Consulting, which, among other things, pooled research results from nephrologists in the United States, approximately 82% of the hemodialysis
	patient population are anemic, and that among the anemic hemodialysis patient population, up to 23% are FID-anemic. Based on the estimated 409,000 individuals with ESRD on hemodialysis, we believe that approximately 335,000 ESRD patients on
	hemodialysis are anemic and approximately 0.08&nbsp;million individuals are FID-anemic.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Untreated anemia is associated with chronic fatigue, increased
	risk of progression of multiple diseases, and death. These morbidity and mortality risks have been clearly shown in the CKD population, where in patients age 66 and older, anemic patients with mid-stage CKD (Stage 3) have a 149% increase in
	cardiovascular events, and patients with severe CKD (Stage 4 and 5) have a 24% increase in cardiovascular events, in each case versus non-anemic patients in the same group, according to a paper published in 2006 in the peer-reviewed journal
<I>
	Blood
</I>
	. Similarly, compared to non-anemic patients, anemia increases the mortality rate by 199% in mid-stage CKD, and 59% in severe CKD. Successful treatment of anemia significantly improves patients&#146; quality of life, especially with respect
	to vitality, fatigue and physical function. In addition, patients whose anemia has been successfully treated have demonstrated lower mortality rates, less frequent hospitalization, and decreases in cardiovascular morbidity.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe CKD patients with FID-anemia are especially poorly served. These patients have adequate stores of iron but this iron is not efficiently incorporated
	into red blood cell precursors through rESAs and iron supplements. According to the 2009 publication by Young and Zaritsky in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, this imbalance in iron metabolism is a result of a high level
	of circulating hepcidin in the blood stream. We believe existing therapies are limited in that they do not have an impact on hepcidin or, in the case of rESAs, patients often become resistant to the therapy.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	have engineered PRS-080 so that it binds to hepcidin and reduces the impact of hepcidin&#146;s negative regulation on iron mobilization. We believe that by blocking the actions of hepcidin, PRS-080 will serve to address anemia by mobilizing iron for
	incorporation into red blood cells.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In patients suffering from anemia of CKD, and specifically in patients with FID, hepcidin is frequently produced by
	the body in abnormally large amounts. Therefore, we believe that the best way to inhibit its function is to administer an inhibitor frequently, such as once a week. Our approach will use PRS-080 in connection with a conjugated PEG30 molecule, a
	well-known half-life extender, potentially allowing the drug sufficient residence time. Once coupled to PEG30, PRS-080 is intended to have a half-life that will be optimally suited for dosing anemic patients with CKD. In contrast, antibodies
	typically have a half-life of two to three weeks. Such a long half-life renders antibodies unsuitable for frequent administration and elimination of a circulating target protein like hepcidin because such antibodies tend to accumulate the target
	after binding due to their own long residence time in the body with the associated risk of bound hepcidin being released by antibodies that are still circulating in the blood.

	Our preclinical studies targeted the
	cynomolgus monkey orthologue of hepcidin, which has a high degree of similarity (96% identity) with human hepcidin. PRS-080 was found to bind with high affinity to the cynomolgus monkey version of hepcidin. We performed a dose finding study in
	cynomolgus monkeys, testing intravenous 30-minute infusions as well as subcutaneous injections of PRS-080. We also carried out a 4-week repeated dose toxicology study with intravenous infusions of PRS-080 for 30 minutes every other day. Our work
	included toxicokinetic and ADA measurements. During the study, safety pharmacology parameters on the cardiovascular system and respiration were monitored and all safety endpoints were met. Our preclinical studies also examined a different
	NGAL-derived Anticalin

	Hepcidin binds to ferroportin and
	induces its internalization and subsequent degradation, thus disabling iron mobilization from cells. PRS-080 binds strongly to hepcidin and inhibits its activity as shown in potency assays. These in vitro potency studies showed that the
	hepcidin-induced internalization of ferroportin is inhibited by PRS-080 in a dose-dependent manner. PRS-080 allowed for the restoration of ferroportin expression, overcoming the hepcidin-induced down-regulation, whereas NGAL alone did not have a
	similar effect on ferroportin expression.

	According to a 2012 Artisan Health Care Consulting analysis, as of 2011 asthma affects approximately 195&nbsp;million people in the U.S., Europe, Japan,
	Brazil, Russia, India and China. The analysis determined that approximately 16%, or 32&nbsp;million, of the group studied were considered to have moderate and severe uncontrolled asthma, while approximately 60%, or 19&nbsp;million, of the group of
	moderate and severe uncontrolled asthma studied were considered to have moderate and severe uncontrolled asthma with an elevated Th2 signature. Inflammation brought about by Th2 immunity is addressed by standard asthma therapies. 5-10% of patients

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The current standard of care for persistent, moderate
	to severe allergic asthma is omalizumab (Xolair from Roche) which is given in conjunction with high dose inhaled corticosteroids often in combination with inhaled long-acting beta adrenergic agonists, or LABA. Omalizumab was approved for this
	condition in the United States in 2003. Outside of the United States, omalizumab is approved for severe asthma. Omalizumab works by binding to the immune mediator immunoglobulin E, or IgE, and inhibiting IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and
	basophils, types of white blood cells. It has also been shown to impact some diseases, such as asthma, that are driven by eosinophils, another important class of immune cells. However, patient response to omalizumab has been shown to be
	inconsistent, as reported in a publication by McNicholl and Heaney in 2008 in the journal
<I>
	Core Evidence
</I>
	, which explained that in only some studies did omalizumab improve lung function. Furthermore, general asthma symptoms are also typically
	unaffected by omalizumab. Finally, in 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, issued a black box warning for omalizumab due to reported cases of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction suffered by some patients
	who had taken the drug. Despite these shortcomings, in 2012, worldwide sales of omalizumab were reported by Roche to be $1.2 billion.

	The next generation of therapies beyond omalizumab targets a broader range than just IgE mediated mechanisms.
	These approaches target other immune mediators, including IL-5, IL-4 and IL-13 (which act in concert on eosinophils, B-cells, epithelial cells, goblet cells and others) and CRTH2. Asthma is associated with high levels of eosinophils, immune cells
	that play a role in protecting the body against infection. The creation of eosinophils can be interrupted at the early stages, while the cells are still maturing. Multiple products are in development that target eosinophils and
	GlaxoSmithKline&#146;s, or GSK, mepolizumab which targets IL-5 was approved for severe eosinophilic asthma in adults and children older than 12 in 2015. However, eosinophils are only one of many cell types and immune system components that are
	involved with the body&#146;s exaggerated inflammation response in asthma. Mast cells, basophils, goblet cells and other cells also play a role. These cells can be seen infiltrating the airways along with eosinophils, leading to the conclusion that
	more cell types are involved. We believe that targeting just one of these components is not likely to be as effective in resolving severe asthma as an approach that targets the broader Th2 (cell-mediated) pathway.

	In 2013, Regeneron and its partner Sanofi reported proof-of-concept in a Phase IIa trial in persistent asthma with dupilumab, a currently unapproved
	monoclonal antibody that targets IL-4RA now in clinical development as a subcutaneously delivered agent. In a 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, Wenzel et al. reported that dupilumab showed a benefit on the asthma control
	questionnaire 5 (ACQ5) symptom score, a widely accepted measure for classifying the ability of a medication to control asthma. Patients dosed with dupilumab had fewer asthma attacks compared to placebo-treated patients when standard therapies, such
	as long-acting beta-agonists and inhaled glucocorticoids, were withdrawn, demonstrating the efficacy of dupilumab. Patients also showed improved lung function and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers. Dupilumab is administered
	systemically through injection. In November 2014, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that in a Phase IIb study, dupilumab also demonstrated improved lung function and reduced exacerbations when administered together with standard of care. These effects
	were observed in both unselected severe asthma patients and selected patients presenting elevated Th2 responses. We believe the results support the possibility of treating persistent uncontrolled asthma with a biologic therapy without narrowing the
	patient population based on the Th2 phenotype. Dupilumab is currently undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials for severe asthma.

	Another biologic in
	development for severe asthma is lebrikizumab, which blocks IL-13, a mechanism known to have a similar effect to that of dupilumab. Like dupilumab and other mediators of the Th2 pathway, lebrikizumab is a validating example for subcutaneously
	delivered Th2 intervention in treating uncontrolled asthmatics. In a 2011 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, lebrikizumab was reported to improve lung function in severe asthma patients who were also receiving standard of care
	inhaled glucocorticoid therapy. At the same time, patients in the study who received lebrikizumab showed greater musculoskeletal side effects than patients receiving placebo. We believe that the ability to impact disease biology and improve lung
	function with biologics such as lebrikizumab is a promising result.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	CD137, also known as 4-1BB, is a co-stimulatory immune receptor and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor, or TNFR, super-family. It is mainly
	expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, activated B cells, and natural killer, or NK, cells. CD137 plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses and thus is a target for cancer immunotherapy. CD137 ligand (CD137L) is the only
	known natural ligand of CD137, and is constitutively expressed on several types of antigen-presenting cells, or APC. CD137-positive T cells are activated by engaging a CD137L-positive cell. The induced CD137 clustering leads to activation of the
	receptor and downstream signaling. Note that the trimeric CD137L as a soluble molecule is not an effective CD137 agonist, providing evidence that larger scale clustering is required for activation. In a T cell pre-stimulated by the T cell receptor
	binding to a cognate Major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, target, costimulation via CD137 leads to further enhanced activation, survival and proliferation, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an improved capacity to

	The benefit of CD137 costimulation for the elimination of cancerous tumors has been demonstrated in a number of in vivo models in the mouse. The forced
	expression of CD137L on a tumor, for example, leads to tumor rejection. Likewise, the forced expression of an anti-CD137 single chain antibody fragment (scFv) on a tumor leads to a CD4+ T-cell and NK-cell dependent elimination of the tumor. A
	systemically administered anti-CD137 antibody has also been demonstrated to lead to retardation of tumor growth.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Human ex vivo data supports the
	extraordinary potential of CD137 as a costimulatory receptor in cancer therapy: It has been reported that for T cells isolated from human tumors, CD137 is an excellent marker for those that are tumor-reactive. In line with this observation,

	antibodies currently in clinical development are not ideal in that respect, as CD137 clustering can only be induced by binding to Fc

	We therefore hypothesized that to obtain an ideal CD137-targeting agent, a
	bispecific molecule should be designed that targets CD137 on one end and a differentially expressed tumor target on the other end. A visualization of the general concept is provided in Figure 1, below.HER2/CD137 bispecific is envisioned to promote
	CD137 clustering by bridging T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells, further enhancing its T cell receptor, or TCR,-mediated activity and leading to tumor
	destruction.

	To obtain a molecule that would work by the mode of action of costimulatory T cell engagement, we generated the HER2/CD137
	bispecific PRS-343. The molecule consists of two different building blocks binding to the two targets HER2 and CD137. To generate the CD137-specific building block of PRS-343, termed S0575.04J10, we utilized anticalin technology
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	. This technology works by engineering lipocalins to bind any desired target protein with high affinity and specificity, in a manner very similar to antibodies. The lipocalin family comprises a
	diverse group of mostly secreted soluble proteins that bind, store and transport a broad spectrum of molecules, ranging from small molecules to proteins. Lipocalins are structurally related by possessing an 8-stranded beta-barrel structure.
	Lipocalin-2, also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or NGAL, is a component of granules in neutrophils and is up-regulated during inflammation. The primary function of NGAL appears to be the sequestering of bacterial siderophores
	(iron chelators), leading to an inhibition of bacterial growth. A CD137-binding anticalin was generated based on a re-design of the natural binding pocket of NGAL using mutant anticalin libraries and a selection and screening process. The
	CD137-binding anticalin S0575.04J10 binds human CD137 with an affinity of 2 nM as determined by SPR, and is capable of costimulating human T cells when immobilized on a plastic dish together with an anti-CD3 antibody.

	that both targets can indeed be engaged at the same time, fulfilling the key requirement for simultaneous costimulatory engagement of T cells by HER2-positive target cells.

	In the U.S., the FDA

	compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product
	development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical
	hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or

	Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it
	enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with
	manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring
	safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt
	by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may

	as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs
	submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be

	which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA, or an approved letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The

	accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of
	an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical

	If a product receives

	The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted in 2012, made permanent the
	Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologicals, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under
	PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications
	in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the
	pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data
	needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a

	for a twelve-year exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA, the
	twelve-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there
	are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that may be substituted for the reference

	the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.&#148; In April 2013, the FDA issued a fourth draft guidance entitled,

</B>
	Formal Meetings between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or
	Applicants
<I>
	.
</I>
	&#148; The guidance documents provide the FDA&#146;s current thinking on approaches to demonstrating that a proposed biological product is biosimilar to a reference product. The FDA received public comments on the draft documents
	and intends to issue final guidance documents in the future. Nevertheless, the absence of a final guidance document does not prevent a sponsor for seeking licensure of a biosimilar under the BPCIA.

	Orphan Drug Designation
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or
	condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of
	disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its
	potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently
	receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same
	indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if
	our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA also administers a
	clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical trials to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions. A product does not have to be
	designated as an orphan drug to be eligible for the grant program. An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition. The study may address an
	unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.

	Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening
	disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate
	the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of
	the sponsor&#146;s request.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the fast track program and the FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or
	life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier
	than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability
	or lack of alternative treatments.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition
	that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous
	post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post- approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during
	post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate
	review of sections of a fast track drug&#146;s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a

	Under FDASIA, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law
	required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law&#146;s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. In June 2013, the FDA published a draft Guidance for Industry entitled, &#147;Expedited Programs for
	Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics&#148; which provides guidance on FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a drug is a
	candidate for these expedited development and review programs. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on a new program for Breakthrough Therapy designation. A
	request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to an IND. The FDA has already granted this designation to over 30 new drugs and has approved several.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Once an approval is granted,
	the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the
	product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA
	review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced
	inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future
	inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things,
	record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature
	requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the
	approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in
	Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA
	regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

	In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and
	distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 28-member European Union, before we may commence
	clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer
	or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

	Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a
	centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of
	AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European
	Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European
	Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more
	&#147;concerned&#148; member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the &#147;reference&#148; member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier,
	and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of
	receiving the reference member state&#146;s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed
	points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.

	When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we
	must adhere to the provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the
	submission and approval of a clinical trial authorization application be obtained in each Member State be obtained before commencing a clinical trial in that Member State.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing
	the entry into the marketplace of a competitor&#146;s generic product. For example, in the EU, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the European Economic Area, or EEA which is comprised of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway,
	Iceland and Liechtenstein, we expect they will benefit from 8 years of data exclusivity and an additional 2 years of marketing exclusivity. An additional one-year extension of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period,
	we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that is deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product&#146;s first marketing
	authorization in the EU and prevents biosimilars from relying on the holder of the marketing authorization for the reference biological medicine&#146;s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of 8 years. After 8 years, a
	biosimilar product application may be submitted and the sponsoring companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder&#146;s data. However, a biosimilar medicine cannot launch until 2 years later (or a total of 10 years after the first
	marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or 3 years later (or a total of 11 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization
	for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the 8 year data exclusivity period.

	As in the United States, a sponsor may apply for
	designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of
	market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.

	exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered
	cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.

	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug
	pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control
	the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product
	on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products
	launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to by significantly lower.

	trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for the trial, if applicable, or by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or
	termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities resulting
	in the imposition of a clinical hold, exposing participants to health risks caused by unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, development of previously unseen safety issues, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug candidate,

	our costs, slow down our drug candidate development and approval process and jeopardize regulatory approval of our drug candidates and our ability to commence sales and generate revenues. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our

	In order to market and sell our products in any jurisdiction, we or our third party collaborators must obtain separate
	marketing approvals in that jurisdiction and comply with its regulatory requirements. The review and approval procedures can vary drastically among jurisdictions, and each jurisdiction may impose different testing and other requirements to obtain
	and maintain marketing approval. Further, the time required to obtain those approvals, if any, may differ substantially among jurisdictions. In addition, in many countries or regions outside the United States, it is required that the product be
	approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country or region. Moreover, approval by the FDA or an equivalent foreign authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in any other countries or regions.
	As a result, the ability to market and sell a drug candidate in more than one jurisdiction can involve significant additional time, expense and effort, and would subject us and our collaborators to the numerous and varying post-approval requirements
	of each jurisdiction governing commercial sales, manufacturing, pricing and distribution of our drug candidates. We or any third parties with whom we may collaborate may not have the resources to pursue those approvals, and we or they may not be
	able to obtain any approvals that are pursued. The failure to obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in foreign jurisdictions could severely limit their potential market and ability to generate revenue.

	Based on our present expectations, we and our third-party contractors will be required to comply with current Good Clinical Practice, or cGCP, for all of our
	drug candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce cGCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our contractors fail to comply with applicable cGCP, the clinical
	data generated in the applicable trial may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving a drug candidate for marketing, which we may not have
	sufficient cash or other resources to support and which would delay our ability to generate revenue from any sales of such drug candidate. Any agreements governing our relationships with outside contractors such as CROs, or CROs or other contractors
	we may engage in the future, may provide those outside contractors with certain rights to terminate a clinical trial under specified circumstances. If such an outside contractor terminates its relationship with us during the performance of a
	clinical trial, we would be forced to seek an engagement with a substitute contractor, which we may not be able to do on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and the applicable clinical trial would experience delays or may

	There is significant uncertainty related to the third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. Market acceptance and successful

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pricing and
	reimbursement for any of our drug candidates that obtain regulatory approval is uncertain. Government authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors decide which drugs they will cover and establish reimbursement levels for them,
	and obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from any such third-party payors is a time consuming and costly process. Third-party payors also are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical
	products and services. As a result, any denial of private or government payor coverage or inadequate reimbursement for our drug candidates, if any are commercialized, could harm our business and reduce our prospects for generating revenue.

	Further, there have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels and in foreign jurisdictions directed

	adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products that would allow us to achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, governments may impose price controls on any of our products that obtain marketing approval, which may adversely affect

	In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to

	countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our drug candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our drug candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a

	We believe the
	choice-of-forum provision in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation will help provide for the orderly, efficient and cost-effective resolution of Nevada-law issues affecting us by designating courts located in the State of Nevada (our
	state of incorporation) as the exclusive forum for cases involving such issues. However, this provision may limit a stockholder&#146;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes to be favorable for disputes with us or our
	directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such actions against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents. While there is no Nevada case law addressing the enforceability of this type of provision, Nevada courts have
	on prior occasion found persuasive authority in Delaware case law in the absence of Nevada statutory or case law specifically addressing an issue of corporate law. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware ruled in June 2013 that
	choice-of-forum provisions of a type similar to those included in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation are not facially invalid under corporate law and constitute valid and enforceable contractual forum selection clauses. However, if a
	court were to find the choice-of-forum provision in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs
	associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On March&nbsp;20, 2014, Pieris instituted arbitration proceedings, or the TUM Arbitration, against Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen, or Munich
	Technical University and hereafter TUM, to address issues regarding the calculation of payments due from Pieris to TUM under Pieris&#146;s Research and Licensing Agreement with TUM, as amended, or the TUM License Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of
	the TUM License Agreement, the arbitration is proceeding in Munich, Germany and governed by German law, in accordance with the arbitration rules of the Deutsche Institution f&uuml;r Schiedsgerichtsbarkeit, or DIS.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On July&nbsp;4, 2003, or the Effective Date, Pieris and TUM entered into the TUM License Agreement, as superseded and replaced on July&nbsp;26, 2007, under
	which TUM has exclusively licensed, or in some cases assigned, to Pieris certain intellectual property and know-how that has become part of the Anticalin

	proprietary technologies. In return,
	Pieris agreed to pay to TUM certain undisclosed annual license fees, milestones and royalties for its own proprietary drug development and sales, as well as an undisclosed variable fee as a function of out-licensing revenues, or the Out-License Fee,
	where such Out-License Fees are creditable against annual license payments to TUM.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As required by the TUM License Agreement, Pieris provided to TUM its
	calculation of the Out-License Fee owed by Pieris to TUM for the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December&nbsp;31, 2012, the Dispute Period, in the amount of $0.4 million excluding value-added tax. TUM has asserted that, under
	the TUM License Agreement, the Out-License Fee due to TUM for the Dispute Period amounts to $3.4 million excluding value-added tax in the aggregate and has threatened to terminate the TUM License Agreement if the Out-License Fee is not paid. We
	believe that if TUM sought to terminate the license agreement for cause as a result of this dispute, it would potentially face wrongful termination claims for substantial damages if the arbitral tribunal in the TUM Arbitration sides with Pieris in
	its final decision regarding the proper amount of the Out-License Fee. We commenced the TUM Arbitration to request that the arbitration tribunal hold that our calculation of the payments owed to TUM is accurate and shall govern all current and
	future payments due in respect of the Out-License Fee under the TUM License Agreement.

	On November&nbsp;19, 2015, we received notification from the DIS
	of the arbitration tribunal&#146;s award. In its award, as corrected on January&nbsp;25, 2016, the tribunal dismissed the Company&#146;s request for declaratory judgment and granted TUM&#146;s counterclaim in an amount of only &#128;0.9&nbsp;million
	($0.9 million), of which, $0.6 million is recorded as research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the 2015 period due to a previous liability of $0.3 million recorded for the arbitration settlement as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014. Interest expense of $0.2 million was also included in the settlement and is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as interest expense, net. The tribunal dismissed the remainder of TUM&#146;s counterclaim.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Tribunal also ruled that TUM must reimburse us in the amount of &#128;0.1&nbsp;million ($0.1 million) for legal fees incurred and dismissed TUM&#146;s
	claim for reimbursement of its costs. We have decided not to challenge the award and paid the amount as calculated by the arbitration tribunal. The deadline for filing a motion to set aside the award expired on February&nbsp;15, 2016.

	On December&nbsp;5, 2014, Pieris completed a 2.272727-for-1 forward split of its
	common stock in the form of a share dividend, with the result that 6,100,000 shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the stock split became 13,863,647 shares of common stock outstanding immediately thereafter. On December&nbsp;16,
	2014, prior to the closing of the Acquisition, Pieris amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation to, among other things, change its name from Marika Inc. to &#147;Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,&#148; and increase its authorized capital stock
	from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of &#147;blank check&#148; preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. On December&nbsp;17,
	2014, Pieris transferred its pre-Acquisition assets and liabilities to its former majority stockholder, Aleksandrs Sviks, in exchange for the surrender by him and cancellation of 11,363,635 shares of Pieris common stock. All share and per share
	numbers in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relating to our shares of common stock have been adjusted to give effect to the stock split described above, unless otherwise stated.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the closing of the Acquisition, Pieris issued an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of its common stock to the former stockholders of Pieris GmbH in exchange
	for all of the outstanding shares (common and preferred) of Pieris GmbH&#146;s capital stock.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since March&nbsp;20, 2014, the Company
	was in arbitration proceedings, or the TUM Arbitration, against Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen, or Munich Technical University and hereafter TUM, to address issues regarding the calculation of payments due from the Company to TUM under the
	TUM License Agreement. Under the agreement, TUM has exclusively licensed, or in some cases assigned, to Pieris GmbH certain intellectual property and know-how that has become part of the
	Anticalin
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	proprietary technologies. In return, Pieris GmbH agreed to pay to TUM certain annual license fees, milestones and royalties for its own proprietary drug development and sales, as
	well as a variable fee as a function of out-licensing revenues, or the Out-License Fee, where such Out-License Fee is creditable against annual license payments to TUM. As required by the agreement, Pieris GmbH provided to TUM its calculation of the
	Out-License Fee for the period beginning July&nbsp;4, 2003 and ending on December&nbsp;31, 2012 in the amount of $0.4 million excluding value-added tax. TUM has asserted that the Out-License Fee for this period amounts to &#128;2.5&nbsp;million
	($3.0 million) excluding value-added tax and has threatened to terminate the license agreement if the Out-License Fee is not paid. We instituted arbitration to request confirmation that our calculation of the payments owed to TUM is accurate and
	will govern all current and future payments due in respect of the Out-License Fee under the agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On November&nbsp;19, 2015, the Company received
	notification from the arbitration tribunal of its award. In its award, as corrected on January&nbsp;25, 2016, the tribunal dismissed the Company&#146;s request for declaratory judgment and granted TUM&#146;s counterclaim in an amount of
	&#128;0.9&nbsp;million ($0.9 million), plus interest expense of $0.2 million. The tribunal dismissed the remainder of TUM&acute;s counterclaim. The Tribunal also ruled that TUM must reimburse us in the amount of &#128;0.1&nbsp;million ($0.1 million)
	for legal fees incurred and dismissed TUM&#146;s claim for reimbursement of its costs.

	We have not generated any revenues from product

	Sankyo Company Limited, or Daiichi Sankyo and, to a much lesser extent, grants from government agencies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The revenues from Sanofi and Daiichi Sankyo have
	been comprised primarily of upfront payments, research and development services and milestone payments. We recognized revenues from upfront payments under these agreements on a straight-line basis over the required service period because we
	determined that the licenses to which the payments related did not have standalone value. Research service revenue is recognized when the costs are incurred and the services have been performed. Revenue from milestone payments is recognized when all
	of the following conditions are met: (1)&nbsp;the milestone payments are non-refundable, (2)&nbsp;the probability of the achievement of the milestone is near certain, (3)&nbsp;substantive effort on our part is involved in achieving the milestone,
	(4)&nbsp;the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone, and (5)&nbsp;a reasonable amount of time passes between the up-front license payment and the
	first milestone payment.

	have several research and development programs underway in varying stages of development and we expect they will be continue to consume increasing amounts of cash for development, conducting clinical trials and the testing and manufacturing of

	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial

	amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Management makes estimates and exercises judgment in revenue recognition, share-based payments and income
	taxes. Judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities, and these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
	sources. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates and under different assumptions or conditions.

	When evaluating

	The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using
	the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units of accounting. We used best estimate of selling price methodology to estimate the selling price for licenses and options to
	acquire additional licenses to its proprietary technology because we do not have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence or Third Party Evidence of selling price for these deliverables. To determine the estimated selling price of a license to its
	proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements, terms of previous collaborative agreements, similar agreements entered into by third
	parties, market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our best estimate of selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the
	key assumptions used to determine the best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration among multiple deliverables.

	We typically receive upfront, nonrefundable payments when licensing our intellectual property in conjunction with a research and development agreement. In
	determining the units of accounting, management evaluates whether the license has stand-alone value from the undelivered elements to the collaborative partner based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement.
	Factors considered in this determination include the stage of development of the license delivered, research capabilities of the partner and the availability of Anticalin

	When management believes the license to its intellectual property does not have stand-alone value from the other
	deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, we generally recognize revenue attributable to the license on a straight-line basis over our contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of our research and development
	obligations. When management believes the license to its intellectual property has stand-alone value, we recognize revenue attributed to the license upon delivery. The periods over which revenue should be recognized are subject to estimates by
	management and may change over the course of the research and development agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accounting treatment for options granted to collaborators is dependent upon the nature of the option granted to the collaborative partner. Options are
	considered substantive if, at the inception of an agreement, we are at risk as to whether the collaborative partner will choose to exercise the options to secure additional licenses. Factors that are considered in evaluating whether options are
	substantive include the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the agreement without exercising the options, the cost to exercise the options relative to the total upfront consideration, and the
	additional financial commitments or economic penalties imposed on the collaborator as a result of exercising the options.

	We aggregate milestones into four categories (i)&nbsp;research milestones, (ii)&nbsp;development milestones, (iii)&nbsp;commercial milestones and
	(iv)&nbsp;sales milestones. Research milestones are typically achieved upon reaching certain success criteria as defined in each agreement related to developing an Anticalin

	protein against
	the specified target. Development milestones are typically reached when a compound reaches a defined phase of clinical research or passes such phase, or upon gaining regulatory approvals. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved
	pharmaceutical product reaches the status for commercial sale or certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount. Sales milestones are typically achieved
	when an approved pharmaceutical product exceed net sales as defined in each agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For revenues from research, development and sales milestone
	payments, if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable, such amounts are recognized entirely upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. Milestones that are not considered substantive are accounted for
	as license payments and recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of performance. To date, we have determined all milestones are substantive. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as
	revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Royalty payments are recognized in revenues based on the timing of royalty payments earned in accordance with the agreements, which typically is the
	period when the relevant sales occur, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

	is a company whose initial public offering was completed after December&nbsp;8, 2011 and had total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. Additionally, Section&nbsp;12b-2 of the Exchange Act
	establishes a class of company called a &#147;smaller reporting company,&#148; which generally is a company with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, if such
	public float is $0, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. We currently qualify as both an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting

	In December 2014, our Board

	our consultants in order to attract and retain such people, to induce them to work for the benefit of us and to provide additional incentive for them to promote our success. The Pieris Plan
	reserves for issuance 4,200,000 shares of our common stock. In addition the Pieris Plan provides for an &#147;evergreen&#148; provision whereby the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the Pieris Plan shall be
	automatically increased on January&nbsp;1 of each of year by the lesser of (i)&nbsp;1,000,000 shares, (ii)&nbsp;4% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on such date, and (iii)&nbsp;such other amount determined by the
	administrator. As of the date of this report, options to purchase 2,092,261 shares of our common stock have been issued under the Pieris Plan to our executive officers and directors, and options to purchase 1,801,450 shares have been issued under
	the Pieris Plan to other employees and consultants. For additional information, see &#147;Item 11. Executive Compensation&#151;Director Compensation&#148; and &#147;Item 11. Executive Compensation&#151;Employment Agreements with our Chief Executive
	Officer.&#148; As a result of such grants, 433,789 shares of our common stock remain available for future issuances under the Pieris Plan.

	Pursuant to a
	Stock Option Agreement with Ms. Deptula-Hicks, we granted her an option to purchase 450,000 shares of our common stock subject to certain restrictions on exercise and subject to the approval of the Company&#146;s shareholders of an increase in the
	number of shares authorized under the Plan to provide sufficient shares for such issuance upon the exercise of such award. If such shareholder approval is not obtained by September 30, 2016, the option will be cancelled and of no further force and
	affect. This option, therefore, does not have an impact on the remaining shares available for future grants currently authorized under the Plan Types of Awards. The Pieris Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, non-qualified
	stock options, stock grants and other stock-based awards, including restricted stock units.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	1. Audit services include audit work performed on the annual financial statements, as well as work that generally only an independent
	registered public accounting firm can reasonably be expected to provide, including comfort letters, statutory audits, and attest services and consultation regarding financial accounting and/or reporting standards.
</P>

	Prior to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The
	fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires our independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget at year end by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may
	become necessary to engage our independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires pre-approval before engaging our independent

	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the related
	consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
	Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in
	accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
	test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
	that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
	respects, the consolidated financial position of Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015,
	in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	Cash equivalents recorded by Pieris consist of highly liquid money market funds and are measured at fair value on a recurring

	Financial instruments that subject Pieris to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. Pieris maintains
	cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. Pieris maintains deposits and owns money market funds only in highly rated financial institutions to minimize the credit risk from the financial institutions. There were no money
	market funds held at December&nbsp;31, 2015. Management periodically reviews the credit standing of these financial institutions and believes that Pieris is not exposed to significant credit risk from the institutions in which those deposits are
	held and through which money-market funds are owned at December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	Pieris
	relies on third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical studies. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, Pieris may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for Pieris&acute;s
	drug candidates and Pieris&#146;s business could be substantially impacted. Furthermore, Pieris is exposed to the risks associated with third parties formulating and manufacturing its preclinical and clinical drug supplies and any approved product
	candidates. The development and commercialization of any of its drug candidates could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to provide Pieris with sufficient quantities of such drug candidate or fail to do so at
	acceptable quality levels, including in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and prices.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In line with such third-party risk, Pieris depends

	The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition
	criteria are applied to each of the separate units of accounting. Pieris has used best estimate of selling price methodology to estimate the selling price for licenses and options to acquire additional licenses to its proprietary technology because
	Pieris does not have Vendor Specific Objective Evidence or Third Party Evidence of selling price for these deliverables. To determine the estimated selling price of a license to its proprietary technology, Pieris considers market conditions as well
	as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements, terms of previous collaborative agreements, similar agreements entered into by third parties, market opportunity, estimated development costs,
	probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating Pieris&#146;s best estimate of selling price, Pieris evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the best
	estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration among multiple deliverables.

	Pieris typically
	receives upfront, nonrefundable payments when licensing its intellectual property in conjunction with a research and development agreement. In determining the units of accounting, management evaluates whether the license has stand-alone value from

	research capabilities of the partner and the availability of Anticalin

	collaborative partner. Options are considered substantive if, at the inception of an agreement, Pieris is at risk as to whether the collaborative partner will choose to exercise the options to secure additional licenses. Factors that are considered
	in evaluating whether options are substantive include the overall objective of the arrangement, the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the agreement without exercising the options, the cost to exercise the options relative to the total
	upfront consideration, and the additional financial commitments or economic penalties imposed on the collaborator as a result of exercising the options.

	In arrangements where options to obtain additional licenses are considered substantive, Pieris determines whether the optional licenses are priced at a
	significant and incremental discount. If the prices include a significant and incremental discount, the option is considered a deliverable in the arrangement. However, if not priced at a discount, the elements included in the arrangement are
	considered to be only the non-contingent elements. When a collaborator exercises an option to acquire an additional license, the exercise fee that is attributed to the additional license and any incremental discount allocated at inception are
	recognized in a manner consistent with the treatment of up-front payments for licenses (
<I>
	i.e.
</I>
	, license and research services). In the event an option expires un-exercised, any incremental discounts deferred at the inception of the arrangement
	are recognized into revenue upon expiration. For options that are non-substantive, the additional licenses to which the options pertain are considered deliverables upon inception of the arrangement, and Pieris applies the multiple-element revenue
	recognition criteria to determine accounting treatment. All of Pieris&#146;s agreements with options have been determined to include substantive options.

	At the inception of

	(a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the

	such amounts are recognized entirely upon successful accomplishment of the milestones. Milestones that are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of performance. To
	date, Pieris has determined all milestones are substantive. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are
	met. Royalty payments are recognized in revenues based on the timing of royalty payments earned in accordance with the agreements, which typically is the period when the relevant sales occur, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

	the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and Pieris is the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Acquisition are those of Pieris GmbH and are
	recorded at the historical cost basis of Pieris GmbH, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Acquisition include the assets and liabilities and results of operations of the combined Company. Share capital prior to the

	The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes&#151;An Interpretation of
	FASB No.&nbsp;109.&#148; FASB ASC 740 provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements in accordance with ASC 740-20. Tax positions must
	meet a &#147;more-likely-than-not&#148; recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of FASB ASC 740 and in subsequent periods. Pieris recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in
	income tax expense. No uncertain tax positions nor any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were accrued at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	The Company operates in multiple countries. Accordingly, separate tax filings are required based on jurisdiction.
	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
	generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in
	making this assessment. Management believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income in the U.S. or in its foreign jurisdictions to realize the full benefits of its U.S. deferred
	tax assets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets.

	As of December&nbsp;31,
	2015, the Company has U.S. federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $6.0 million, which expire through 2035. Utilization of the tax net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in any year due to limitations in the
	Internal Revenue Code. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had Australia tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $0.3 million, which will not expire.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had German corporate income tax and trade tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5.9 million and
	$5.7 million respectively. Based on German tax law, the losses can be carried forward indefinitely. The operating loss carryforwards generated are subject to restrictions under German tax law. These regulations may limit the future use of operating
	loss carryforwards if there is a change in ownership. As a result of the ownership change Pieris GmbH experienced from the Acquisition and Private Placement in December 2014, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that future use of
	the net operating loss carryforwards that existed prior to the Acquisition may be limited significantly or forfeited entirely and as such the Company has written them off accordingly during the 2014 and 2015 period. The Company files federal income
	tax returns as well as returns in multiple foreign jurisdictions. Tax years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 or later remain subject to examination by the German tax authorities. Tax years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and later remain subject to
	examination by the U.S. tax authorities.

	In
	November 2012, the Company and several of its stockholders entered into an unsecured Convertible Stockholder Loan Agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2014 (the &#147;2012 Bridge Loan&#148;). There were no outstanding principal or
	accrued interest balances under the 2012 Bridge Loan as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to the conversion to equity as discussed below. The 2012 Bridge Loan specified a maturity date of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and an interest
	rate of 12%&nbsp;per year through December&nbsp;31, 2013 and a rate of 18%&nbsp;per year subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2013.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On April&nbsp;14, 2014,
	the Company entered into a second bridge loan agreement (the &#147;2014 Bridge Loan&#148; and together with the 2012 Bridge Loan, the &#147;Bridge Loans&#148;) with certain of its stockholders pursuant to which the Company received a commitment for
	financing in the aggregate amount of &#128;2,000,000 ($2,420,200). The 2014 Bridge Loan included two tranches of available financing: (i)&nbsp;Tranche A of &#128;1,500,000 ($1,815,150) and (ii)&nbsp;Tranche B of &#128;500,000 ($605,050). In June
	2014, the Company borrowed 67% of Tranche A, or &#128;1,000,000 ($1,210,100). There were no outstanding principal or accrued interest balances under the 2014 Bridge Loan as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively due to the conversion to
	equity as discussed below. Loan amounts outstanding under the 2014 Bridge Loan accrued interest at a rate of 12%&nbsp;per year and had a maturity date of December&nbsp;31, 2015, after which the loan amounts would accrue interest at a rate of
	18%&nbsp;per year.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Bridge Loans did not contain financial or non-financial covenants. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the investors in the Bridge
	Loans exercised their option to convert all of the outstanding principal and interest amounts under the Bridge Loan into shares. For more information refer to Note 8-

	In
	May 2003, the Company signed an unsecured loan agreement (the &#147;Bank Loan&#148;) under a silent partnership agreement with Technologie-Beteiligungs-Gesellschaft (&#147;TBG&#148;), a minority interest stockholder. As of April&nbsp;3, 2014, the
	Company and TBG, the subsidiary of KfW Bank, Frankfurt (&#147;KfW&#148;), signed a repayment agreement concerning the Company&#146;s repayment of its liabilities to TBG outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2013 in a total amount of
	&#128;1.2&nbsp;million ($1.34 million). The principal amount bore interest at a rate of 10.53%. On December&nbsp;11, 2014, the Company and TBG entered into an accelerated repayment agreement in respect of the claims of TBG against the Company.
	Pursuant to terms of the accelerated repayment agreement and as stated on the 2014 consolidated balance sheet, conditioned upon closing of the Acquisition, the Company was obligated to pay &#128;1,050,000 ($1.27 million), the outstanding amount
	under the repayment agreement, in two tranches as follows: &#128;600,000 ($726,060) plus accrued interest on January&nbsp;31, 2015 and &#128;450,000 ($544,545) on March&nbsp;31, 2015. The outstanding principal amount for the first and the second
	tranches net of capital gain tax withheld, was repaid in full in March 2015 and such next payment was &#128;931,312 ($1,027,051). The capital gain tax withheld in the amount of &#128;118,688 ($130,889) was paid on April&nbsp;9, 2015 and no further

	On December&nbsp;17, 2014, subsequent to the Acquisition, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the &#147;Securities Purchase
	Agreement&#148;) with certain accredited investors (the &#147;Investors&#148;) providing for the issuance and sale to such Investors of an aggregate of 6,779,510 shares of the Company&acute;s common stock in a private placement offering conducted
	through a series of closings occurring in December 2014, at a purchase price per share of $2.00 and for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $13.6 million (the &#147;Private Placement&#148;). After deducting for placement agent and other fees,
	the aggregate net proceeds from the Private Placement were $12.0 million. Northland Securities, Inc. and Katalyst Securities, LLC served as co-exclusive placement agents (the &#147;Placement Agents&#148;) for the Private Placement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Securities Purchase Agreement also contained certain anti-dilution provisions. Those anti-dilution provisions provided that if the Company issued and sold
	equity securities or equity-linked or related securities at a purchase price per share of lower than $2.00 within the 180-day period following December&nbsp;17, 2014, each Investor in the Private Placement would be entitled to receive such number of
	additional shares of the Company&acute;s common stock as they would have received had such lower purchase price per share been applicable in the Private Placement. The 180-day period has passed as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and no anti-dilution
	provisions were triggered.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the closings of the Private Placement the Company issued to the Placement Agents and their designees, warrants (the

	In December 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan, (the &#147;Plan&#148;) which
	provides for the grant of stock options to certain designated employees of the Company, non-employee directors of the Company and certain other persons performing significant services for the Company as designated by the Compensation Committee of
	the Board of Directors. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the number of common shares reserved for issuance under the 2014 plan was 3,200,000. In addition the Plan provides for an &#147;evergreen&#148; provision whereby the number of shares of the
	Company&acute;s common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be automatically increased on January&nbsp;1 of each of year commencing in fiscal 2016 by the lesser of (i)&nbsp;1,000,000 shares, (ii)&nbsp;4% of the number of shares of the
	Company&acute;s common stock outstanding on such date, and (iii)&nbsp;such other amount determined by the Compensation committee of the Board of Directors. Vesting periods are determined by our Board of Directors; options primarily vest over a three
	or four year period. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, there were 487,671 shares available for future grant under the Plan.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s stock options
	have a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant. Stock options granted under the Plan may be either incentive stock options (&#147;ISOs&#148;), or nonqualified stock options. The exercise price of stock options granted under the Plan must be
	at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The Company&#146;s general policy is to issue common shares upon the exercise of stock options.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pieris granted 755,329 and 2,519,500 stock options during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these
	stock options granted in the 2015 period, an option for 450,000 shares was granted to a newly-hired executive officer subject to certain restrictions on exercise that require the Company&acute;s shareholders to approve an increase in the number of
	shares authorized under the Plan; if such shareholder approval is not obtained by September&nbsp;30, 2016, the option will be cancelled and of no further force and affect. This option, therefore, does not have impact on the remaining shares
	available for future grants currently authorized under the Plan and no compensation expense was recorded in 2015.

	The Company granted an option to

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On July&nbsp;4, 2003, the Company entered into the TUM License Agreement, which was subsequently renewed and, on July&nbsp;26, 2007, superseded and replaced.
	The agreement established a joint research effort led by Prof. Arne Skerra, Chair of Biological Chemistry of TUM, to optimize Anticalin
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	technologies for use in therapeutic, prophylactic and
	diagnostic applications and as research reagents, and to gain fundamental insights in lipocalin scaffolds. Prof. Dr.&nbsp;Skerra was a member of the Company&#146;s supervisory board when the parties entered into such agreement and during the period
	covered by the consolidated financial statements in this report. The Company provided certain funding for TUM research efforts performed under the agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of research efforts to date under the agreement, the Company holds a worldwide exclusive license under its license agreement with TUM to multiple
	patents and patent applications, including an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent, which patent will expire in 2027 (subject to a possible term adjustment period). The Company also holds an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent
	No.&nbsp;8,420,051, which patent is expected to expire in 2029. The Company bears the costs of filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents assigned or licensed to the Company under the agreement.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As consideration for the assigned patents and licenses above, the Company was required to pay certain development milestones to TUM. The Company is also
	obliged to pay low-single-digit royalties, including annual minimum royalties, on sales of such products incorporating patented technologies. If the Company grants licenses or sublicenses to those patents to third parties, the Company will be
	obliged to pay a percentage of the resulting revenue to TUM. The Company&#146;s payment obligations are reduced by the Company&acute;s proportionate contribution to a joint invention. Payment obligations terminate on expiration or annulment of the
	last patent covered by the agreement. The Company can terminate the licenses to any or all licensed patents upon specified advance notice to TUM. TUM may terminate the license provisions of the agreement only for cause. Termination of the agreement
	does not terminate the rights in patents assigned to the Company. The Company has incurred expenses related to TUM in connection with the transfer of licenses and protective rights of $41,791 during the nine month period ended September&nbsp;30,
	2015. Effective as of the fourth quarter of 2015, Pieris no longer deems TUM a related party due to Prof. Dr.&nbsp;Skerra no longer having a supervisory board position in Pieris GmbH or other direct relationship with the Company after the
	Acquisition. The Company has incurred expenses related to TUM as a related party of $0.1 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	TUM is a member of the EUROCALIN consortium and thus is entitled to receive payments under the grant agreement for research activities. Research activities are
	carried out by Prof. Dr.&nbsp;Skerra, who was a member of the Company&#146;s supervisory board when the parties entered into such agreement and during the period covered by the financial statements in this report. As Pieris AG was transformed to
	Pieris GmbH the change in legal entity removed the requirement of having a supervisory board; accordingly Prof. Dr.&nbsp;Skerra no longer holds a seat on the supervisory board. The government grant agreement with FP7 is further discussed in Note
	4&#151;Revenue.

	In connection with the issuance of nominal stock, payments of the share premium into additional paid in capital were deferred. Amounts were deferred for Claus
	Schalper and Prof. Dr.&nbsp;Skerra among others. During 2008 through July&nbsp;31, 2013, Mr.&nbsp;Schalper was the Chief Financial Officer of Pieris GmbH, and since August&nbsp;1, 2013, has served as a consultant to Pieris GmbH. During 2001 and
	through October&nbsp;10, 2014, Prof. Dr.&nbsp;Skerra was the deputy chairman of Pieris GmbH supervisory board. In connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Company waived all deferred payment claims against the aforementioned

	Dr.&nbsp;Skerra consulting fees of $16,717 during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. As of the fourth quarter of 2015 Pieris no longer deems Prof. Dr.&nbsp;Skerra a related party due to Prof. Dr.&nbsp;Skerra no longer having a

	(each as defined in the TUM License Agreement). These revenues include upfront license payments as well as milestone payments received by the Company from third parties. The Company has signed six such sub-licensing agreements between 2004 and 2012
	(the period under dispute), under which it has recorded revenues. The Company acknowledges an obligation to TUM; however, the parties disagree regarding the amount due.

	On March&nbsp;20, 2014, the Company instituted arbitration proceedings, or the TUM Arbitration, against
	Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen, or Munich Technical University and hereafter TUM, to address issues regarding the calculation of payments due from the Company to TUM under the TUM License Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the TUM License
	Agreement, the arbitration is proceeding in Munich, Germany and governed by German law, in accordance with the arbitration rules of the Deutsche Institution f&uuml;r Schiedsgerichtsbarkeit (the &#147;DIS&#148;).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On July&nbsp;4, 2003, or the Effective Date, the Company and TUM entered into the TUM License Agreement, as superseded and replaced on July&nbsp;26, 2007,
	under which TUM has exclusively licensed, or in some cases assigned, to the Company certain intellectual property and know-how that has become part of the Anticalin
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE:85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN:TOP">
	&reg;
</SUP>
	proprietary technologies.
	In return, the Company agreed to pay to TUM certain undisclosed annual license fees, milestones and royalties for its own proprietary drug development and sales, as well as an undisclosed variable fee as a function of out-licensing revenues, or the
	Out-License Fee, where such Out-License Fees are creditable against annual license payments to TUM.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As required by the TUM License Agreement, the Company
	provided to TUM its calculation of the Out-License Fee owed by the Company to TUM for the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December&nbsp;31, 2012, the Dispute Period, in the amount of $0.3 million excluding value-added tax. TUM
	has asserted that, under the TUM License Agreement, the Out-License Fee due to TUM for the Dispute Period amounts to $3.4 million excluding value-added tax in the aggregate and has threatened to terminate the TUM License Agreement if the Out-License
	Fee is not paid. The Company believes that if TUM sought to terminate the license agreement for cause as a result of this dispute, it would potentially face wrongful termination claims for substantial damages if the arbitral tribunal in the TUM
	Arbitration sides with the Company in its final decision regarding the proper amount of the Out-License Fee, but the Company can provide no assurance regarding the timing, nature or consequences of such decision. The Company commenced the TUM
	Arbitration to request that the arbitration tribunal hold that the Company&#146;s calculation of the payments owed to TUM is accurate and shall govern all current and future payments due in respect of the Out-License Fee under the TUM License
	Agreement. On December&nbsp;1, 2014, TUM filed its statement of defense maintaining its earlier calculation of the Out License Fee. On December&nbsp;23, 2014, TUM filed a counterclaim in the amount of &#128;2.5&nbsp;million ($2.8 million) to suspend
	the statute of limitations on its claim. The Company has reserved a liability on its balance sheet in respect of such payment in the amount of &#128;0.3&nbsp;million ($0.3 million). An adverse ruling in the TUM Arbitration could have a material
	adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On November&nbsp;19, 2015, the Company received notification from the
	DIS of the arbitration tribunal&#146;s award. In its award, as corrected on January&nbsp;25, 2016, the tribunal dismissed the Company&#146;s request for declaratory judgment and granted TUM&#146;s counterclaim in an amount of &#128;0.9&nbsp;million
	($0.9 million) of which, $0.6 million is recorded as research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the 2015 period due to a previous liability of $0.3 million recorded for the arbitration settlement as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014. Interest expense of $0.2 million was also included in the settlement and is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as interest expense, net. The tribunal dismissed the remainder of TUM&#146;s counterclaim.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Tribunal also ruled that TUM must reimburse the Company in the amount of &#128;0.1&nbsp;million ($0.1 million) for legal fees incurred and dismissed
	TUM&#146;s claim for reimbursement of its costs. The Company has decided not to challenge the award and paid the amount as calculated by the arbitration panel. The deadline for filing a motion to set aside the award expired on February&nbsp;15,
	2016.

	&#147;Our partnership with Roche is a significant step forward for Pieris,&#148; commented Stephen Yoder, President and CEO of Pieris. &#147;The decision by
	the leader in the development and commercialization of cancer biologics to collaborate with Pieris underscores the unique potential of Anticalin-based proteins as a differentiated class of immuno-oncology drugs. As we initiate this collaboration, we
	will continue to vigorously advance our fully proprietary programs, including our lead CD137-HER2 bispecific.&#148;

	With its immuno-oncology PRS-300
	Series, which remains proprietary to the Company, Pieris is developing bispecific Anticalin-based protein therapeutics against a variety of tumor and immunomodulatory targets. These compounds, including its lead program PRS-343 (CD137/HER2
	bispecific), aim to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment, with the goal of increasing efficacy as well as improving safety compared to existing approaches. This collaboration represents Pieris&#146; first partnered
	immuno-oncology program and leverages Pieris&#146; capability to address a target in multiple ways through Anticalin-based drug candidates in different formats.

	Anticalins:
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Anticalins are derived from lipocalins, small human proteins that naturally bind, store and transport a wide spectrum of molecules.
	Anticalins feature the typical four-loop variable region and a rigidly conserved beta-barrel backbone of lipocalins, which, together, form a shapeable cup-like binding pocket. Proprietary to Pieris, Anticalins are a novel class of protein
	therapeutics validated in the clinic and by partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies.
