	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using our
	proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid, or SMNH, chemistry platform. Our SMNH compounds are small segments of nucleic acids that we design to selectively target and modulate the activity of specific proteins implicated in various disease
	states. We are developing our most advanced SMNH product candidate, SB 9200, for the treatment of viral diseases. We have designed SB&nbsp;9200 to selectively activate within infected cells the cellular proteins retinoic acid-inducible gene&nbsp;1,
	or RIG-I, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein&nbsp;2, or NOD2, to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense. We believe that SB 9200 may
	play an important role in antiviral therapy by modulating the body&#146;s immune response through its mechanisms of action to fight viral infections. We are also developing a second SMNH product candidate, SB&nbsp;11285, as an immunotherapeutic
	agent for the treatment of selected cancers through the activation of the STimulator of INterferon Genes, or STING, pathway.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are
	developing SB&nbsp;9200 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis&nbsp;B virus, or HBV. In the second quarter of 2016, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial in non-cirrhotic patients infected with chronic HBV, in which patients first receive SB 9200
	as a monotherapy and then receive the oral antiviral agent Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). We expect to report preliminary results from the first dosing cohort of the Phase 2a clinical trial in the first half of 2017 with top line results
	for all patients treated with SB 9200 by the first half of 2018. Subject to the results of the Phase 2a clinical trial, we expect to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial in mid-2018 in patients with chronic HBV to explore the use of SB&nbsp;9200 as a
	monotherapy and in combination with Viread. Both trials are to be conducted under our clinical trial collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2014, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of SB&nbsp;9200 in 38 non-cirrhotic patients infected with the hepatitis&nbsp;C virus, or HCV,
	who had not received any prior antiviral treatment. The two-stage trial was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antiviral activity of ascending doses of the oral formulation of SB 9200 and to
	demonstrate proof of principle of the mechanisms of action of SB&nbsp;9200. SB 9200 was well tolerated in all dose groups in the trial, and no dose-limiting toxicities or systemic interferon-like side effects such as flu-like symptoms or fever were
	observed. Additionally, antiviral activity was seen at all dose levels except for the lowest dose cohort. We believe that the data from the Phase 1 clinical trial, together with data from preclinical and toxicology studies that we have conducted in
	animal models, support the continued development of SB&nbsp;9200 for the treatment of chronic HBV.

	Chronic HBV Infection
</I>
	. We are
	developing an oral formulation of SB 9200 for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The World Health Organization, or WHO, estimates that 240&nbsp;million people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV, including approximately 14&nbsp;million
	people in the United States and Europe combined. Standard of care treatments for chronic HBV include pegylated interferon-

	and oral antiviral agents such as Baraclude (entecavir), marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Viread and Vemlidy (tenofovir alafenamide), marketed by Gilead, each of which suppress viral
	replication. In 2014, reported worldwide revenues for Baraclude and Viread were approximately $2.5 billion in the aggregate primarily for the treatment of HBV. However, these treatments have limitations. In particular, although treatment with
	PEG-IFN-
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">
	&#097;
</FONT>
	products can reduce the amount of HBV DNA, or viral load, in the body, this treatment only has a limited effect on the rate of HBsAg reduction or loss. HBsAg is the surface antigen of HBV that
	indicates active hepatitis B infection. Oral antiviral agents such as Baraclude and Viread are potent suppressors of HBV DNA, but generally only suppress the virus during treatment without providing significant levels of HBsAg loss or clearance, and
	patients taking these oral antiviral agents require potentially life-long treatment. By achieving HBsAg loss or clearance, there is the potential to have a finite period of treatment and improved clinical prognosis, such as a reduction in the risks
	of cirrhosis and liver cancer. As such, experts believe that loss or clearance of HBsAg is indicative of a functional cure. We believe that there is a significant unmet need for treatments that can achieve a functional cure for chronic HBV when used
	alone or in combination with other antiviral agents.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Preclinical studies of SB 9200 in the woodchuck model of chronic HBV showed
	significant reductions in viral load, including viral replication intermediates, and in surface antigen. Since the discovery of woodchuck hepatitis virus, or WHV, in 1978, the American woodchuck has been studied and widely accepted as a suitable
	animal model for chronic HBV. We believe that SB 9200, by virtue of its mechanisms of action, may provide a functional cure for chronic HBV by stimulating the immune system in a manner similar to
	PEG-IFN-
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">

	products, but with better efficacy and tolerability.

<I>
	Other Development
	Efforts
</I>
	. We also plan to explore the potential use of SB 9200 in other viral diseases, including respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, latency and hepatitis delta virus, or HDV. According to the United States
	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, RSV infection in the United States accounts for approximately 177,000 adult hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among adults over age sixty-five each year and is the most common cause of lower respiratory
	tract infections in young children. There are no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of RSV infection. We believe that there is a significant unmet medical need for an effective treatment for RSV in pediatric and at-risk adult populations,
	including the immunocompromised, the elderly and those with respiratory co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Other Development Efforts for HBV
</I>
	. We are pursuing the development of the co-formulation of SB&nbsp;9200 with entecavir and with
	tenofovir as potential fixed-dose combination products for the treatment of chronic HBV patients who may benefit from the combined use of SB 9200 as an immunomodulatory agent, and entecavir or tenofovir, as the antiviral agent. We anticipate that
	the fixed-dose combination product could result in enhanced patient compliance and potentially allow for the delivery of lower doses of the individual compounds for equivalent efficacy and a more favorable safety profile. We have conducted early
	development work on the co-formulations and believe SB 9200 and the antiviral agents are compatible in the same formulation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also
	seeking to enter into collaborations with third parties that are developing compounds with different pharmacological mechanisms of action than SB 9200 for the treatment of chronic HBV. We believe that the immunomodulation provided by SB 9200 could
	be a key component of a combinatorial treatment of chronic HBV patients that could increase the percentage of chronic HBV patients that achieve a functional cure. In September 2016, pursuant to this strategy, we entered into an agreement with
	Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Arrowhead, to collaborate on the study of the combined use of SB 9200 and Arrowhead&#146;s small interfering ribonucleic acid, or siRNA, product pipeline, for the treatment of chronic HBV. Under our collaboration
	with Arrowhead, we agreed first to study preclinical models with both agents together, with the potential to be added to a clinical study.

	SB 11285
</I>
	. We are developing SB 11285, a novel proprietary STING agonist, as a
	potential immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers. Recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the STING pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote an
	aggressive and strong anti-tumor response through the induction of innate and adaptive immune response. In our studies performed
<I>
	in vitro
</I>

	viral replication, and secondly to stimulate the innate immune response through production of natural immunomodulatory cytokines, including interferon, inside cells through the activation of RIG-I and NOD2. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to block
	the protective effects of interferon production. Our SMNH compounds are designed to restore interferon production in infected cells. We believe that induction of the innate immune response is required for loss or clearance of HBsAg and the
	achievement of a functional cure.

	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. We have one product candidate, SB 9200, in the early stages of clinical development and all

	In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between
	different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing
	regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If we fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of SB 9200, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization
	prospects for SB 9200, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be negatively impacted.

	SB 9200 and our other product candidates are novel compounds and their potential benefit as antiviral drugs is unproven. SB 9200 and our other
	product candidates may not prove to be effective against the indications for which they are being designed to act and may not demonstrate in clinical trials any or all of the pharmacological effects that have been observed in preclinical studies. As
	of September&nbsp;30, 2016, we have only completed a single Phase 1 clinical trial of SB 9200. In that trial, we evaluated SB 9200 in 38 non-cirrhotic HCV infected patients as a monotherapy treatment for up to seven days. We conducted the Phase 1
	clinical trial in Australia and New Zealand in 2013 and 2014. We expect that the dose and frequency may be different for other indications of antiviral therapy. For instance, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial of SB 9200 for the treatment of
	chronic HBV in June 2016. The Phase 2a trial of SB 9200 for chronic HBV is of longer duration and involves sequential therapy with other antiviral agents. As a result, our Phase 1 clinical trial results in HCV may not be indicative of the results of
	our Phase 2a clinical trial in chronic HBV.

	development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Because of these and other risks described herein that

	Even if we obtain regulatory approval for SB 9200 or any other product candidate in chronic HBV or other indications, our product
	candidate may not gain market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors, patients or the medical community. For example, physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from existing therapies even when new and potentially more
	effective or convenient treatments enter the market. Further, patients often acclimate to the therapy that they are currently taking and do not want to switch unless their physicians recommend switching products or they are required to switch

	There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the
	indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs,
	including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the
	use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory
	discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.
	Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for

	Despite our efforts, we may be unable to secure additional collaborative licensing or other arrangements that are necessary for us to further
	develop and commercialize SB 9200 or any other product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment
	of the collaborator&#146;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator&#146;s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the potential differentiation of our product
	candidate from competing product candidates, design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the regulatory pathway for any such approval, the potential market for the
	product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering the product to patients and the potential of competing products. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications
	that may be available for collaboration and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and
	other terms of a collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the
	development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or
	marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to

	associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a product must be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We, and any future collaborators, may not
	obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority
	outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may file for marketing approvals but not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If
	we are unable to obtain approval of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union, Japan, China, South Korea or another foreign country or jurisdiction, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be significantly
	diminished and our business prospects could decline.

	of a product. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved
	indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#146; communications regarding off-label use and if we, or any future collaborators, do not market any of our product
	candidates for which we, or they, receive marketing approval for only their approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Similar post-market requirements may apply in foreign

	Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year that started in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2025, and the American Taxpayer

	as well as subject us and any future collaborators to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products

	In some countries, such
	as the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing
	approval for a product. The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in
	ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or
	product-licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control, including possible price reductions, even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we
	might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to
	generate from the sale of the product in that country. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we, or any future collaborators, may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to
	other available therapies, which is time-consuming and costly. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.

	The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions
	and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain. The
	steps we or our licensors have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States.
	Further, the examination process may require us or our licensors to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. The rights already granted
	under any of our currently issued patents or those licensed to us and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. Changes in the patent laws,
	implementing regulations or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may also diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain
	patent protection for our technology and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to

	As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other
	expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the exchange or market upon which we trade and other applicable securities rules
	and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial
	amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and
	regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.

	with the rules of the SEC and includes voting or investment power with respect to shares of our common stock. Unless otherwise indicated below, to our knowledge, the selling stockholders named in the table have sole voting and investment power with
	respect to the shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. The number of shares of common stock beneficially owned prior to the offering for each selling stockholder includes (i)&nbsp;all shares of our common stock held by such selling
	stockholder prior to the November private placement, plus (ii)&nbsp;all shares of our common stock purchased by such selling stockholder pursuant to the November private placement and being offered pursuant to this prospectus, as well as
	(iii)&nbsp;all options or other derivative securities held by such selling stockholder which are exercisable within 60 days of November&nbsp;30, 2016, and excludes the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise, which may occur on or after
	May&nbsp;24, 2017, of the warrants sold in the November private placement. The percentages of shares owned before and after the offering are based on 9,412,718 shares of our common stock outstanding as of November&nbsp;30, 2016, which includes the
	outstanding shares of common stock offered by this prospectus but excludes the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants sold in the November private placement, which may not be exercisable until May&nbsp;24, 2017. In computing
	the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of common stock subject to options and warrants held by that person that are currently exercisable or
	exercisable within 60 days after November&nbsp;30, 2016. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. The inclusion of any shares in this table does not constitute an
	admission of beneficial ownership by the person named below.

	Overview

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical-stage
	biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using our proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid, or SMNH, chemistry platform. We are developing our most advanced SMNH product, SB 9200, for
	the treatment of viral diseases. We have designed SB 9200 to selectively activate within infected cells the cellular proteins retinoic acid-inducible gene 1, or RIG-I, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2, or NOD2, to
	inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense. We believe that SB 9200 may play an important role in antiviral therapy by modulating the body&#146;s immune response to fight
	viral infections. In 2014, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of SB 9200 in 38 non-cirrhotic patients infected with the hepatitis C virus, or HCV, who had not received any prior antiviral treatment. In June 2016, we dosed the first patient in our
	ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial of SB 9200 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV. We expect to report top line monotherapy data from the first cohort (25 mg) of the Phase 2a clinical trial of SB 9200 in the first half of 2017. We
	are also developing a second SMNH product candidate, SB&nbsp;11285, as an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers through the activation of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, pathway. We also plan to explore the
	potential use of SB 9200 in other viral diseases, including respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and latency and hepatitis delta virus, or HDV and conduct early-stage research programs exploring the use of SMNH
	compounds against targets implicated in certain inflammatory diseases.

	We have not generated any revenue to date other than from grants
	from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. We have incurred significant annual net operating losses in every year since our inception and expect to continue to incur net operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses were $11.6
	million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and $14.9 million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2016. As of September&nbsp;30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $49.1 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses
	and increasing operating losses for the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly if and as we:

	We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended
	pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows.
	There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of
	patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of patients, number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each
	period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from
	amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular

	We have issued convertible notes with warrants on numerous occasions to finance our operations. When we issue
	convertible notes, we evaluate and account for embedded and freestanding features in our convertible note financings in accordance with professional standards. If the feature meets the definition of a derivative, professional standards generally
	provide three criteria that require companies to bifurcate the derivative from their host instruments and account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)&nbsp;the economic
	characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instruments are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b)&nbsp;the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument
	and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c)&nbsp;a separate instrument with the same terms as the
	embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. In accounting for convertible note financings, including the fair value of warrants issued in connection with the financings and the fair value of the stock underlying the

	We did not grant options until March 2015. We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on

	We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Use of this model requires that we make
	assumptions as to the fair value of our common stock, the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected
	dividend yield. Because we are currently a private company and lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information, we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a group of publicly traded peer companies.
	We expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our traded stock price. We use the simplified method prescribed by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
	No.&nbsp;107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of options granted to employees and directors. We base the expected term of options granted to consultants and nonemployees on the contractual term of the options. We determine the
	risk-free interest rate by reference to the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we
	have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

	Our common
	stock valuations were performed using the market approach to estimate our enterprise value in accordance with the AICPA Guide. The Market Approach is one of the three approaches (along with the Income Approach and Asset Approach) used to estimate
	enterprise and equity value. The market approach employs analysis using comparable companies in determining the value of the entity. Both public and private companies, if publicly available information exists, are considered in the Market Approach.
	Two information points commonly available, company valuation and transaction value, are used for their respective methodologies. There are a number of different methods within the Market Approach that may be used. The three main methods used are:
	the Guideline Public Companies Method, the Guideline Transactions Method and the Backsolve Method.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Beginning in 2012, we valued our
	common stock using the Backsolve Method. This method derives an implied market value of invested capital from a transaction involving a company&#146;s own securities. The price of a company&#146;s security that was involved in a recent arms-length
	transaction is used as a reference point in an allocation of value. The Backsolve Method requires considering the rights and preferences of each class of equity and solving for the total market value of invested capital that is consistent with a
	recent transaction in our own securities, considering the rights and preferences of each class of equity. Per the AICPA Guide, the Backsolve Method is generally the most reliable indicator of value of early-stage enterprises with no product revenue
	or cash flow, if relevant and reliable transactions have occurred in the company&#146;s equity securities. This methodology is also prescribed by the AICPA when a valuation is conducted in close proximity to the date of a financing transaction, and
	when other methodologies are deemed less reliable.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since December&nbsp;31, 2014, we have valued our common stock using the Guideline
	Public Companies Method, where there was not a direct equity financing with independent investors that could be used to determine enterprise value. This method derives a valuation based on the average multiple of market capitalization as compared to
	paid in capital of peer companies, which was then applied to our paid in capital balance.

	While there are many different value allocation
	methods, these various methods can be grouped into three general categories as defined by the AICPA Guide, one of which is the Option-Pricing Method, or OPM. We used the OPM to allocate market value of invested capital to the various equity classes

	our capitalization structure. We chose the OPM over other acceptable methods due to the complex capital structure of our company, the uncertainty related to market conditions, and the lack of
	visibility on an imminent exit event. Under the OPM, each equity class is modeled as a call option with a distinct claim on the equity of our company. The option&#146;s exercise price is based on our company&#146;s total equity value available for
	each participating equity holder. The characteristics of each equity class determine the equity class&#146; claim on the total equity value. By constructing a series of options in which the exercise price is set at incremental levels of value, which
	correspond to the equity value necessary for each level of equity to participate, we determined the incremental option value of each series. When multiplied by the percentage of ownership of each equity class participating under that series, the
	result is the incremental value allocated to each class under that series.

	avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.

	We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $15.6 million as of
	September&nbsp;30, 2016, in addition to the approximately $15 million in gross proceeds we received in connection with our November private placement, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures requirements at least into
	the third quarter of 2018 and to fund the Phase 2 clinical trial of SB 9200 that we initiated in chronic HBV in June 2016. However, we do not believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund all
	of the efforts that we plan to undertake or to fund the completion of development of SB 9200 beyond the ongoing trial. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than
	we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of SB 9200, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and

	Identifying potential product candidates and

	We are a clinical-stage
	biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using our proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid, or SMNH, chemistry platform. Our SMNH compounds are small segments of nucleic acids that we
	design to selectively target and modulate the activity of specific proteins implicated in various disease states. We are developing our most advanced SMNH product candidate, SB 9200, for the treatment of viral diseases. We have designed SB 9200 to
	selectively activate within infected cells the cellular pattern recognition receptors retinoic acid-inducible gene 1, or RIG-I, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2, or NOD2, to inhibit viral replication and to cause
	the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense. We believe that SB 9200 may play an important role in antiviral therapy by modulating the body&#146;s immune response through its mechanisms of action to fight viral
	infections. We are also developing a second SMNH product candidate, SB 11285, as an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers through the activation of the STimulator of INterferon Genes, or STING, pathway.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are developing SB 9200 for
	the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV. In the second quarter of 2016, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial in non-cirrhotic patients infected with chronic HBV, in which patients first receive SB 9200 as a monotherapy and then receive
	the oral antiviral agent Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). We expect to report preliminary results from the first dosing cohort of the Phase 2a clinical trial in the first half of 2017 with top line results for all patients treated with SB
	9200 by the first half of 2018. Subject to the results of the Phase 2a clinical trial, we expect to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial in mid-2018 in patients with chronic HBV to explore the use of SB 9200 as a monotherapy and in combination with
	Viread. Both trials are to be conducted under our clinical trial collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2014, we
	completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of SB 9200 in 38 non-cirrhotic patients infected with the hepatitis C virus, or HCV, who had not received any prior antiviral treatment. The two-stage trial was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability,
	pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antiviral activity of ascending doses of the oral formulation of SB 9200 and to demonstrate proof of principle of the mechanisms of action of SB 9200. SB 9200 was well tolerated in all dose groups in the trial,
	and no dose limiting toxicities or systemic interferon-like side effects such as flu-like symptoms or fever were observed. Additionally, antiviral activity was seen at all dose levels except for the lowest dose cohort. We believe that the data from
	the Phase 1 clinical trial, together with data from preclinical and toxicology studies that we have conducted in animal models, support the continued development of SB 9200 for the treatment of chronic HBV.

	Chronic HBV Infection
</I>
	. We are developing an oral formulation of SB 9200 for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The World Health
	Organization, or WHO, estimates that 240&nbsp;million people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV, including approximately 14&nbsp;million people in the United States and Europe combined. Standard of care treatments for chronic HBV include
	pegylated interferon-

	, products and oral antiviral agents such as Baraclude (entecavir), marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Viread and
	Vemlidy (tenofovir alafenamide), marketed by Gilead, each of which suppress viral replication. In 2014, reported worldwide revenues for Baraclude and Viread were approximately $2.5 billion primarily for the treatment of HBV. However, these
	treatments have limitations. In particular, although treatment with PEG-IFN-
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">
	&#097;
</FONT>
	products can reduce the amount of HBV DNA, or viral load, in the body, this treatment only has a limited effect on the rate of
	HBsAg reduction or loss. HBsAg is the surface antigen of HBV that indicates active hepatitis B infection. Oral antiviral agents such as Baraclude and Viread are potent suppressors of HBV DNA, but generally only suppress the virus during treatment
	without providing significant levels of HBsAg loss or clearance, and patients taking these oral antiviral agents require potentially life-long treatment. By achieving HBsAg loss or clearance, there is the potential to have a finite period of

	Preclinical studies of SB 9200 in the woodchuck model of chronic HBV showed significant reductions in viral load, including viral replication
	intermediates, and in surface antigen. Since the discovery of woodchuck hepatitis virus, or WHV, in 1978, the American woodchuck has been studied and widely accepted as a suitable animal model for the study of chronic HBV. We believe that SB 9200,
	by virtue of its mechanisms of action, may provide a functional cure for chronic HBV by stimulating the immune system in a manner similar to PEG-IFN-

	. We are pursuing the development of the co-formulation of SB 9200 with entecavir and with
	tenofovir as potential fixed-dose combination products for the treatment of chronic HBV patients who may benefit from the combined use of SB 9200 as an immunomodulatory agent, and entecavir or tenofovir, as the antiviral agent. We anticipate that
	the fixed-dose combination product could result in enhanced patient compliance and potentially allow for the delivery of lower doses of the individual compounds for equivalent efficacy and a more favorable safety profile. We have conducted early
	development work on the co-formulations and believe SB 9200 and the antiviral agents are compatible in the same formulation.

	We are also
	seeking to enter into collaborations with third parties that are developing compounds with different pharmacological mechanisms of action than SB 9200 for the treatment of chronic HBV. We believe that the immunomodulation provided by SB 9200 could
	be a key component of a combinatorial treatment of chronic HBV patients that could increase the percentage of chronic HBV patients that achieve a functional cure. In September 2016, pursuant to this strategy, we entered into an agreement with
	Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Arrowhead, to collaborate on the study of the combined use of SB 9200 and Arrowhead&#146;s small interfering ribonucleic acid, or siRNA, product pipeline for the treatment of chronic HBV. Under our collaboration
	with Arrowhead, we agreed first to study preclinical models with both agents together, with the potential to be added to a clinical study.

	We are developing SB 11285, a novel proprietary STING agonist, as a potential immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected
	cancers. Recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the STING pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote an aggressive and strong anti-tumor response through the induction of
	innate and adaptive immune response. In our studies performed
<I>
	in vitro

	cancer models, SB 11285 was shown to cause the induction of interferon and other cytokines and apoptosis of multiple tumor-derived cell lines. We plan to develop SB 11285
	as a potential important addition to the current standard of care in the treatment of various cancers that could increase the treatment responses in patients. We hope to achieve further pre-clinical proof-of-principle for SB 11285 in relevant

	Subject to the receipt of additional funding, we may explore the potential use of SB 9200 in other viral diseases, including respiratory
	syncytial virus, or RSV, human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, latency and hepatitis delta virus, or HDV. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, RSV infection in the United States accounts for
	approximately 177,000 adult hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among adults over age sixty-five each year and is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in young children. We believe the incidence of RSV infection in the adult
	population is significantly underdiagnosed, primarily due to the prior lack of rapid RSV diagnostics, which were only introduced in recent years. There are no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of RSV infection. While the antiviral ribavirin
	is used in severe cases of RSV infection, there are significant side effects and risks associated with the use of

	We are conducting a Phase 2a clinical trial of SB 9200 in non-cirrhotic patients infected with chronic HBV in which patients first
	receive SB 9200 as a monotherapy and later receive Viread (tenofovir). We expect to report preliminary results from the first dosing cohort of the Phase 2a clinical trial in the first half of 2017 with top line results for all patients treated with
	SB 9200 by the first half of 2018. Subject to the results of the Phase 2a clinical trial, we expect to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial in mid-2018 in patients with chronic HBV to explore the use of SB 9200 as a monotherapy and in combination with
	Viread. Both trials are to be conducted under our clinical collaboration with Gilead.

	Subject to obtaining additional financing, we may plan to

	inoculated with RSV. Scientific literature supports that HIV is able to replicate in cells by evading innate immune mechanisms involving sensory proteins such as RIG-I. In addition, studies suggest that disrupting HIV that is latent or dormant in an
	infected cell will require re-invigoration of the immune system. We believe that compounds that activate and induce RIG-I, such as SB 9200, may play a role in disrupting HIV latency or dormancy, allowing for the potential treatment and eradication
	of the disease with antiviral regimens. If we determine to proceed with the development of SB 9200 for HIV latency, we would seek to collaborate with major research centers and third parties with significant expertise in HIV to explore the potential
	use of SB 9200 in the eradication of HIV. In addition, we believe that therapies such as SB 9200, which can reduce or cause loss or clearance of HBsAg, may play an important role in the treatment of HDV co-infected HBV patients. Currently, long-term

</B>
	SB 9200 and our other SMNH compounds are designed to inhibit viral replication through 2 mechanisms: firstly, an interaction with DNA polymerase, an enzyme that is implicated in
	viral replication, and secondly to stimulate the innate immune response through production of natural immunomodulatory cytokines, including interferon, inside cells through the activation of RIG-I and NOD2. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to block
	the protective effects of interferon production. Our SMNH compounds are designed to restore interferon production in infected cells. We believe that induction of the innate immune response is required for loss or clearance of HBsAg and the
	achievement of a functional cure.

	We have multiple SMNH compounds in development for the treatment of viral diseases, including our lead product candidate SB 9200. We have
	designed our antiviral product candidates to selectively activate within infected cells the cellular proteins, RIG-I and NOD2, to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral
	defense. We believe that induction of the innate immune response is required for loss or clearance of HBsAg and the potential achievement of a functional cure.

	Interferon is an immunomodulatory cytokine with potent antiviral activity. Interferon activates both innate and adaptive immune responses in
	infected cells. The innate immune response is the first line of defense against virus infection before the adaptive immune response is induced. It is well established that the innate immune response is critical to restricting virus replication and
	infection, which results in diminished disease burden. The adaptive immune system is part of the overall immune system and is required to eliminate or prevent pathogen growth. Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response
	to a specific pathogen and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen.

	RIG-I and NOD2 are inactive in
	uninfected cells, but become activated when a cell is virally infected. The activation of RIG-I and NOD2 results in the production of interferon within the cells through a well-regulated signaling pathway. Viruses invade cells and are able to
	replicate and spread because they have evolved mechanisms to block the protective effects of antiviral signaling proteins such as RIG-I and NOD2. Viral genomes encode proteins that can block interferon synthesis and signaling, inhibit the function
	of interferon-induced antiviral proteins and produce interferon receptor decoy molecules to prevent induction of interferon signaling. Thus, by turning off interferon production and function, viruses abrogate the immune response, which enables them
	to rapidly multiply in cells.

	RIG-I
	is a protein that has three regions: (1)&nbsp;a caspase-activation and recruitment, or CARDs, region, which is implicated in interferon signaling, (2)&nbsp;the adenosine triphosphatase, or ATPase, region that is important for producing energy and
	(3)&nbsp;a regulatory domain, or RD, region that is important in recognizing characteristic fingerprints of viral double stranded RNA, or dsRNA. Upon exposure to viral double stranded RNA by the regulatory domain region of RIG-I, the ATPase region
	of RIG-I produces energy allowing the protein to move to and translocate on the dsRNA to confirm the presence of viral RNA, resulting in the full activation of RIG-I. Following activation, RIG-I combines with another molecule of RIG-I resulting in a
	dimerized RIG-I protein complex. Activation also exposes the CARDs region of RIG-I, leading to its ubiquitination, a process that involves the attachment of ubiquitin, a protein involved in signaling, to the CARDs region of both RIG-I molecules. The
	activated RIG-I complex then migrates to the mitochondria, where it interacts with the CARDs region of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling, or MAVS, protein. The interaction between the RIG-I complex and the MAVS protein causes the activation of
	interferon regulatory factor 3, or IRF3, which results in the induction and translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus where it leads to the expression of genes encoding proteins, including interferon-&szlig;, or IFN-&szlig;. The production of
	interferon causes cells to enter into an antiviral state, leading to apoptosis, or cell death, of virally infected cells, production of antiviral peptides and protection of uninfected cells.

	treatment-na&iuml;ve, HCV-infected adults in fasted and fed states. In Part A, each subject in a particular dose group received a single oral dose of 100&nbsp;mg, 200 mg, 400 mg or 800 mg of SB 9200, with subjects in each subsequent dose group
	receiving a pre-determined higher dosage than subjects in the preceding dose group. Part B of the trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in 30 treatment na&iuml;ve adults infected with HCV. In Part B, subjects were
	randomized on a 6:2 basis to SB 9200 or placebo. Each subject in the SB 9200 arms received an oral dose of 200 mg, 400 mg or 900 mg of SB 9200 once daily for seven days, with subjects in each subsequent dose group receiving a higher dosage than

	1.5&nbsp;log 10 in the 200 mg dose cohort to 1.9 log 10 in the 400 mg dose cohort. Increasing the dose to 900&nbsp;mg did not increase the peak individual serum HCV DNA drops observed in patients in the 900&nbsp;mg dose cohort. A 1.0 log 10

	Chronic HBV Overview.
</I>
	HBV is a virus most commonly transmitted by contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person.
	It may also be spread from infected mothers to their babies at birth. While there are vaccines to prevent HBV infection, vaccinations have not been universally adopted. According to the WHO, chronic HBV infection is among the most common persistent
	viral infections in humans. When an individual first contracts HBV, they are considered to have an acute infection. Individuals with an infection lasting longer than six months are considered chronically infected. Individuals chronically infected
	with HBV are at an increased risk of developing significant liver disease, including cirrhosis, or permanent scarring of the liver. In addition, according to the WHO, HBV causes up to 80% of liver cancers, and, according to the American Cancer
	Society, 85% of people with liver cancer die within five years.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In July 2015, the WHO estimated that 240&nbsp;million people are
	chronically infected with HBV worldwide, and that more than 780,000 people worldwide die every year due to complications of chronic HBV infection, despite the availability of vaccines against the virus. In addition, the WHO and CDC estimate that
	approximately 14&nbsp;million people are chronically infected with HBV in the United States and Europe combined.

	Oral antiviral agents for chronic HBV such as Baraclude (entecavir) and Viread (tenofovir)
	suppress viral replication. In 2014, reported worldwide revenues for Baraclude and Viread were approximately $2.5&nbsp;billion in the aggregate primarily for HBV. These oral antiviral agents are potent suppressors of HBV DNA, but generally only
	suppress the virus during treatment without providing significant levels of HBsAg loss or clearance, and patients taking these oral antiviral agents require potentially life-long treatment.

	Phase 2 Clinical Trials of SB 9200 in Chronic HBV

	. Based on the results of the woodchuck studies, we believe that SB 9200 may induce an
	antiviral immune response during chronic active infection that has the potential for a functional cure in the treatment of HBV through the loss or clearance of HBsAg. As a result, in the second quarter of 2016, we initiated a clinical program in
	patients with chronic HBV to explore both the use of SB 9200 as a monotherapy and in combination with Viread (tenofovir) in a clinical trial collaboration with Gilead.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are conducting a Phase 2a multi-center clinical trial of SB 9200 in Canada, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan. The trial is a randomized,
	placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose trial in up to 100 non-cirrhotic patients infected with chronic HBV using doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg of SB 9200 administered daily for 12 weeks. Following this treatment, all patients will
	receive treatment with Viread (tenofovir) for 12&nbsp;weeks. Patients will be sequentially enrolled into one of the four dose cohorts and randomized between a SB&nbsp;9200 dose group or placebo on a 4:1 basis. Patients will be stratified based on
	HBeAg+/- status. HBeAg is a non-structural protein whose presence in blood, or HBeAg+ is indicative of actively replicating virus. Mutant strains of HBV that replicate rapidly without producing HBeAg, or HBeAg-, also exist. The primary endpoint of
	the Phase 2a clinical trial is a reduction in HBV DNA from pre-treatment levels with multiple secondary endpoints including safety and reduction or loss of HBsAg and HBeAg, both of which are important markers of viral replication and early surrogate
	markers for functional cure. We expect to report preliminary results from the first monotherapy dosing cohort of the Phase 2a clinical trial in the first half of 2017 with top line results for all patients treated with SB 9200 by the first half of
	2018.

	We are pursuing the development of the co-formulation of SB 9200 with entecavir and with tenofovir as potential fixed-dose combination
	products for the treatment of chronic HBV patients who may benefit from the combined use of SB 9200 as an immunomodulatory agent, and entecavir or tenofovir, as the antiviral agent. We anticipate that the fixed-dose combination product could result
	in enhanced patient compliance and potentially allow for the delivery of lower doses of the individual compounds for equivalent efficacy and a more favorable safety profile. We have conducted early development work on the co-formulations and believe
	SB 9200 and the antiviral agents are compatible in the same formulation.

	of chronic HBV patients that could increase the percentage of chronic HBV patients that achieve a functional cure. In September 2016, pursuant to this strategy, we entered into an agreement with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Arrowhead, to
	collaborate on the study of the combined use of SB 9200 and Arrowhead&#146;s siRNA product pipeline for the treatment of chronic HBV. Under our collaboration with Arrowhead, we agreed first to study preclinical models with both agents together, with

	We are developing SB 11285, a novel proprietary STING agonist, as a potential immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers.
	Immunotherapy has recently emerged as a transformative approach for the treatment of cancer because the induction of interferons and interferon-stimulated genes in tumor cells and within the tumor microenvironment is essential for modulating the
	host-immune response and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. We plan to develop SB 11285 to potentially be an important addition to the current standard of care in the treatment of various cancers and increase patient treatment responses.

	Recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of STING pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferon
	production and promote an aggressive and strong anti-tumor response. In October 2016, we presented scientific data relating to SB 11285 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Special Conference on Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy.
	We believe that the data we presented at the AACR Special Conference on Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy provide compelling early scientific evidence supporting the further development of SB 11285 as a potential novel immunotherapeutic agent in

	The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60&nbsp;calendar
	days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th&nbsp;day after the FDA&#146;s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional
	information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is
	accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are
	meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for &#147;priority review&#148; are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date.
	For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The FDA may extend the review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for
	three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.

	Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These
	pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will
	not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving
	an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.

	In addition, as a condition of approval,
	the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will
	consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular
	entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or
	dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and using of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The

	Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if the product is intended,
	whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast
	track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#146;s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA
	determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and
	the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the FDA may withdraw the fast track

	Second, in
	2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as &#147;breakthrough therapies.&#148; A product may be
	designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may
	demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough
	therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a
	cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.

	Third,
	the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product designed to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether
	the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial
	reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is
	intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA&#146;s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA
	may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate
	endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on
	irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the
	availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical
	sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a
	measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or
	intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or
	decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional
	post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product&#146;s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4
	or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the
	market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

	order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such

	Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA
	must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also
	determine that the generic drug is &#147;bioequivalent&#148; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#147;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate

	equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#146;s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic

	Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not

	provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of
	the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph&nbsp;IV certification, in which case the applicant
	may submit its application four years following the original product approval.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of
	exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This
	three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a
	previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval
	for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an &#147;orphan drug&#148; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or
	condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000&nbsp;individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States
	for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will
	disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and
	exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or
	condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA
	may not approve another sponsor&#146;s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare
	disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug
	application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically
	superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.

	A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years based on a reevaluation of the
	risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the relevant EU Member State. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State with a consolidated
	version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing
	authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal
	period. Any marketing authorization that is not followed by the marketing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the EU Member State which delivered the marketing authorization within
	three years after authorization ceases to be valid.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Similarly to the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory
	oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related
	regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These rules can impose on central marketing authorization holders for medicinal
	products the obligation to conduct a labor-intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional
	clinical studies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the EU is highly regulated and regulators may shut down
	manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws,
	regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when
	manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. Similarly, the
	distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent
	authorities of the EU Member States.

	In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to EU Member States&#146; laws
	governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and
	promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product&#146;s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities.
	Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at EU level and in the individual EU
	Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on
	our promotional activities with health care professionals.

	Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the EU
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No.&nbsp;847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by
	the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1)&nbsp;a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons
	in the EU when the application is made, or (2)&nbsp;a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions,
	the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant
	benefit to those affected by that condition. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review
	process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees.
	However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the
	manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or
	otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. In addition, the period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated based on available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is
	sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the
	prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion
	of the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Even if our product candidate is approved, sales of our products will depend,
	in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate
	reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once
	coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors
	may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive
	pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be
	considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidate could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of
	operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a drug
	product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be
	available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

	The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign
	governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of
	generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company&#146;s revenue generated from the sale of any
	approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing
	approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

	Outside the United States, ensuring
	adequate coverage and payment for our product candidate will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the
	receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidate or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could
	be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely
	from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug
	candidate to currently available therapies or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for
	which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or
	indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit
	prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the
	severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected
	to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union
	member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical
	products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.

	Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since enactment of the PPACA. For example, in August 2011, the
	Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012
	through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year,
	which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless Congress takes additional action. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of
	2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to
	providers from three to five years.

	Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq Listing Rules requires a majority of a listed company&#146;s board of directors to be comprised of independent
	directors. In addition, the Nasdaq Listing Rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company&#146;s audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent under the Exchange Act.
	Under Rule 5605(a)(2), a director will only qualify as an &#147;independent director&#148; if, in the opinion of our board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in

	member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee: (1)&nbsp;accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2)&nbsp;be an

	determining whether a director has a relationship to such company which is material to that director&#146;s ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, but not limited to:

	Our non-employee director compensation program includes a stock-for-fees policy, under which
	directors have the right to elect to receive common stock in lieu of cash fees. These shares of common stock are issued under our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan. The number of shares issued to participating directors is determined on a
	quarterly basis by dividing the cash fees to be paid through the issuance of common stock by the fair market value of our common stock, which is the closing price of our common stock on the first business day of the quarter following the quarter in
	which the fees are earned. All of our directors have elected to receive shares of our common stock in lieu of cash fees for 2016.

	over a term of one year so long as such person continues to serve as a director. The annual grants are made on the date of our annual meeting of stockholders. These options are granted under our 2015 Plan with exercise prices equal to the fair
	market value of our common stock, which is the closing price of our common stock, on the date of grant and will become immediately exercisable in full if there is a change in control of our company.

	options to purchase 10,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $9.28 per share, and on August&nbsp;20, 2015, upon his election to our board, we granted Kurt Eichler options to purchase 5,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise
	price of $12.88 per share. In each case, such options were granted pursuant to our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2014 Plan. Each of the options granted to Mr.&nbsp;Arkowitz, Mr.&nbsp;Bates and Guy Macdonald was vested as to 37.5% of the shares
	upon grant, vested as to an additional 6.25% of the original number of shares each month thereafter, and were vested in full on January&nbsp;1, 2016. The option granted to Mr.&nbsp;Eichler was vested as to 31.25% of the shares upon grant and vests

	Base salary
</I>
	.&nbsp;We use base salaries to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of all our
	employees, including our named executive officers. None of our named executive officers is currently party to an employment agreement or other agreement or arrangement that provides for automatic or scheduled increases in base salary. For 2015,
	annual base salaries for Mr.&nbsp;Driscoll, Mr.&nbsp;Jensen and Dr.&nbsp;Afdhal were $350,000, $275,000 and $315,000, respectively. Effective as of July&nbsp;1, 2015, Mr.&nbsp;Freve&#146;s annual base salary increased from $185,000 to $225,000. In
	connection with his resignation, we agreed to make severance payments to Mr.&nbsp;Jensen pursuant to a separation agreement entered into with him. See &#147;&#151;Employment Agreements, Severance and Change in Control Agreements&#148; for additional

<I>
	Annual bonus.
</I>
	&nbsp;Our board of directors may, in its discretion, award bonuses to our
	named executive officers from time to time. We typically establish annual bonus targets based around a set of specified corporate goals for our named executive officers and conduct an annual performance review to determine the attainment of such
	goals. Bonuses are based on the achievement of corporate and individual goals. Our management may propose bonus awards to the compensation committee of the board or the board primarily based on such review process. Our board of directors makes the
	final determination of the eligibility requirements for and the amount of such bonus awards. For 2015, Mr.&nbsp;Driscoll and Mr.&nbsp;Freve were eligible for performance bonuses of 30% of their respective base salaries. Based on the achievement of
	corporate and individual goals, for 2015 we awarded a bonus to Mr.&nbsp;Driscoll in the amount of $50,000, representing 143% of his target and pro-rated based on his August 2015 employment commencement date, and a bonus to Mr.&nbsp;Freve in the
	amount of $64,463 representing 96% of his target. Mr.&nbsp;Jensen, who resigned as president and chief executive officer in August 2015, and Dr.&nbsp;Afdhal, who commenced employment in November 2015, did not receive bonuses for 2015.

	Equity incentives.
</I>
	&nbsp;Although we do not have a formal policy with respect to the grant of equity incentive awards to our executive
	officers or any formal equity ownership guidelines applicable to them, we believe that equity grants provide our executives with a strong link to our long-term performance, create an ownership culture and help to align the interests of our
	executives and our stockholders. In addition, we believe that equity grants with a time-based vesting feature promote executive retention because this feature incentivizes our executive officers to remain in our employment during the vesting period.
	Accordingly, our compensation committee and board of directors periodically review the equity incentive compensation of our named executive officers and from time to time may grant equity incentive awards to them. In 2015, we granted
	Mr.&nbsp;Driscoll an option to purchase 295,047 shares of our common stock, Mr.&nbsp;Jensen an option to purchase 18,750 shares of our common stock, Dr.&nbsp;Afdhal options to purchase 150,000 shares of our common stock and Mr.&nbsp;Freve options to
	purchase 50,000 shares of our common stock.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Following our initial public offering in May 2016, our compensation committee conducted a thorough review of all elements of our executive
	compensation program, including the function and design of our equity incentive programs, and evaluated the need for revisions to our executive compensation program to ensure our program is competitive with the companies with which we compete for
	executive talent and is appropriate for a public company. The compensation committee engaged Radford, an AON Hewitt company, to assist with this review.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the compensation committee&#146;s review, effective as of May&nbsp;1, 2016, the annual base salaries for Mr.&nbsp;Driscoll
	and Mr.&nbsp;Freve were increased to $400,000 and $270,000, respectively, and the 2016 annual bonus targets for Mr.&nbsp;Driscoll, Dr.&nbsp;Afdhal and Mr.&nbsp;Freve were set at 50%, 35% and 35%, respectively. Additionally, in May 2016, we granted
	Mr.&nbsp;Driscoll an option to purchase 20,000 shares of our common stock, Dr.&nbsp;Afdhal an option to purchase 5,000 shares of our common stock and Mr.&nbsp;Freve options to purchase 17,209 shares of our common stock.

	use, sell, offer to sell and import certain product candidates comprising a novel phosphorothioate dinucleotide that BioHEP refers to as ORI-9020 and certain related compounds, which include SB&nbsp;9200, SB&nbsp;9400, SB&nbsp;9941 and SB&nbsp;9946,

	granted to BioHEP a warrant to purchase an additional 125,000&nbsp;shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $16.00 per share, which warrant will expire on August&nbsp;1, 2018. Under the license agreement, BioHEP is eligible to receive up to
	$3.5 million in development and regulatory milestone payments for disease(s) caused by each distinct virus for which we develop licensed product(s). BioHEP is also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the low-to-mid single-digits on net product
	sales of licensed products by us and our affiliates and sublicensees, and a specified share of non-royalty sublicensing revenues we and our affiliates receive from sublicensees, which share of sublicensing revenues is capped at a maximum aggregate

	could delay a successful tender offeror from obtaining majority control of our board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential offeror. Pursuant to Delaware law, the directors of a corporation having a classified board may
	be removed by the stockholders only for cause, and pursuant to our restated certificate of incorporation, by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the votes that all stockholders would be entitled to cast in
	an election of directors. In addition, stockholders will not be permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors.

	. Our restated bylaws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of

	undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our board of directors to render

	Exclusive Forum
</I>
	. Our restated certificate of incorporation specifies that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole
	and exclusive forum for: (i)&nbsp;any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation; (ii)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the corporation to
	the corporation or the corporation&#146;s stockholders; (iii)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL; and (iv)&nbsp;any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. We believe this
	provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other
	forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other
	companies&#146; certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our restated
	certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.

	We have
	audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiary (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
	loss, stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
	statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
	States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
	perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
	purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
	disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
	reasonable basis for our opinion.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position

	Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel
	class of therapeutics using a proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid, or SMNH, chemistry platform. Since inception in 2002, the Company built the technology platform and product pipeline using a capital-efficient, semi-virtual business
	model, supported by grants and direct funding from the United States National Institutes of Health (&#147;NIH&#148;) as well as through private financings. In September 2015, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Sperovie Biosciences, Inc.

	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the

	Company believes that its cash resources of approximately $4,347,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2015, together with $8,524,000 of marketable securities at December&nbsp;31, 2015, will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operating plan

	available-for-sale investments at fair value at each balance sheet date and includes any unrealized holding gains and losses (the adjustment to fair value) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders&#146; equity.
	Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers all available evidence to
	evaluate the extent to which the decline is &#147;other than temporary,&#148; including the intention to sell and, if so, marks the investment to market through a charge to the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive

	(&#147;ASC 820&#148;), establishes a hierarchy of inputs used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
	based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company&#146;s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are
	developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value of the investments and is not a measure of the investment credit
	quality. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 1&#151;Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 2&#151;Valuations based on quoted prices

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires
	more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument&#146;s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest
	level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company&#146;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents and marketable securities.

	settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated

	(Topic 606) (&#147;ASC 606&#148;), which amends the guidance for revenue
	recognition to replace numerous industry-specific requirements. ASC 606 implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. ASC 606 also requires
	enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other major provisions include ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing
	estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in ASC 606 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and early adoption is not
	permitted. In July 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of adoption by one year. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently in the process
	of evaluating the effect the adoption of ASC 606 may have on its consolidated financial statements.

<I>
	Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification
	of Deferred Taxes
</I>
	(&#147;ASU 2015-17&#148;), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
	ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (and interim periods within those fiscal years) with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 may be either applied prospectively to all
	deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015. There was no impact as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-17.

	initial public offering or corporate transaction. The Company recorded issuance costs related to cash broker commissions of $925,000 in connection with the December 2014 closing, and $829,000 in connection with the February 2015 closing, which the
	Company recorded as a reduction in proceeds. In addition, the Company issued warrants to purchase 77,081 and 67,238 shares of common stock in connection with the December 2014 and February 2015 closings of the 2014 Financing, which were equity

	In April 2014, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (&#147;the 2014 Plan&#148;). The Company&#146;s 2014 Plan provides
	for the issuance of common stock, stock options and other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants, and advisors. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, the Board had authorized 125,000 and 750,000 shares of common stock to
	be issued under the 2014 Plan, respectively. Awards under the 2014 Plan may include options (incentive and non-statutory), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units or dividend equivalent right, or a combination of them.
	Under the 2014 Plan, the Board, or a committee authorized by the Board, determines the number of shares of common stock to be granted pursuant to the awards, as well as the exercise price and terms of such awards.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The exercise price of incentive stock options cannot be less than the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options awarded under the
	2014 Plan expire 10 years after the grant date, unless the Board sets a shorter term. During 2014, 25,000 shares of common stock were issued to a consultant for services under the 2014 Plan and recognized stock-based compensation expense equal to
	the fair value of the shares issued. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, stock options to purchase 535,797 shares were issued to employees, stock options to purchase 35,000 shares were issued to directors and stock options to purchase
	40,434 shares were issued to consultants under the 2014 Plan. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, 100,000 and 114,519 shares remain available for future grants under the 2014 Plan, respectively.

	No stock options were granted prior to 2015 pursuant to the 2014 Plan. All stock options granted have a ten-year term. The
	fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option pricing model based on the following assumptions: an expected term of six years; expected stock price volatility of 87%; a risk free rate of
	1.4%; and a dividend yield of 0%. The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $8.87. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, all options granted are expected to vest and the weighted-average
	remaining contractual life of all options is 9.6&nbsp;years.

	The board of directors determined the estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s common
	stock on the date of grant based on a number of objective and subjective factors, including third party valuations. As the Company&#146;s stock is not traded publicly, the computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of
	peer companies. The peer companies include organizations that are in the same industry, with similar size and stage of growth. The Company estimates that the expected life of the options granted using the simplified method allowable under Staff
	Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107,

	. The interest rate for grants pursuant to the 2014 Plan is based on the U.S. Treasury bill rates for U.S. treasury bills with terms commensurate with the expected term of the option
	grants on the grant date of the option.

	Because of the Company&#146;s recurring losses since inception, management has concluded that it is more likely than not that
	the benefits of losses to date which result in deferred tax assets will not be realized and, accordingly, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by approximately
	$3,486,000 and $4,399,000 in 2014 and 2015, respectively, due to the increase in the deferred tax assets (primarily due to the net operating loss carryforwards). At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
	carryforwards of approximately $27,636,000 and $27,384,000, respectively available to reduce future taxable income, if any. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2029 and ending in 2035. At December&nbsp;31,
	2015, the Company had available federal and state income tax credits of approximately $333,000 and $39,000, respectively, which are available to reduce future income taxes, if any, through 2035.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on many factors, including the Company&#146;s ability to generate taxable income within the net operating
	loss carryforward period. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Net operating
	loss and tax credit carry-forwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382
	and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual
	limitations is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. The Company has completed several financings since its inception,
	which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or could result in a change in control in the future.

	Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel
	class of therapeutics using a proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid, or SMNH, chemistry platform. Since inception in 2002 and prior to its initial public offering in May 2016, the Company built its technology platform and product candidate
	pipeline using a semi-virtual business model, supported by grants and direct funding from the United States National Institutes of Health (&#147;NIH&#148;) as well as through private financings. In September 2015, the Company formed a wholly owned
	subsidiary, Sperovie Biosciences, Inc.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On May&nbsp;11, 2016 the Company completed its initial public offering of 920,000 shares of common stock at a
	price to the public of $12.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $10.2 million, after underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering-related expenses. In addition, on June&nbsp;3, 2016, the Company issued
	and sold an additional 24,900 shares of common stock at the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share pursuant to the underwriter&#146;s partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, resulting in net
	proceeds of approximately $275,000, after underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering-related expenses. In connection with the initial closing of the initial public offering, the Company received approximately $5.3 million
	in proceeds upon the exercise of previously issued warrants to purchase 641,743 shares of common stock of the Company.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s success is
	dependent upon its ability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates, successfully commercialize approved products, generate revenue, and, ultimately, attain profitable operations.

	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the
	realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses from operations and negative operating cash flows since inception, and expects to incur additional operating losses. The
	Company&#146;s current resources include cash resources of approximately $5,332,000 and marketable securities of $10,313,000 at September&nbsp;30, 2016. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be
	sufficient to allow the Company to fund its current operating plan and continue as a going concern.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets, liabilities (including clinical trial accruals), the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
	reporting period. The Company bases estimates and assumptions on historical experience when available and on various factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing the accompanying
	financial statements related to the fair value of common stock and other equity instruments, accounting for stock-based compensation, income taxes, useful lives of long-lived assets, and accounting for certain accruals. The Company evaluates its
	estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The Company&#146;s actual results may differ from these estimates.

	The Company
	invests excess cash balances in short-term and long-term marketable securities. The Company classifies investments in marketable securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale based on facts and circumstances present at the time of
	purchase. At each balance sheet date presented, all investments in securities are classified as available-for-sale. The Company reports available-for-sale investments at fair value at each balance sheet date and includes any unrealized holding gains
	and losses (the adjustment to fair value) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders&#146; equity. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income
	(expense). If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is &#147;other than temporary,&#148; including the intention to
	sell and, if so, marks the investment to market through a charge to the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

	disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values. ASC 820,
<I>
	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
</I>
	(&#147;ASC 820&#148;),
	establishes a hierarchy of inputs used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are
	inputs that reflect the Company&#146;s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy
	applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported fair value of the investments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 1&#151;Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at
	the measurement date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 2&#151;Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or for which all
	significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Level 3&#151;Valuations that require inputs that reflect the Company&#146;s own
	assumptions that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are
	less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A
	financial instrument&#146;s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company&#146;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
	include cash equivalents and marketable securities.

	Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average
	number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common

	the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock of the Company. Additionally, upon the closing of the initial public offering, all outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s preferred stock automatically converted into 250,000 shares of
	the Company&#146;s common stock. The issuance of these shares resulted in a significant increase in the Company&#146;s shares outstanding, to 7,767,981 shares as of September&nbsp;30, 2016, and weighted average shares outstanding for the three and
	nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, when compared to the comparable prior year period, is expected to continue to impact the year-over-year comparability of the Company&#146;s loss per share calculations through 2017.

	common stock to be issued under the 2014 Plan. Awards under the 2014 Plan may include options (incentive and non-statutory), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units or dividend equivalent right, or a combination of them.
	Under the 2014 Plan, the Board, or a committee authorized by the Board, determines the number of shares of common stock to be granted pursuant to the awards, as well as the exercise price and terms of such awards.

	the 2015 Plan is the sum of 750,000 shares of common stock, plus the number of shares equal to the sum of (i)&nbsp;116,863 shares of common stock, which was the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan that remained available for

	surrendered, cancelled, forfeited or repurchased by the Company at their original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right. The exercise price of stock options cannot be less than the fair value of the common stock on the date of
	grant. Stock options awarded under the 2015 Plan expire 10 years after the grant date, unless the Board sets a shorter term.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This opinion is
	furnished to you in connection with a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
	&#147;Securities Act&#148;), for the registration of an aggregate of 3,830,321 shares (the &#147;Shares&#148;) of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;), of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation
	(the &#147;Company&#148;). All of the Shares are being registered on behalf of certain stockholders of the Company (the &#147;Selling Stockholders&#148;). The Shares consist of 2,032,237 outstanding shares of Common Stock (the &#147;Outstanding
	Shares&#148;) that are held by the Selling Stockholders and 1,798,084 additional shares of Common Stock (the &#147;Warrant Shares&#148;) issuable upon the exercise of warrants (the &#147;Warrants&#148;) that are held by the Selling Stockholders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are acting as counsel for the Company in connection with the registration for resale of the Shares. We have examined signed copies of
	the Registration Statement as filed with the Commission. We have also examined and relied upon minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company as provided to us by the Company, stock record books of the Company as provided to us by the
	Company, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company, each as restated and/or amended to date, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary for purposes of rendering the opinions hereinafter set forth.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our examination of the foregoing documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted
	to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents and the legal competence of all signatories to such documents.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our opinion below, insofar as it relates to the Outstanding Shares being fully paid, is based solely on a certificate of the Chief Financial
	Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company confirming the Company&#146;s receipt of the consideration called for by the applicable resolutions authorizing the issuance of such Outstanding Shares.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We assume that the appropriate action will be taken, prior to the offer and sale of the Shares by the Selling Stockholders, to register and
