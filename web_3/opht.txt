	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapeutics to treat diseases of the back of the eye, with
	a focus on developing therapeutics for age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. AMD is a disorder of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, which is responsible for central vision
	and color perception. There are two forms of AMD, wet AMD and dry AMD. Our most advanced product candidate is Fovista&reg; (pegpleranib), an anti-platelet derived growth factor, or PDGF,
	aptamer that is in Phase&nbsp;3 clinical development for use in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, drugs that represent the current standard of care for the treatment
	of wet AMD. We have completed one Phase&nbsp;1 and one Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of Fovista administered in combination with the anti-VEGF drug Lucentis&reg; (ranibizumab), have
	completed patient enrollment for two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis and expect to complete enrollment in a third Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial
	evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea&reg; (aflibercept) or Avastin&reg; (bevacizumab) in 2016. We have completed enrollment in two additional Phase&nbsp;2a clinical trials of
	Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin), one of which is studying the potential of Fovista to reduce subretinal fibrosis in wet AMD patients and the other
	of which is investigating the optimized regimen of Fovista in combination with anti-VEGF drugs, as well as the potential of Fovista to reduce the treatment burden for wet AMD patients. We are also
	developing our product candidate Zimura&reg; (avacincaptad pegol) as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, a form of dry AMD, as well as in combination
	with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and for the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to anti-VEGF
	monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. We are also investigating the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we
	have an option for a license.

	fibrosis, under the macular region of the retina. The use of anti-VEGF drugs has significantly improved visual outcomes for wet AMD patients compared to untreated patients newly diagnosed with wet

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet
	AMD is the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 55 in the United States and the European Union. The current standard of care for wet AMD is monotherapy administration
	of drugs that target vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, one of several proteins involved in neovascularization. The anti-VEGF market for the treatment of wet AMD consists of two drugs that
	are approved for marketing and primarily prescribed for the treatment of wet AMD, Lucentis and Eylea, and a third drug, Avastin, a cancer drug used on an off-label basis. In 2015, annual worldwide
	sales of Lucentis and Eylea totaled approximately $7.7&nbsp;billion for multiple retinal disease indications, including wet AMD, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (also known as RVO),
	diabetic macular edema (also known as DME) and diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. This sales number does not include sales of Avastin, which is used off-label to treat wet AMD in the United
	States and in the European Union. The anti-VEGF market for the treatment of wet AMD in China includes conbercept, sales of which are also not reflected in the sales number above.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	believe that Fovista's mechanism of action, when administered in combination with an anti-VEGF drug, may result in two relevant biological responses: neovascular regression and
	inhibition of fibrosis under the retina, also known as subretinal fibrosis. Fovista binds to and inhibits a protein known as platelet derived growth factor, or PDGF, causing the stripping of
	pericytes, which are cells that cover the outside of newly formed blood vessels. After the pericytes are stripped from the new blood vessels, endothelial cells lining the inside of the newly formed
	blood vessels are left unprotected and are highly vulnerable to the effects of anti-VEGF drugs. Fovista also inhibits migration of other retinal cells attracted by PDGF, such as retinal pigment
	epithelium, or RPE, cells and glial cells, which play a role in the formation of subretinal fibrosis. We further believe that the administration of Fovista in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in
	patients with wet AMD may cause regression of neovascularization and may inhibit subretinal fibrosis more effectively than anti-VEGF monotherapy. We believe that Fovista may provide meaningful added
	benefit in the treatment of wet AMD regardless of which anti-VEGF drug is administered in combination with Fovista.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	2012, we completed a large Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial in newly diagnosed wet AMD patients in which 1.5 mg of Fovista administered in combination with one of the standard of care
	anti-VEGF drugs, Lucentis, demonstrated statistically significant superiority compared to Lucentis monotherapy based on the primary endpoint of mean change in visual acuity from baseline at
	24&nbsp;weeks. Patients receiving the
	combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis gained a mean of 10.6 letters from baseline on a standardized chart of vision testing compared to a mean gain of 6.5 letters from baseline for patients
	receiving Lucentis monotherapy, representing a 62% comparative benefit from baseline. Based on the pre-specified secondary endpoints in our Phase&nbsp;2b study and on retrospective analyses of
	commonly evaluated parameters used in wet AMD trials, Fovista combination therapy resulted in improved visual outcome, with more patients experiencing vision gain and fewer patients experiencing
	vision loss, in a broad range of patient groups in this trial compared to Lucentis monotherapy. Fovista was generally well tolerated in this clinical trial.

	administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD compared to anti-VEGF monotherapy. Two of these trials, referred to as the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials, are

	Administration, or FDA, for Fovista in combination with Lucentis based upon data from the two Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials and subsequently submit an amendment to the NDA with data from the
	Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, subject to a favorable data outcome from these trials. Alternatively, we may choose to file&nbsp;a supplemental NDA for Fovista in combination with Eylea
	or Avastin following FDA review of the NDA for Fovista in combination with Lucentis. In addition, we continue to evaluate various filing strategies for marketing authorizations in Europe and other

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing our product candidate Zimura for the treatment of patients with GA, a form of dry AMD, and in combination with
	anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD. Zimura is an inhibitor of complement factor C5, which we refer to as C5, a protein that is associated with complement mediated inflammation and cell

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry
	AMD is typically associated with yellow-white dots or deposits under the retina, known as drusen. Unlike in wet AMD, there is an absence of pathological neovascularization in dry
	AMD. Significant vision loss results if dry AMD evolves into GA affecting the macula. GA appears as abrupt and deep levels of macular tissue loss and can be a significant cause of loss of central
	vision, affecting vision in both eyes in most patients. GA results in progressive and chronic degeneration of the retina characterized by variable thinning and dysfunction of retinal tissue.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

	treat this condition. According to a 2011 publication from AMD Alliance International, approximately 30&nbsp;million people worldwide have some form of AMD, with dry AMD accounting for 85% to 90% of
	these cases. A study published in

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple

	of proteins involved in the defense against infection and modulates a variety of immune and inflammatory responses, has a central role in dry AMD. The complement system is generally tightly regulated
	and requires the proper balance of activation and inhibition of proteins to function properly. Poorly regulated or aberrant activation of proteins in the complement pathway without a balanced or
	proportional inhibition of other proteins may result in the stimulation of inflammation and production of proteins, which eventually lead to damage to normal tissue. We believe that excessive

	patients with GA. We did not observe any evidence of drug related adverse events in this clinical trial. We observed a relative trend in this clinical trial, favoring the higher of the two dose
	groups, with respect to the reduction in the mean growth of the GA lesion area, as measured by an independent reading center, at 24&nbsp;weeks. When a reduced dosing schedule was implemented during
	the subsequent 24&nbsp;weeks, weeks&nbsp;24 through 48, this relative trend in reduced growth in GA lesion area was no longer evident. We believe this apparent reduction of growth in GA lesion
	area size when Zimura was dosed with greater frequency compared to less frequent dosing in the same group of patients, may suggest a possible drug effect. Data from third party clinical trials of drug
	candidates targeting the complement pathways have been conflicting.

	ocular adverse events in the study eye which were related to the injection procedure. We performed assessments of visual acuity primarily as safety assessments to detect any decrease in vision
	associated with the intravitreal drug combination or the injection procedure. In a subgroup of 43 patients who had not previously been treated with anti-VEGF drugs and who received six injections at
	doses of 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg of Zimura administered in combination with Lucentis, we observed a mean increase in visual acuity from baseline at all time points based on the number of letters the
	patient can read on a standardized chart of vision testing. In this subgroup, 22 patients (51%) gained at least 15 letters, consisting of six patients (46%) in the 0.3 mg dose group, seven patients
	(47%) in the 1.0 mg dose group and nine patients (60%) in the 2.0 mg dose group.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to expanding our Fovista and Zimura development programs, we are committed to exploring opportunities to
	address the unmet needs in AMD, as well as potentially other indications in the back of the eye. Our strategy, in general, is to be scientifically driven, to evaluate multiple options with limited
	upfront payments and to obtain early proof-of-concept validation prior to a larger commitment of capital. We plan to explore opportunities to expand our product pipeline through in-licensing or
	acquiring the rights to complementary products, product candidates and technologies for the treatment of a range of ophthalmic diseases, principally diseases of the back of the eye. We believe that
	our focus on diseases of the back of the eye and our experienced management and clinical development teams will make us an attractive collaborator or acquirer for companies seeking to out-license or
	sell rights to products, product candidates or technologies in our area of focus. We generally expect that we will not engage in internal early stage research and drug discovery and will thus avoid
	the related costs and risks of these activities. However, we plan to continue to assess opportunities to in-license late-stage preclinical product candidates as well as clinical assets. As an example
	of this strategy, in November 2014, we entered into an exclusive research and option agreement with AVEO Pharmaceuticals to license tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the
	treatment of non-oncologic conditions of the eye. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid AVEO an upfront fee of $0.5&nbsp;million for exclusive rights to investigate tivozanib's potency and
	potential as an ocular formulation. If we elect to continue the development of an ocular formulation of tivozanib, we may exercise our option for an exclusive worldwide license (excluding Asia) for
	the compound for ocular indications upon payment of a license fee and other milestone payments.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our completed Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial, the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis demonstrated statistically
	significant superiority compared to Lucentis monotherapy based on the primary endpoint of mean change in visual acuity from baseline at 24&nbsp;weeks, providing a 62% comparative benefit from

	label with regard to patient and/or lesion characteristics for Fovista for the treatment of patients with wet AMD in combination with anti-VEGF drugs. We believe that Fovista may provide meaningful
	added benefit in the treatment of wet AMD regardless of which anti-VEGF drug is administered in combination with Fovista. We also believe that Fovista, when administered in combination with anti-VEGF
	drugs, has the potential to inhibit neovascularization and the formation of subretinal fibrosis, thereby improving longer-term visual outcomes for wet AMD patients.

	in combination with Avastin or Eylea compared to Avastin or Eylea monotherapy. We believe that Fovista may provide meaningful added benefit in the treatment of wet AMD regardless of which anti-VEGF
	drug is administered in combination with Fovista. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, of the EMA has informed us that, given that Avastin is not approved for intravitreal

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to seek a broad label with regard to patient and/or lesion characteristics for Fovista in combination with anti-VEGF drugs
	for the treatment of patients with wet
	AMD. The anti-VEGF market for the treatment of wet AMD currently consists of Lucentis, Avastin and Eylea. The condition of many patients suffering with wet AMD initially improves through the use of
	anti-VEGF drugs. However, in a substantial portion of cases of wet AMD patients receiving anti-VEGF drugs, the condition of the patient deteriorates over time. For example, based on results of
	third-party clinical trials, after one year of treatment with an anti-VEGF drug, approximately 18% to 22% of newly diagnosed wet AMD patients lost additional vision, defined as the loss of the ability
	to read one or more letters on a standardized chart of vision testing, and approximately 62% to 75% of such patients did not achieve an ability to read an additional 15 or more letters on the

	believe that the administration of Fovista in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in patients with wet AMD may disrupt abnormal new blood vessels and cause neovascular regression more
	effectively than anti-VEGF monotherapy, leading to improved visual outcomes. In addition, based on our initial retrospective assessment of retinal images of patients who experienced vision loss
	following treatment with either 1.5 mg of Fovista in combination with 0.5 mg of Lucentis or Lucentis monotherapy in our completed Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial and a retrospective analysis conducted
	by an independent reading center, as well as results from preclinical tests and our review of recent scientific literature, we also believe that wet AMD patients who receive anti-VEGF monotherapy may
	remain at increased risk for the development of subretinal fibrosis. We believe that the development of subretinal fibrosis in these patients may, in part, be responsible for the deterioration of
	vision that many wet AMD patients experience over time, notwithstanding treatment with an anti-VEGF drug. In May 2015, we completed enrollment in our OPH1005 Fovista Anti-Fibrosis Study and we
	presented interim data from this trial in late 2015. See "&#151;Potentially Expanding the Use of Fovista&#151;Fovista Expansion Studies in Wet AMD" below for a description of the interim

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet AMD is preceded by dry AMD. In a subset of patients, dry AMD converts to wet AMD when new and abnormal blood vessels invade the
	retina. These abnormal new blood vessels originate beneath the retina, in a layer called the choroid, and invade into the overlying retinal layers. This abnormal new blood vessel growth is generally
	referred to as pathological angiogenesis. In the context of wet AMD, pathological angiogenesis is associated with both the development of neovascular cells and the accumulation of other cell types and
	altered tissue. The pathological neovascular tissue in wet AMD is called the choroidal neovascular complex or choroidal neovascularization. Choroidal neovascularization, or CNV, and adjacent and
	contiguous areas of blood and altered tissue are referred to as a lesion.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abnormal
	new blood vessels tend to be fragile and often bleed and leak fluid into the macula, the central most portion of the retina responsible for central vision and color perception.
	Untreated, new blood vessel growth and associated leakage typically lead to retinal distortion and eventual retinal scarring, with irreversible destruction of the macula, resulting in loss of vision.
	This visual loss occurs rapidly with a progressive course. Approximately 90% of wet AMD cases involve subfoveal choroidal neovascularization, which is blood vessel growth directly under the central
	portion of the macula, known as the fovea. Our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista is enrolling patients with subfoveal wet AMD.

	AMD traditionally has been divided into subtypes based on the pattern of the abnormal new blood vessels using the diagnostic imaging technique fluorescein angiography or cross
	sectional location of the abnormal new blood vessels using the diagnostic imaging technique spectral domain optical coherence tomography, or SD-OCT. These subtypes form&nbsp;a continuous spectrum of
	pathological neovascularization based on whether the abnormal new blood vessels are well defined and delineated as determined by fluorescein angiography or whether they have invaded the RPE layer of

	in detecting the presence or absence of neovascularization. However, fluorescein angiography's accuracy in subtype detection can be inconsistent. In addition, the use of fluorescein
	angiography is limited in detecting the location and position of the abnormal blood vessels relative to the RPE due to the variability and subjectivity inherent in the reading of the fluorescein
	angiogram. Currently, there is a shift toward using the latest, high resolution SD-OCT models to image the abnormal new blood vessels and the associated leakage in wet AMD patients. Increasingly,
	retinal specialists, in determining the subtype classification, use SD-OCT to assess whether the presence of abnormal new vessels is located above or below the RPE. Because of technological
	enhancements in SD-OCT machines, the resolution of SD-OCT retinal tissue imaging has increased markedly over the last few years. SD-OCT is the current standard for retinal imaging in the United States
	and the European Union. SD-OCT utilizes specialized light scattering through the biological tissues and obtains high-resolution retinal tissue images using a specialized camera. SD-OCT images show a
	cross-sectional view of the retina that permits enhanced resolution of the space under the retina and at the RPE level where the neovascularization associated with wet AMD is present. SD-OCT images
	allow for a more precise analysis of anatomical differences between various angiographic subtypes of CNV lesions in neovascular AMD, especially with respect to the location of the abnormal new vessels
	relative to the RPE.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	abnormal new blood vessels are made up of "classic" and "occult" components, when assessed by fluorescein angiography. The term "classic" applies to the portion or component of the
	patient's abnormal new bloods vessels or neovascularization that is well defined by fluorescein angiography, with their location usually represented above the RPE. The term "occult" applies to the
	portion or component of the patient's abnormal new blood vessels that is poorly defined by fluorescein angiography, with their location usually represented below the RPE. The quantification of the
	amount of the patient's "classic" or "occult" components with respect to the neovascular lesion determines whether the lesion is "pure classic," "predominantly classic," "minimally classic" or "pure
	occult." The term "pure classic" applies when 100% of the lesion is composed of the classic component. The term "predominantly classic" applies when 50% or greater of the lesion is made up of the
	classic component. The term "minimally classic" applies when less than 50% of the lesion is made up of the classic component. The term "pure occult" or "occult lesions" applies when there is no
	classic component to the lesion and therefore the entire, or 100%, of the lesion is made up of the occult component. Based on enrollment of untreated wet AMD patients in third-party clinical trials,
	the pure occult subtype accounts for approximately 40% of the cases of subfoveal wet AMD in the wet AMD patient population. Some component of occult choroidal neovascularization is present in
	predominantly classic and minimally classic choroidal neovascularization. For example, in minimally classic choroidal neovascularization, as observed through fluorescein angiography, up to 99% of the
	blood vessels may be composed of the occult component, thus only 1% different from 100% or pure occult.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abnormal new blood vessels are predominantly made up of two cell types, endothelial cells and pericytes. The endothelial cells line the inside of abnormal new
	blood vessels. Pericytes then intimately cover the outside of these blood vessels. Early in the process of abnormal new blood vessel formation, VEGF binds to a receptor on endothelial cells and causes
	endothelial cells to proliferate. The proliferating endothelial cells form new blood vessels. VEGF provides survival signals to endothelial cells. VEGF also is one of the most potent inducers of blood
	vessel permeability, which causes the new blood vessels to leak.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current standard of care for wet AMD is administration by intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs as monotherapy. The FDA has
	approved the anti-VEGF drugs Lucentis, Eylea and Macugen for the treatment of wet AMD. The FDA also has approved photodynamic therapy with Visudyne (PDT) as a treatment of patients with wet AMD. In
	addition, although approved by the FDA as a cancer therapy, the anti-VEGF drug Avastin is used off-label to treat wet AMD. Lucentis is an antibody fragment derived from the same full length antibody
	from which Avastin was derived.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucentis
	and Eylea are used primarily to treat wet AMD, although they also are approved for the treatment of other diseases of eye. In 2015, annual worldwide sales of Lucentis and Eylea
	totaled approximately $7.7&nbsp;billion for multiple retinal disease indications, including wet AMD, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (also known as RVO), diabetic macular edema (also
	known as DME) and diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. Lucentis is marketed in the United States by F.&nbsp;Hoffmann-La Roche,&nbsp;Ltd. and outside the United States by Novartis AG. Eylea
	is marketed in the United States by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc. and outside the United States by Bayer AG, except in Asia where it is marketed by Santen
	Pharmaceuticals&nbsp;Co.&nbsp;Ltd. The sales number presented above does not include sales of Avastin, which is used off-label to treat wet AMD in the United States and in the European Union.
	Avastin is approved as a cancer therapy and is marketed solely for such use. However, according to physician prescribing data provided by IMS Health, in 2013, Avastin was used off-label to treat
	approximately 50% of Medicare beneficiaries, and approximately 66% of new-to-therapy Medicare beneficiaries, who received anti-VEGF drugs for wet AMD. In addition, according to information published
	in November 2012 by BioTrends Research Group, retinal specialists in the largest markets in the European Union use off label Avastin to treat approximately 27% of patients with wet AMD. Avastin is
	available through compounding pharmacies and distributors for off-label use to treat wet AMD at a significantly lower price per dose than either Lucentis or Eylea.

	the
	prevalence of both legal blindness and moderate visual impairment in patients two years after being diagnosed with wet AMD have decreased substantially following the introduction of anti-VEGF
	drugs. Nonetheless, the condition of many patients with wet AMD treated with anti-VEGF drugs does not improve significantly and deteriorates in a substantial portion of cases. Moreover, on average,
	improvement in vision through the use of an anti-VEGF drug in the near term is followed by the loss of the initial visual gain over the longer term.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-VEGF
	drugs prevent VEGF from binding to its natural receptor on endothelial cells in the abnormal new blood vessels, thereby inhibiting further abnormal new blood vessel growth and
	leakage associated with wet AMD. There is widespread agreement in the scientific community that the majority of the therapeutic benefit of anti-VEGF drugs is due to reducing or eliminating leakage.
	However, anti-VEGF drugs may be limited in their ability to induce disruption and regression of neovascularization. We believe that the presence of pericytes and their local production of VEGF and
	other factors protect endothelial cells from the effects of anti-VEGF drugs. Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients treated with an anti-VEGF drug eventually exhibit subretinal fibrosis and
	retinal scarring. The eventual development of subretinal fibrosis and retinal scarring in wet AMD patients may limit the impact of anti-VEGF drugs in the longer term. Third-party clinical trial
	results suggest that altering the dose or regimen of anti-VEGF drugs administered for the treatment of wet AMD does not enhance visual outcome. Moreover, third-party clinical trials also suggest that
	visual outcomes for wet AMD patients receiving treatment with an anti-VEGF drug worsen over time and are often associated with the growth of neovascular lesions and the development of subretinal
	fibrosis over time.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing our product candidate Fovista to be administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD.
	Fovista is designed to target PDGF. We believe that Fovista's mechanism of action, when administered in combination with an anti-VEGF drug, may result in two relevant biological responses: neovascular
	regression and inhibition of subretinal fibrosis. We further believe that the administration of Fovista in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in patients with wet AMD may cause regression of
	neovascularization and inhibit subretinal fibrosis more effectively than anti-VEGF monotherapy. We believe that Fovista may provide meaningful added benefit in the treatment of wet AMD regardless of
	which anti-VEGF drug is administered in combination with Fovista. Fovista binds to and inhibits PDGF, causing the stripping of pericytes, which are cells that cover the outside of newly formed blood
	vessels. After the pericytes are stripped from the new blood vessels, endothelial cells lining the inside of the newly formed blood vessels are left unprotected and are highly vulnerable to the
	effects of anti-VEGF drugs. Fovista also inhibits migration of other retinal cells attracted by PDGF, such as RPE cells and glial cells, which play a role in the formation of subretinal fibrosis. Our
	belief that Fovista may inhibit subretinal fibrosis is based on our initial retrospective assessment of retinal images of patients who experienced vision loss following treatment

	on standard of care anti-VEGF monotherapy (54%) were noted to have progression of subretinal fibrosis compared to the Fovista (1.5 mg) combination therapy group (27%). In eyes without any subretinal

	Fovista monotherapy exhibited anti-fibrotic effects in an animal model of retinal scarring. Moreover, more recent scientific publications have reported on the rate of subretinal fibrosis in wet
	AMD patients receiving treatment with an anti-VEGF drug. Based on these preclinical and clinical results, as well as our understanding of the mechanisms of action of anti-VEGF drugs and Fovista, we
	believe that Fovista has the potential to provide meaningful added benefit in the treatment of wet AMD compared to anti-VEGF monotherapy. When administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs, we
	believe Fovista may result in both the inhibition and regression of neovascularization, as well as inhibition of subretinal fibrosis. We believe Fovista's mechanism of action is not dependent on the
	specific anti-VEGF drug regimen with which Fovista is administered.

	an antiseptic solution. By injecting the medication into the vitreous, the physician delivers Fovista in close vicinity to the active disease site with minimal potential for exposure to non-ocular
	tissues. Many other therapies used to treat serious retinal disorders, including Lucentis, Avastin and Eylea, also are administered by intravitreal injection.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have completed one Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial and one Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of Fovista administered in combination with
	Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD. Our pivotal Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program consists of three separate Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials, two of which are evaluating Fovista in combination with
	Lucentis and the other of which is evaluating Fovista in combination with Avastin or Eylea. All three of these Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials incorporate significant aspects from the design of our
	completed Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial. We plan to enroll a total of approximately 1,866 patients in more than 250 centers internationally across the three trials. We completed patient enrollment in
	one of the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials in May 2015 and in the other Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trial in November 2015. We are continuing to actively enroll patients in the Fovista
	Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial and expect to complete enrollment in 2016 based on current enrollment estimates. We expect initial, top-line data from both of the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis
	Trials to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016, with initial, top-line data from the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial to be available in 2017 based on current enrollment estimates.
	If the results of this Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program are favorable, we
	plan to submit applications for marketing approval for Fovista in the United States and, together with our ex-U.S. commercialization partner, Novartis, in the European Union.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, we completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, open label, ascending dose Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and
	tolerability of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of subfoveal wet AMD. We conducted our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial in 23 patients at 11 centers in the United

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients
	enrolled in our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial were 50&nbsp;years of age and older and newly diagnosed with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD with some
	classic component as documented by fluorescein angiography. Although treating physicians typically do not use subtype categorization as a diagnostic tool for choosing among pharmacological agents for
	treating wet AMD, we used the subtype classification so as to include in our trial only wet AMD patients with at least some well-defined abnormal new blood vessels. Since we could image and measure
	the well-defined blood vessels, we believed that we would be able to assess the response of those blood vessels to treatment with Fovista in combination with Lucentis. If we noted regression of
	abnormal new blood vessels or a disruption or change in the density of abnormal new blood vessels, we believed it would support the anti-neovascularization element of our proposed mechanism of action
	for Fovista.

	Normal visual acuity is commonly referred to as 20/20 vision. To qualify for enrollment in our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial, the visual acuity in the patient's study eye had to be between 20/63 and

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this trial, the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis demonstrated
	statistically
	significant superiority compared to Lucentis monotherapy based on the pre-specified primary endpoint of mean change in visual acuity from baseline at the 24&nbsp;week time point. We determined
	statistical significance based on a widely used, conventional statistical method that establishes the p-value of clinical results. Typically, a p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical
	significance. However, when multiple doses of a drug are tested against a single control group, a more stringent statistical method that accounts for multiple comparisons must be applied. For this
	purpose, we used the Hochberg multiple comparison procedure. Under the Hochberg procedure, in order to demonstrate statistical significance for any particular dose, it is necessary to establish a
	p-value that meets a stricter standard than the conventional standard of 0.05 or less unless each dose is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.05 or less. In the case of our Phase&nbsp;2b
	clinical trial, in which we evaluated two doses of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis, the Hochberg procedure required a more stringent p-value of 0.025 or less to establish statistical
	significance for the comparison of the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis to Lucentis monotherapy.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
	24&nbsp;weeks, patients receiving the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis gained a mean of 10.6 ETDRS letters compared to a mean of 6.5 ETDRS letters for patients
	receiving Lucentis monotherapy, representing a 62% comparative benefit from baseline, with a p-value of 0.019. This result was statistically significant. At 24&nbsp;weeks, patients receiving the
	combination of 0.3 mg of Fovista and Lucentis gained a mean of 8.8 ETDRS letters. This result was not statistically significant, having a p-value greater than 0.05, compared to Lucentis monotherapy.
	However, as discussed in more detail below, we believe that the relative visual benefit of the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis compared to the relative visual benefit of the combination
	of 0.3 mg of Fovista and Lucentis at all time points exhibits&nbsp;a dose-response curve in which the response to treatment increases with higher drug concentrations of Fovista. We are not testing
	the combination of 0.3 mg of Fovista and Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy in our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We evaluated measures of visual outcomes as secondary endpoints. Results from secondary endpoints are used to help interpret the
	primary result of the trial and to provide information for future research and clinical development. However, the statistical analysis plan for our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial was not designed to

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We evaluated one measure of anatomical change as a secondary endpoint. Results from secondary endpoints are used to help interpret the
	primary result of the trial and to provide information for future research and clinical development. However, the statistical analysis plan for our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial was not designed to
	establish and, as a result, we could not and did not demonstrate, statistical significance with respect to this secondary endpoint. Accordingly, only descriptive analyses and trends for this secondary
	endpoint are presented below.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean Change in Area of Choroidal Neovascularization from Baseline at 24 Weeks.
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial, the mean change in
	area of
	choroidal neovascularization, or CNV, from baseline at 24&nbsp;weeks as determined by review of fluorescein angiograms was greater in patients treated with Lucentis monotherapy than in patients
	treated with the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis. We believe that the inclusion of both larger and smaller CNV sizes in the single analysis of this secondary endpoint had the potential
	to create a distortion in the analysis of the mean change in area of CNV. This is because the average level of regression, as numerically measured, was approximately tenfold greater in the large CNV
	size patient group compared to the small CNV size patient group. The treatment group with the greater number of patients with larger CNV sizes will show a markedly larger amount of regression on
	average. That was the case in our Phase&nbsp;2b trial in which the Lucentis monotherapy group had a greater proportion of patients with large CNV sizes compared to the group treated with a
	combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis. Therefore, as discussed in more detail below, we performed retrospective analyses by creating subgroups based on the size of CNV at baseline.

	material, or SHRM, that were not pre-specified primary or secondary endpoints in the trial design. Although a retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results can result in the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We performed several retrospective analyses of neovascular regression by
	creating subgroups
	based on CNV sizes. Size of CNV is measured in units called disc area. A disc area is the size of the area of the retina where a standard sized optic nerve emerges. We determined that the mean CNV
	size for all patients in the Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial at baseline was 1.62 disc areas. We created two subgroups of patients based on mean CNV size at baseline. One subgroup of patients, referred
	to as the large CNV size patients, had initial CNV size greater than 1.62 disc areas. The other subgroup of patients, referred to as the small CNV size patients, had initial CNV size of less than or
	equal to 1.62 disc areas.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrospective Analysis of Subretinal Hyper-Reflective Material.
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We performed a retrospective review of SD-OCT images of patients who
	participated in
	the trial without regard to baseline size of choroidal neovascularization. SD-OCT is the imaging technique most widely used today in clinical practice for the evaluation of wet AMD. Unlike fluorescein
	angiograms, SD-OCT images show a cross-sectional view of the retina that permits excellent resolution of the space under the retina and at the RPE-choroid interface where the neovascularization of wet
	AMD is present. The presence of subretinal hyper-reflective material is thought by many experts to indicate the presence of the CNV lesion. The subsequent resolution of subretinal hyper-reflective
	material is thought to correlate with regression of the CNV lesion.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	our retrospective analysis, masked readers trained in the reading of the SD-OCT retinal images assessed the retinal images of patients who participated in the trial for the presence
	of subretinal hyper-reflective material at baseline and at 24&nbsp;weeks. We conducted this retrospective analysis based on the SD-OCT retinal images which were read for each patient group at
	baseline and at week 24. The analysis at week 24 included only patients who completed the study and had SD-OCT retinal images acceptable for analysis.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients
	treated with the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis exhibited greater resolution of subretinal hyper-reflective material from baseline compared to patients treated
	with Lucentis monotherapy. In addition, based on our review of SD-OCT images, patients who experienced a visual gain of more than three lines from baseline at 24&nbsp;weeks and were treated with the
	combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis exhibited greater resolution of subretinal hyper-reflective material from baseline than patients who experienced a similar visual gain and were treated
	with Lucentis monotherapy. The graphs below set forth for each of these two treatment groups the percentage of patients in such treatment group who had subretinal hyper-reflective material at baseline
	and the percentage of those patients who exhibited an absence of such subretinal hyper-reflective material at 24&nbsp;weeks.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrospective Analysis of Subretinal Fibrosis
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of subretinal fibrosis is typically associated with poor visual outcomes in
	wet AMD
	patients. We have undertaken a retrospective analysis of retinal images from patients who had vision loss or lack of visual gain at 24 weeks following treatment with either 1.5 mg of Fovista in
	combination with 0.5 mg of Lucentis or Lucentis monotherapy in our
	Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial to investigate the development of subretinal fibrosis in these patients. Our initial retrospective assessment of retinal images of these patients indicates a reduction,
	on average, in the development and severity of subretinal fibrosis at the 24&nbsp;week time point in patients treated with the combination of 1.5 mg of Fovista and Lucentis compared to patients
	receiving Lucentis monotherapy. We engaged independent third-party retinal experts to review these images to assess the development of subretinal fibrosis in this group of patients. In October 2014,
	findings from an independent subgroup analysis assessing the development and progression of subretinal fibrosis in our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial were presented at the American Academy of
	Ophthalmology annual meeting. This retrospective analysis showed that the mean change in severity of subretinal fibrosis from baseline to conclusion of the study at 24&nbsp;weeks was 0.97 for the
	Fovista (1.5 mg) combination therapy group as compared to 2.0 for the Lucentis monotherapy group (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.003), based on a five-step grading scale developed by Dr.&nbsp;Usha
	Chakravarthy, an internationally recognized key opinion leader. At 24&nbsp;weeks, approximately twice the number of patients on standard of care anti-VEGF monotherapy (54%) were noted to have
	progression of subretinal fibrosis compared to the Fovista (1.5 mg) combination therapy group (27%). In eyes without any subretinal fibrosis at baseline, subretinal fibrosis developed in 10% of
	patients who received Fovista (1.5 mg) combination therapy, compared to 51% of the patients who received monotherapy Lucentis. We believe such findings may provide support for the anti-fibrotic
	element of our proposed mechanism of action for Fovista.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pivotal Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program consists of three separate Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials, two of which are evaluating
	Fovista in combination with Lucentis and the other of which is evaluating Fovista in combination with Avastin or Eylea. We plan to enroll a total of approximately 1,866 patients in more than 250
	centers internationally across the three trials. We completed patient enrollment in one of the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials in May 2015 and in the other Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trial
	in November 2015. We are continuing to actively enroll patients in the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3
	Eylea/Avastin Trial and expect to complete enrollment in 2016 based on current enrollment estimates. We expect initial, top-line data from both of the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials to be
	available during the fourth quarter of 2016, with initial, top-line data from the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial to be available in 2017 based on current enrollment estimates.

	not obligated to comment on our protocols within any specified time period or at all or to affirmatively clear or approve our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program. We submitted the protocols for our
	Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials to the FDA in July 2013. To date, we have not received any comments on the design of our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program from the FDA. The FDA or other regulatory
	authorities may request additional information, require us to conduct additional non-clinical trials or require us to modify our proposed Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program, including its endpoints,
	patient enrollment criteria or selection of anti-VEGF drugs, to continue such program once initiated. In September 2013, the FDA notified us that we have obtained fast track designation for Fovista

	subsequent visual acuity changes after treatment can be compared. The protocols for each of these trials provide that patients be assessed monthly. The administration of treatment varies among the

	have made no meaningful changes to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in these Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials from those we used in our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial. However, we
	have modified the methodology used to determine a patient's eligibility under certain of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials as compared to our Phase&nbsp;2b
	clinical trial. For our Phase&nbsp;2b trial, we assessed patient eligibility based on the fluorescein angiographic pattern of the choroidal neovascular membrane. Since the most commonly employed
	modality for imaging, diagnosing and managing neovascular AMD is currently SD-OCT, we have modified the methodology to determine the patient's eligibility to include SD-OCT criteria. To ensure that
	uniform criteria are applied in characterizing patients' neovascular lesions, we have engaged a centralized reading center to review the SD-OCT, fluorescein angiograms and fundus images of each
	patient's affected eye. Fundus images are photos of the back of the eye taken using a camera attached to a specialized, low-power microscope. These photos, which are often in color, show various
	elements of the back of the eye, including the retina, retinal vasculature, optic disc, macula and fovea. For our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials, the reading center uses all three of these imaging
	modalities, fluorescein angiography, SD-OCT and fundus images, to assess the eligibility of patients based on the presence of abnormal new blood vessels relative to the RPE at the time of enrollment.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treating physicians typically do not use subtype categorization as a diagnostic tool for choosing among
	pharmacological
	agents for treating wet AMD. The process for determining whether or not a wet AMD patient has pure occult choroidal neovascularization has evolved considerably in the United States and European Union
	over the last five years, with SD-OCT replacing fluorescein angiography as the diagnostic standard. There is significant variability and inconsistency among physicians and reading centers with respect
	to the determination of the presence and amount of the occult component of lesions using fluorescein angiography. Different reading centers may categorize a patient differently on the basis of the
	same image if fluorescein angiography is used to assess the occult component of choroidal neovascularization. We believe the use of SD-OCT to assess choroidal neovascularization at the time of
	enrollment in our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials will alleviate some of the variability and inconsistency inherent in using fluorescein angiography. SD-OCT will be used to assess the characteristics
	of abnormal new vessels, which historically, using fluorescein angiography, have been associated with the subtype occult neovascularization. SD-OCT is the current standard of imaging of wet AMD
	patients and we believe that the use of SD-OCT will provide a more precise analysis of the anatomical differences between the various angiographic subtypes of CNV lesions in neovascular AMD.
	Microscopic examination of retinas taken from deceased patients who suffered from choroidal neovascularization shows that abnormal new blood vessels characterized as occult choroidal
	neovascularization using fluorescein angiography have similar morphology to those characterized as classic choroidal neovascularization, including pericyte coverage.

	whether the label for Fovista, if approved, will exclude its use for the treatment of patients who were not primarily enrolled on the basis of SD-OCT assessment. If we determine that the potential
	Fovista label may exclude its use for the treatment of patients with certain SD-OCT criteria, we likely would conduct an appropriate clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of

	enrollment of patients in the trial was based upon investigator discretion and interpretation of the eligibility criteria contained in the protocol. This trial does not have any pre-specified
	efficacy endpoints as it is an uncontrolled, open-label Phase&nbsp;2a study with broad patient eligibility criteria, which typically would not permit an adequate efficacy assessment.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	protocol for this trial requires an initial induction phase of six monthly injections of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin, followed by a
	discontinuous regimen of quarterly administrations of Fovista combination therapy. The protocol permits retreatment with Fovista combination therapy during the intervening monthly visits between
	quarterly administrations if the patient incurs vision loss of at least five ETDRS letters, regardless of any other objective findings. In addition, absent a loss in vision, investigators may decide
	to retreat at monthly visits in between quarterly administrations based upon increases in hemorrhage and/or intraretinal fluid. We completed enrollment in this trial in May 2015 with a total of 101
	patients enrolled. Patients are followed for a 24-month period.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that Fovista combination therapy may allow for less frequent dosing and patient visits compared to anti-VEGF monotherapy,
	thus potentially reducing patient treatment burden. In retrospective analyses of our completed Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of Fovista, we observed that treatment with Fovista combination therapy,
	on average, results in a greater degree of resolution of the choroidal neovascular complex or decreased size of the neovascular tissue in patients with both small and large lesions in wet AMD
	patients, compared to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy. OCT and fluorescein angiography imaging modalities were used to assess these anatomic measures. We believe that the reduction in the size of
	the choroidal neovascular complex could lead to a reduction in the number of cellular elements releasing angiogenic mediators, including VEGF and/or PDGF, which may translate into a reduced need for
	intravitreal injections to achieve similar levels of inhibition of these mediators. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated an open-label Phase&nbsp;2a clinical trial of 1.5&nbsp;mg of
	Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin), to investigate the optimized regimen of Fovista administration in anti-VEGF drugs. In addition, this trial may
	also allow us to evaluate the potential of Fovista to reduce the treatment
	burden for wet AMD patients. We completed enrollment in this trial in October 2015 with a total of 64 patients enrolled. Patients are followed over an 18-month period.

	discontinuous, bimonthly regimen of Avastin monotherapy. We believe that off-label use of Avastin for the treatment of wet AMD has not been extensively studied in randomized, controlled clinical
	trials, similar to those that have been conducted for approved anti-VEGF drugs. Our initial sites for this study are in the Netherlands, where we believe Avastin administered through a discontinuous,
	bimonthly regimen is the current standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. We expect to expand the trial to include additional sites and/or countries.

	Von Hippel-Lindau disease, or VHL, is an inherited disease characterized by multiple benign and malignant tumors and cysts in the eye
	and other organs. Deficiency of the protein "pVHL" in multiple cell types is thought to cause VHL. In the eye, tumors consisting of blood cells called retinal capillary hemangiomas, or
	RCH, are the most common and earliest manifestation of VHL. These tumors cause significant retinal leakage and may lead to significant vision loss. Smaller lesions, located a significant distance from
	the central regions of the retina can be treated by laser or freezing via cryotherapy. However, larger and poorly situated lesions are usually untreatable or have poor visual prognoses. PDGF levels
	have been shown to be elevated in cells with deficiency of pVHL. Therefore, we believe that a combination of Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug may prove beneficial in RCH patients. We plan to supply
	Fovista for a clinical trial conducted by the National Eye Institute, or NEI, which we expect the NEI may initiate in 2016, subject to our reaching agreement with NEI with respect to the trial. VHL is
	rare, and we estimate that there are approximately 5,000 people with the disease in the United States.

	Proliferative vitreoretinopathy, or PVR, is a complication that occurs in approximately 5% to 10% of cases of retinal detachment. It
	is characterized by various degrees of scarring in the retina. In its moderate to severe form, it may become recurrent with a subsequent poor visual outcome. It is usually treated by surgical
	intervention. However, the recurrent form is often untreatable. Local concentrations of PDGF have been shown to be elevated in patients suffering from PVR. In addition, results from animal studies
	indicate that PDGF may play a significant role in mediating PVR related retinal scarring by attracting other retinal cells, such as RPE cells and glial cells, which play a role in scar formation. In
	an animal model of PVR, Fovista strongly inhibited retinal scarring. Therefore, we believe that a combination of Fovista with surgical intervention may prove beneficial in these PVR patients. We are
	considering initiation in 2016 of a clinical trial involving approximately 20 patients with PVR to investigate the potential benefit of Fovista administered in combination with surgical intervention.
	We estimate that there are approximately 5,000 to 10,000 new cases of PVR in the United States each year.

	The Complement Cascade

</FONT>
</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complement cascade consists of a series of proteins involved in the defense of a host body against infectious agents, or pathogens,
	and other foreign proteins. The complement cascade modulates a variety of immune and inflammatory responses to these pathogens and foreign proteins. Under normal circumstances, complement proteins,
	together with antibodies and white blood cells, act beneficially to protect the host body by removing the pathogens and foreign
	proteins, together with other cellular debris. The complement system is generally tightly regulated, achieving the proper balance of activation and inhibition depending on the host body's
	requirements. Poorly regulated or aberrant activation of the complement cascade, without a balanced or proportional inhibition of complement proteins, may result in the formation of
	inflammation-inducing proteins and molecules. These inflammation-inducing byproducts of the complement cascade have the potential to inflict damage to normal tissue known as immune or complement
	mediated damage.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
	the complement cascade can be activated through different pathways, these pathways eventually converge with the generation of an enzyme known as C3 convertase. C3 convertase
	cleaves, or separates, to form&nbsp;a protein called C3, which itself cleaves to from a molecule known as C3b. C3b is an important element of the body's immune response, as it binds to pathogens and
	makes them susceptible to destruction by white blood cells. Subsequent downstream reactions continue after the formation of C3b, with the eventual cleavage of another complement pathway protein known
	as C5. The cleavage of C5 results in the formation of other molecules known as terminal fragments, which are part of the terminal events of the complement pathway. One terminal fragment, known as C5a,
	is a potent mediator of inflammation and induces the release of VEGF from affected cells. The other terminal event is the generation of the membrane-attack complex, or MAC. The cellular response to
	the formation of MAC on affected cells can result in cell damage, cell death and the release of various angiogenic mediators, such as PDGF.

	Zimura may decrease complement mediated inflammation and the release of angiogenic mediators such as VEGF and/or PDGF, thereby providing the rationale as a potential therapy for patients with dry AMD

	primary purpose of the study was to assess safety and tolerability. However, we observed a trend, in favor of the higher of two dose groups, of a relative reduction in the mean growth of the GA lesion
	area, as measured by an independent reading center, at 24&nbsp;weeks. The mean growth from baseline in the GA lesion area during the first 24&nbsp;weeks of the trial, when the injections were

	for the 23 patients receiving the 1.0 mg dose. When the injections were
	administered on a reduced dosing schedule during the subsequent 24&nbsp;weeks, this relative trend in reduced growth in GA lesion area was no longer present. We believe this apparent trend in
	reduction of growth in GA lesion area when Zimura was dosed more frequently, together with the relative loss of the benefit when Zimura was dosed less frequently, may suggest a possible drug effect.
	In addition, data from a third party targeting the complement pathway also exhibited a trend in reduction of GA growth with a pronounced effect in patients with a specific biomarker. Given the safety
	profile of Zimura to date when administered by intravitreal injection, what we believe is a strong preclinical rationale, the trend in the potential benefit that we observed in our Phase&nbsp;1/2a

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase&nbsp;2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura's potential role when
	administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea or Avastin) for the treatment of wet AMD.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	late 2014, we initiated a very small, open-label, Phase&nbsp;2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura's potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the
	treatment of PCV, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy has failed, who we refer to as
	anti-VEGF resistant. Our initial, preliminary analysis of the data from this trial has not revealed any safety concerns related to Zimura.

	Option Agreement for Tivozanib

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to expanding our Fovista and Zimura development programs, we are committed to exploring opportunities to address the unmet
	needs in AMD. Our strategy is to be scientifically driven, evaluate multiple options with limited up-front investment and obtain early proof-of-concept validation prior to a larger commitment of our
	capital. In accordance with this strategy, in November 2014, we entered into an exclusive research and option agreement with AVEO Pharmaceuticals to license tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine
	kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of non-oncologic conditions of the eye. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid AVEO an upfront fee of $0.5&nbsp;million for exclusive rights to investigate
	tivozanib's potency and potential as an ocular formulation. We are solely responsible for the ocular formulation and development of this compound, and we are focusing on a potential treatment for the
	maintenance phase of wet AMD therapy.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
	the agreement, upon completion of our initial analysis, if we elect to continue the development of an ocular formulation of tivozanib, we will pay additional fees based upon our
	submission of an Investigational New Drug application and upon the demonstration of proof of concept in humans. One
	or both of these milestones may be triggered in 2016. If we exercise our option for an exclusive worldwide license (excluding Asia) for the compound for ocular indications, we will pay a license fee,
	and development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, if achieved, as well royalties on commercial sales. We may exercise the option until late 2017.

	AMD. Additionally, the London Project to Cure Blindness, which is a partnership involving the University College London and Pfizer, recently announced a successful pilot procedure for the transplant
	of retinal pigment epithelium cells derived from stem cells for the treatment of wet AMD and the commencement of a broader clinical trial.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, other companies are undertaking efforts to develop technologies to allow for a less frequent dosing schedule for anti-VEGF drugs that are currently in use. If such
	technologies are successfully developed and approved for use, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials of Fovista using a less frequent dosing schedule than the dosing schedule we are
	currently using in our ongoing Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program. Any such trials may not be successful.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of products in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat dry AMD. In general, these product candidates can be
	categorized based on their proposed mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action for these product candidates include inflammation suppression, such as complement system inhibitors and
	corticosteroids, visual cycle modulators, antioxidants and neuroprotectants, cell and gene therapies and vascular enhancers. Based upon publicly available information, we have identified, among
	others, the following ophthalmic product candidates in clinical development that, like Zimura, are based on complement system inhibition:

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is
	generally 20&nbsp;years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent's term may, in certain cases, be
	lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent
	is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or
	the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review
	while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14&nbsp;years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to
	each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar
	provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our
	product candidates, including Fovista, receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending
	upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that
	may be available to us.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2011, we entered into two amended and restated exclusive license agreements with Archemix, one relating to anti-PDGF
	aptamers, which we refer to as the PDGF agreement, and the other relating to anti-C5 aptamers, which we refer to as the C5 agreement. The PDGF agreement superseded a 2004 agreement between Eyetech and
	Archemix that we assumed under the divestiture agreement described above. The C5 agreement superseded a July 2007 agreement between us and Archemix. Under these amended and restated agreements, we
	hold exclusive worldwide licenses (subject to certain pre-existing rights) under specified patents and technology owned or controlled by Archemix to develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale,
	distribute for sale, import and export pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from any anti-PDGF aptamer or anti-C5 aptamer for the prevention, treatment, cure or control of human
	indications, diseases, disorders or conditions of the eye, adnexa of the eye, orbit and optic nerve, other than certain expressly excluded applications.

	based on the product's stage of clinical development at the time we exercise our option, whether the product is a standalone or combination product and whether Novartis exercises an option to
	co-promote such product in the United States. If Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product in the Novartis Territory, we will, subject to specified
	limitations, have the option to terminate the Novartis Agreement,
	convert Novartis's exclusive licenses into non-exclusive licenses, or elect to receive a royalty on sales of such product by Novartis. If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement, Novartis will,

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational
	clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug
	that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to
	the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature and plans for
	clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting
	period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter,
	the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If clinical trials are successful, the next step in the drug development process is the preparation and submission to the FDA of an
	NDA. The NDA is the vehicle through which drug applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. The NDA must contain
	a description of the
	manufacturing process and quality control methods, as well as results of preclinical tests, toxicology studies, clinical trials and proposed labeling, among other things. Every new drug must be the
	subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee and the sponsor of an approved NDA
	is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following
	submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th&nbsp;day
	after the FDA's receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an
	NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the
	submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review
	process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA
	for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for "priority review" are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs
	that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by the FDA for three
	additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
	approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities
	associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g.,&nbsp;active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The
	FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the
	product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the
	benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease,
	expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is an NME.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of
	independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what
	conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the
	manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information
	for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to
	reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to
	reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application
	does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
	the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling,
	require that post-approval studies, including Phase&nbsp;4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug's safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the
	product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market
	and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of
	changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

	the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product's application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after
	preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of
	the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	2012, Congress enacted the Food and Product Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products
	designated as "breakthrough therapies." A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or
	life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant
	endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the
	sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a
	cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or
	effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may
	be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient
	compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and
	resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA's goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based
	upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when
	the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on
	irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products
	granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the
	FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a

	methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are "abbreviated" because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate
	safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved
	under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically,
	in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration,
	the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is "bioequivalent" to the innovator drug. Under the
	statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if "the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug..."
	Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is "therapeutically equivalent" to the RLD in its publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,"
	also referred to as the "Orange Book." Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws
	and numerous health
	insurance programs, the FDA's designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
	the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years
	of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety, which is
	the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may
	not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph&nbsp;IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four
	years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than
	bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A patent claiming a new drug product or its method of use may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent
	term restoration, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term
	extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the
	effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the
	remaining term of a patent past a total of 14&nbsp;years from the product's approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application
	for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of
	the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pediatric
	exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to
	the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or patent protection, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric
	data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is
	deemed to fairly respond to the FDA's request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time
	limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the
	regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which an ANDA or

	Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity

</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an "orphan drug" if it is intended to treat a rare disease or
	condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a
	drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an
	NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten
	the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
	a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare
	disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor's marketing
	application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare
	disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader
	than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a
	subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution
	to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the
	extent it chooses to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory
	authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug in the European
	Union, a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in
	Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical

	will become applicable no earlier than 28&nbsp;May 2016. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new legislation aims at
	simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be
	required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether
	the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting

	the European Union, the advertising and promotion of products are subject to EU Member States' laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading
	and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products.
	These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product's Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent
	authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the
	European Union. The applicable laws at the European Union level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. These
	laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with health care professionals.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included
	in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in
	the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a
	company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for
	some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant
	waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing
	marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing
	authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the Centralized Procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in
	the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary
	Protection Certificate, or SPC.

	condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2)&nbsp;a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic
	condition in the European Union and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no

	with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient
	quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the
	original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan

	and
	reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to
	which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and
	establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or
	reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing
	the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a
	formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate
	the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA
	or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate
	could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor's decision to provide
	coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors
	will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown
	significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price
	controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company's revenue generated from the sale
	of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for
	which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside
	the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in
	many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the
	cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has
	been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so called health
	technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their
	national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may
	instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products,
	but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions.

	Recently,
	many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare
	expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly
	prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate
	pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade,
	i.e.,&nbsp;arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for
	pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other
	legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011,
	among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion
	for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic
	reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in
	effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further
	reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover
	overpayments to providers from three to five years.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our product candidates, Fovista and Zimura, are in clinical development. We expect our expenses to continue to increase, particularly as we continue the
	development of Fovista in our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program, as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through
	the Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as we pursue the development of Zimura through our Zimura development programs.
	We expect our expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already commenced. We also expect our expenses to increase as we manufacture
	validation batches of API and drug product for Fovista. In addition, our expenses will increase prior to obtaining marketing approval for Fovista as we expand our commercial infrastructure and
	build-up our Fovista API supply to support the anticipated launch of Fovista. Furthermore, if we obtain marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate that we may develop, we
	expect our commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing to increase significantly. For Fovista, our ex-U.S. commercialization partner Novartis is
	responsible for these commercialization expenses outside the United States. We are party to agreements, specifically a divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech),&nbsp;Inc., which agreement is now
	held by OSI Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;LLC, a subsidiary of Astellas US,&nbsp;LLC, and license agreements with Archemix Corp., or Archemix, and Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, that impose significant
	milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and Zimura. For example, in connection with
	our entry into the Novartis Agreement, we made a milestone payment of $19.8&nbsp;million to Nektar in June 2014. We are also exploring the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib,
	a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option to obtain a license, and expect our expenses to increase as we continue the preclinical development of this compound,
	including in the event we elect to exercise our option or in the event we trigger certain milestone payment obligations.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $391.9&nbsp;million. We also had
	$368.9&nbsp;million in total liabilities, $338.1&nbsp;million of which related to the Novo Agreement and deferred revenue associated with the Novartis Agreement.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the potential remaining $30.0&nbsp;million enrollment-based milestone payment under the Novartis
	Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements as currently planned through the end of 2017. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be
	wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including the success of our development and
	commercialization of our product candidates and whether we pursue the acquisition or in-licensing and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies. For example, our expenses
	may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials. Our expenses may also exceed our expectations if we increase our
	investigator fees for our clinical trials or if we further expand the scope of our clinical trials and programs, including, for example, by increasing the number of clinical trial sites or changing
	the geographic mix of sites at which patients are enrolled. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing validation, process
	development, the scale-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development
	activities or corporate staffing. If we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to
	perform clinical or nonclinical trials or other studies in addition to those we currently expect to conduct, or if there are any delays in completing the clinical trials of Fovista or Zimura, or the
	development of any of other product candidates that we may develop, our expenses could increase. As a result, we may need or may seek to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing
	operations prior than expected.

	Although we expect to have initial top-line data from the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial in 2017, the timing of the availability of such data is dependent, in part, on our ability to
	locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients and may be subject to particular variability. Avastin is not approved for intravitreal use in treating wet AMD, and regulatory authorities in
	certain countries may not allow, or physicians and patients may choose not to participate in, a clinical trial in which Avastin is administered in combination with Fovista for the treatment of wet
	AMD. Even if we ultimately obtain statistically significant, positive results from our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program, it is possible that such data may not be clinically relevant.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial commenced nine months later than the two Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials. We will not have data from our Fovista Phase&nbsp;3
	Eylea/Avastin Trial at the time data from the other two Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials becomes available. We may nonetheless decide to proceed with submitting applications for marketing
	approval for Fovista administered only in combination with Lucentis, or we may choose to delay our application for marketing approval until
	data from all three Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials are available. We plan to initially submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA for Fovista in combination with Lucentis based upon data from
	the two Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials and subsequently submit an amendment to the NDA with data from the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, subject to a favorable data outcome from
	these trials. Alternatively, we may choose to file&nbsp;a supplemental NDA for Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin following FDA review of the NDA for Fovista in combination with Lucentis.
	If we determine to delay seeking approval of Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin pending regulatory action on our applications for Fovista in combination with Lucentis, the FDA or other
	regulatory authorities could defer taking action on our applications while data remain outstanding from the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial. Furthermore, although we may wish to amend our
	applications for marketing approval once we have data available from the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, the FDA may not accept such an amendment. Moreover, if we subsequently amend our
	applications for marketing approval when data from the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial become available, we may experience further delays in our application process. The manner and timing
	in which we and our ex-U.S. commercialization partner, Novartis, seek marketing approval for Fovista may differ in the United States and in the European Union.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	expect that our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials and the Fovista Expansion Studies will continue in accordance with their protocols after we submit applications for marketing approval,
	and the conclusions of those trials may yield data that are inconsistent with the initial data used to support our applications. We are also supplying Fovista for third-party sponsored clinical
	trials. In addition, Novartis may commence additional preclinical and clinical trials for Fovista including those that it deems necessary for regulatory approval and/or pricing reimbursement outside
	of the United States. Adverse safety events or negative or inconclusive efficacy results in any of these trials may impact the progress of our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program, including our ability to
	receive marketing approval, and, if such data are received following a potential approval, our future sales of Fovista. As a result of these and other factors, we cannot accurately predict when or if
	Fovista will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before obtaining approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must conduct extensive clinical trials
	to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to
	outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical
	trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying
	interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fovista
	administered in combination with Lucentis was generally well tolerated in our Phase&nbsp;1 and Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trials. However, the results of these clinical trials
	may not be predictive of the results of our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista. We have clinical data for Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis from only these two studies with a
	limited follow-up of a maximum of 24&nbsp;weeks. As compared to our Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial, our three Phase&nbsp;3 trials are longer in duration (24&nbsp;months) with a 12-month time
	point for the primary endpoint, have a greater number of patients (approximately 1,866), have a greater number of sites (more than 250), which encompass a much larger geographical recruitment area,
	and result in chronic exposure to a higher rate of intraocular pressure due to an increased injection volume. Consequently, there is potential for an increase in cumulative side effects resulting from
	two separate intravitreal injections and increased intraocular pressure in the Fovista combination therapy patients as compared to the patients receiving monotherapy anti-VEGF treatment and there is a
	much longer duration of therapy and greater geographic diversity of patients in our Phase&nbsp;3 trials. This increase in the number of intravitreal injections and treatment burden, increased
	variability of patient care due to the larger number of clinical trial sites and the broader genetic profile of the enrolled patients from a larger geographic region may result in increased
	susceptibility to side effects of Fovista and/or resulting from the treatment procedure. Therefore, there is the potential for an unfavorable safety and tolerability profile in the Fovista combination
	therapy arm of the study as compared to our Phase&nbsp;2b study and monotherapy anti-VEGF studies which may be
	reflected in an increase in adverse events and/or serious adverse event rates (either ocular, systemic or both) in patients receiving Fovista combination therapy. For example, there may be, among
	others, an increase in the rates of intraocular infections, or endophthalmitis, intraocular pressure, glaucoma, retinal tears, cataracts, retinal detachment, intraocular inflammation, retinal and/or
	choroidal circulation compromise, cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarctions, stroke, blood clots or emboli, or hospitalizations in the Fovista combination therapy patients.

	have a greater number of sites (more than 250), which encompass a much larger geographical recruitment area, and result in chronic exposure to a higher rate of intraocular pressure due to an increased
	injection volume. Consequently, there is potential for an increase in cumulative side effects resulting from two separate intravitreal injections and increased intraocular pressure in the Fovista
	combination therapy patients as compared to the patients receiving monotherapy anti-VEGF treatment and there also is a much longer duration of therapy and greater geographic diversity of patients in
	our Phase&nbsp;3 trials. This increase in the number of intravitreal injections and treatment burden, increased variability of patient care due to the larger number of clinical trial sites and the
	broader genetic profile of the enrolled patients from a larger geographic region may result in increased susceptibility to side effects of Fovista and/or resulting from treatment procedure. Therefore
	there is the potential for an unfavorable safety and tolerability profile in the Fovista combination therapy arm of the study as compared to our Phase&nbsp;2b trial and monotherapy anti-VEGF trials
	which may be reflected in an increase in adverse events and/or serious adverse event rates (either ocular, systemic or both) in patients receiving Fovista combination therapy. For example, there may
	be, among others, an increase in the rates of intraocular infections, or endophthalmitis, intraocular pressure, glaucoma, retinal tears, cataracts, retinal detachment, intraocular inflammation,
	retinal and/or choroidal circulation compromise, cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarctions, stroke, blood clots or emboli, or hospitalizations in patients in the Fovista combination
	therapy arm of each trial.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	addition, we have very limited clinical and safety data with respect to the effects of Fovista administered in combination with intravitreal injections of either Eylea or Avastin. The
	safety results of our trials are dependent, in part, on the safety and tolerability of the anti-VEGF drug(s) administered in combination with Fovista. Avastin is not approved for the treatment of wet
	AMD, and according to some third party clinical trials, may be associated with a greater risk of serious adverse events or undesirable side effects as compared to Lucentis.

	API for both Fovista and Zimura and a different, single third-party manufacturer to provide fill-finish services for both Fovista and Zimura. Other than our agreements with Agilent Technologies with
	respect to our clinical and commercial supplies of Fovista API, all of our manufacturing arrangements are on a purchase order basis. In order to obtain regulatory approval for Fovista or Zimura, these
	third-party manufacturers will be required to consistently produce the API used in Fovista or Zimura in commercial quantities and of specified quality or execute fill-finish services on a repeated
	basis and document their ability to do so. This is referred to as process validation. If the third-party manufacturers are unable to satisfy this requirement, our business will be materially and

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	third-party manufacturer of API for Fovista and Zimura has made only a limited number of batches of Fovista and Zimura to date. Fovista API has been manufactured at commercial scale
	only on a limited basis, and Zimura API has never been manufactured at commercial scale. Although we have produced commercial scale batches of Fovista API, these batches were not produced using PEG
	reagent produced at a commercial scale, which we are in the process of validating. The regulatory requirement to complete process validation has not yet been satisfied for either product candidate.
	These manufacturing processes and the facilities of our third-party manufacturers, including our third-party API manufacturer and our third-party manufacturer providing fill-finish services, are
	subject to inspection and approval by the FDA before we can commence the commercial manufacture and sale of Fovista or Zimura, and thereafter on an ongoing basis. Our third-party API manufacturer has
	undergone only one Pre-Approval Inspection by the FDA. Our third-party manufacturer providing fill-finish services is subject to FDA inspection from time to time. Failure by our third-party
	manufacturers to pass such inspections and otherwise satisfactorily complete the FDA approval regimen with respect to our product candidates may result in regulatory actions such as the issuance of
	FDA Form&nbsp;483 notices of observations, warning letters or injunctions or the loss of operating licenses. Additionally, on October&nbsp;22, 2014, the FDA issued its final guidance on the
	circumstances that constitute delaying, denying, limiting or refusing a drug inspection pursuant to Section&nbsp;707 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012. If any of
	our third-party manufacturers are found to have delayed, denied, limited or refused a drug inspection, our API or drug product could be deemed adulterated. Based on the severity of the regulatory
	action, our clinical or commercial supply of API or our fill-finish services could be interrupted or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

	issues relating to the manufacturing processes or the quality, purity and stability of the product, and we may be required to refine or alter our manufacturing processes to address these issues.
	Resolving these issues could result in significant delays and may result in significantly increased costs. If we underestimate the demand for an approved product, given the long lead times required to

	addition, the potential market opportunity for Fovista is difficult to estimate precisely. If Fovista receives marketing approval for the treatment of wet AMD, it will be approved
	solely for use in combination with an anti-VEGF drug. The market opportunity for Fovista will be dependent upon the continued use of anti-VEGF drugs in the treatment of wet AMD and the market share of
	such anti-VEGF drugs for which Fovista is approved as a combination therapy. In addition, because physicians, patients and third-party payors may be sensitive to the addition of the cost of Fovista to
	the cost of treatment with anti-VEGF drugs, we may experience downward pressure on the price we can charge for Fovista.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program enrolls patients based on a specific definition of the presence of neovascularization with certain characteristics, including the presence of
	subretinal hyper-reflective material, or SHRM, using the commonly employed modality of spectral domain optical coherence tomography, or SD-OCT. We are not aware of any third-party clinical trials that
	have used this criteria to assess patient inclusion and as such do not know the proportion of total cases of subfoveal neovascularization that are represented using this specific definition of SD-OCT
	inclusion criteria. However, a recent third-party retrospective analysis based on a treatment na&iuml;ve wet AMD population with relatively broad entry criteria in a National Eye Institute
	sponsored study showed that approximately 77% of patients in that study demonstrated the presence of SHRM. We cannot easily assess the impact on the potential market opportunity for Fovista should
	Fovista receive marketing approval and the approved label exclude patients based on this criteria.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program provides for a 30-minute delay in the injection of Fovista after the anti-VEGF drug to minimize the risk in our clinical trials of an unacceptable
	increase in intraocular pressure as a result of the amount of the two agents injected. If Fovista receives marketing approval for the treatment of wet AMD and the approved label requires such a
	waiting period, the potential market
	opportunity for Fovista may be limited to the extent that physicians and patients find such a waiting period unacceptable.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to Fovista and

	for this indication. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and
	establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the
	same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. We also will face similar competition with respect to any other products or product candidates that we may

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a company, we have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. We currently do not have any
	sales or distribution infrastructure and have only a limited number of marketing personnel. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales, marketing and
	distribution organization or outsource those functions to third parties. If Fovista receives marketing approval, we plan to
	commercialize it in the United States with our own specialty sales force targeting retinal specialists. Pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, we have granted to Novartis the exclusive right to
	commercialize Fovista outside of the United States in consideration for royalties on any such sales.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country.
	Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval
	of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets,
	prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a
	particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our or any commercialization partner's commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively
	impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates,

	candidate successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities,
	private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will
	pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A major trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors, particularly Medicare, have
	attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with
	predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for Fovista, Zimura or any
	other product that we commercialize or any commercialization partner commercializes on our behalf, and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimbursement
	may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products
	may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician and because, in the case of Fovista, our drug will be
	administered in combination with other drugs that may carry high prices. In addition, physicians, patients and third-party payors may be sensitive to the addition of the cost of Fovista to the cost of
	treatment with anti-VEGF drugs. We or any commercialization partner may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement
	relative to other therapies, including in the case of Fovista, relative to monotherapy with anti-VEGF drugs. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only
	to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.

	ordered. In the event either of these suppliers breaches its supply obligations as specified in the
	applicable agreement, such supplier has agreed to enable a third-party manufacturer, if one is available, to supply us with PEG reagent and Fovista API, as applicable. In the case of Nektar, this
	alternative supply would last only until Nektar demonstrates that Nektar has the ability to supply all of our requirements for PEG reagent. The agreements of Nektar and Agilent to enable a third-party
	manufacturer may be difficult to enforce in the context of a breach by either of these suppliers of their supply obligations. In particular with respect to the potential replacement of Nektar, we may
	not be able to reach an agreement with any third-party manufacturer to take on the supply of PEG reagent under such circumstances because, to our knowledge, no third party currently manufactures the
	PEG reagent we currently use in making the Fovista API for use in any other FDA approved drug. Furthermore, with respect to the potential replacement of Nektar, the replacement manufacturer's right to
	supply us with PEG reagent would be subject to termination at any time once Nektar demonstrates that Nektar has the ability to supply all of our requirements for PEG reagent, which may limit the
	interest of potential third-party manufacturers in undertaking such an engagement. In addition, in the case of the potential replacement of either Nektar or Agilent, the process of transferring any
	necessary technology or process to a third-party manufacturer would entail significant delay in or disruption to the supply of PEG reagent or Fovista API, as applicable, and, as a result, a
	significant delay in or disruption to the manufacture of Fovista. Furthermore, the FDA or other regulatory authorities might require additional studies to demonstrate, in the case of a replacement of
	Nektar, equivalence between the Fovista API made using the Nektar PEG reagent and the Fovista API made using any replacement PEG reagent we propose to use or between the Nektar PEG reagent itself and
	any replacement PEG reagent we propose to use to make Fovista, or, in the case of a replacement of Agilent, equivalence between the Fovista API made by Agilent and the Fovista API made by the
	alternative manufacturer. We ultimately may be unable to demonstrate such equivalence.

	and Nektar that we depend on for rights to Fovista, Zimura and other product candidates and technology. These agreements impose, and we may enter into additional licensing arrangements or other
	agreements with third parties that may impose, diligence, development and commercialization timelines, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. Under our divestiture
	agreement with OSI Pharmaceuticals and our licensing agreement with Nektar, we are obligated to pay royalties on net product sales of Fovista or
	other product candidates or related technologies to the extent they are covered by the agreement. Under our license agreements with Archemix and Nektar, we would not be able to avoid our payment
	obligations even if we believed a licensed patent right was invalid or unenforceable because the license agreements provide that our licenses to all licensed patent rights would terminate if we
	challenge the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent right.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	also have diligence and development obligations under our divestiture agreement with OSI Pharmaceuticals and our license agreements with Archemix and Nektar. Generally, these
	diligence obligations require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, seek regulatory approval for and commercialize our products in the United States, the European Union and, in some
	cases, certain other specified countries. Although the Novartis Agreement provides that Novartis will be responsible for performing certain of these obligations with respect to specified countries for
	Fovista, we still remain liable under our agreements with OSI Pharmaceuticals, Archemix and Nektar. If we fail to comply with our obligations under current or future acquisition, license and funding
	agreements, or otherwise breach an acquisition, license or funding agreement as a result of our own actions or inaction or the actions or inactions of our commercialization or collaboration partners,
	our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not have the rights or the financial resources to develop, manufacture or market any product that is
	covered by these agreements. Such a failure to comply or breach by us under any of these agreements could also lead to a breach by us of the Novartis Agreement. Our counterparties also may have the
	right to convert an exclusive license to non-exclusive in the territory in which we fail to satisfy our diligence obligations, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product
	candidate being developed under any such agreement. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or
	restated agreements with less favorable terms, seek alternative sources of financing or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to Fovista, Zimura and other important
	intellectual property or technology. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from commercializing Fovista, Zimura or other product candidates we may develop, which could have a material adverse effect

	addition to the above risks, certain of our intellectual property rights are sublicenses under intellectual property owned by third parties, in some cases through multiple tiers. The
	actions of our licensors may therefore affect our rights to use our sublicensed intellectual property, even if we are in compliance with all of the obligations under our license agreements. For
	example, the licenses from Archemix include sublicenses to us of rights to specified technology, which we refer to as the SELEX technology, licensed by University License Equity Holdings,&nbsp;Inc.
	to Gilead Sciences,&nbsp;Inc., or Gilead, and sublicensed by Gilead to Archemix, as well as other technology owned by Gilead and licensed to Archemix. In addition, the licenses we have obtained from
	Nektar include sublicenses of certain rights. Should our licensors or any of their upstream licensors fail to comply with their obligations under the agreements pursuant to which they obtain the
	rights that are sublicensed to us, or should such agreements be terminated or amended, our ability to develop and commercialize Fovista, Zimura and other product candidates may be materially harmed
	and could also lead to a breach by us of the Novartis Agreement. While the applicable agreements may contain contractual provisions that would in many instances protect our rights as a sublicensee in
	these circumstances, these provisions may not be enforceable and may not protect our rights in all instances. Further, we do not have the right to control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement
	of all of our licensed and sublicensed intellectual property, and even when we do have such rights, we may require the cooperation of our licensors and their upstream licensors, which may not be
	forthcoming. Our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to prosecute, maintain and enforce our licensed and sublicensed intellectual property effectively.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of
	much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the
	patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent
	applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18&nbsp;months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our
	licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of
	such inventions. Moreover, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, might require that the term of a patent issuing from a pending patent application be disclaimed and limited to the term of
	another patent that is commonly owned or names a common inventor. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, term, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.

	protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of any patent
	application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our or their ability to generate additional preclinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our
	proposed claims. We or any collaboration or commercialization partner may not be able to generate sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent
	patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.
	On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These
	include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation and switch the U.S. patent system from a "first-to-invent" system to a
	"first-to-file" system. Under a first-to-file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file&nbsp;a patent application generally will be entitled to
	the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the
	Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013.
	Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties
	and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
	condition.

	AMD with Fovista in combination with Avastin or Lucentis, which is expected to expire in 2024. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a
	patent restoration term of up to five years as partial compensation for patent term effectively lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process occurring after the issuance of a
	patent. We may be able to obtain a patent term extension for this U.S. patent, and we expect such extension to be for approximately three years. The European patent rights covering the composition of
	matter of Fovista are expected to expire in 2018. Such expiration date is shortly after the date by which we expect Fovista to be commercialized in Europe, and may even be prior to such date. We own a
	granted European patent covering a combination of Fovista and Lucentis or Avastin for use in a method for treating wet AMD. This European patent is expected to expire in 2024. Similar to the patent
	term restoration available in the United States, the regulatory framework in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions provides the opportunity to extend the term of a patent that
	covers an approved drug in certain circumstances. Notwithstanding the availability of patent term extension or restoration provisions, we may not be granted patent term extensions because of, for
	example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time
	period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term or scope of any such extension is less than
	we request, any period during which we have the right to exclusively market our product will be shorter than we would otherwise expect, and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products

	and may not result in patents being issued which protect the use of Fovista in combination with Eylea for treating wet AMD or effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies
	and products. If a patent is granted following prosecution of any such application, the latest projected patent expiry, absent any patent term adjustment or extension or patent restoration, would be

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method-of-treatment
	patents are more difficult to enforce than composition-of-matter patents because of the risk of off-label sale or use of a drug for the patented method. The FDA does
	not prohibit physicians from prescribing an approved product for uses that are not described in the product's labeling. Although use of a product directed by off-label prescriptions may infringe our
	method-of-treatment patents, the practice is common across medical specialties, particularly in the United States, and such infringement is difficult to detect, prevent or prosecute. Off-label sales
	of other products having the same API as Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidates we may develop would limit our ability to generate revenue from the sale of Fovista, Zimura or such other
	product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. In addition, European patent law generally makes the issuance and enforcement of patents that cover methods of treatment of the human body
	difficult. Further, once the composition-of-matter patents relating to Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate in a particular jurisdiction, if any, expire, competitors will be able to make,
	offer and sell products containing the same API as Fovista, Zimura or such other product candidate in that jurisdiction so long as these competitors do not infringe any other of our patents covering
	Fovista's or Zimura's composition of matter or method of use or manufacture, do not violate the terms of any marketing or data exclusivity that may be granted to us by regulatory authorities and
	obtain any necessary marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities. In such circumstances, we also may not be able to detect, prevent or prosecute off-label use of such competitors'
	products containing the same API as Fovista or Zimura in combination with any anti-VEGF drug, even if such use infringes any of our method-of-treatment patents.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

	manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or importation is solely for uses that are reasonably related to development of information that could be submitted to the FDA. For this reason, our competitors
	might be able under certain circumstances to perform activities within the scope of the U.S. patents that we own or under which we are licensed without infringing such patents. This might enable our
	competitors to develop during the lifetime of these patents drugs that compete with Fovista or Zimura, if approved.

	U.S. patent rights covering Zimura as a composition of matter are expected to expire in 2025. Such expiration date may be prior to the date by which we would be able to commercialize
	Zimura in the United States if we seek and obtain marketing approval. The U.S. patent rights covering methods of treating certain complement protein mediated disorders with Zimura are expected to
	expire in 2026. As a result, if we obtain marketing approval for Zimura, we may not be able to exclude competitors from commercializing products similar or identical to ours if such competitors do not
	use or promote our claimed methods of treatment or do use or promote our methods of treatment after our patents expire. Depending on potential delays in the regulatory review process for Zimura, we

	similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Even if our owned or licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue with a scope broad enough to provide

	exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to prevent others from using or
	commercializing similar or identical technology and products or from launching generic versions of our products, or could limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products.
	The launch of a generic version of one of our products in particular would be likely to result in an immediate and substantial reduction in the demand for our product, which could have a material
	adverse effect on our business. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before

	infringement or other violations, we may be required to file claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any such claims could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us,
	including claims alleging that we infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one or more of the patents we
	assert is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent's claims narrowly or refuse to prevent the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents
	do not cover the technology. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable or that the party against whom we
	have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In such a case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such marks. In any intellectual property litigation,
	even if we are successful, any award of monetary damages or other remedy we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure
	to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market Fovista, Zimura or any
	other product candidate from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to
	rely upon third-party CROs and Novartis to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to
	regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate's safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the
	product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authorities. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that Fovista, Zimura or any
	other product candidate that we may develop is not effective, is only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our
	obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. The FDA or other regulatory authority may limit the approval of Fovista to use with only specified anti-VEGF drugs rather than with all
	anti-VEGF drugs. Such limitation could limit sales of Fovista.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based
	upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the
	enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory
	authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical,
	clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any
	marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing
	approval of novel product candidates such as Fovista and Zimura manufactured using novel manufacturing processes can be more expensive and take longer than for other, more
	well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to regulatory agencies' lack of experience with them. We believe that the FDA has only granted marketing approval
	for one aptamer product to date. This lack of experience may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead
	to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more
	rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other
	government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to
	generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Moreover, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and
	promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be
	changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA's approval
	process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us and any collaborators to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.

	As previously disclosed in July 2015, our management concluded that we experienced a material weakness in internal controls related to technical accounting expertise over the accounting for deferred
	tax assets and income tax accounting in general during certain prior financial reporting periods. The deficiency in the application of our controls relating to technical accounting expertise over the

	in internal control over financial reporting was fully remediated as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Although we have remediated this deficiency in internal control over financial reporting, we cannot be
	certain that the remedial measures that we have taken will ensure that we maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting in the future and, accordingly, additional material weaknesses could
	occur or be identified. Any additional material weaknesses or combination of deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, and
	the current and future deficiencies may impact investors' confidence in our internal controls and our company, which could cause our stock price to decline.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party contractors maintain sensitive data on our and their respective
	networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our clinical trial participants and business partners. In
	particular, we rely on contract research organizations and other third-parties to store and manage information from our clinical trials, including our Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program. The
	secure maintenance of this sensitive information is critical to our business and reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party
	contractors are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. In particular, we
	believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of
	sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems or those of our
	third-party contractors. For information stored with our third-party contractors, we rely upon, and the integrity and confidentiality of such information is dependent upon, the risk mitigation efforts
	such third-party contractors have in place. In the recent past, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our and our third-party contractors' respective
	network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or
	immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. System failures, data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could
	compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. System failures or accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a
	material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. A data security breach
	could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our clinical trial patients and others. Cyber-attacks could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development
	delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval
	efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications,
	or inappropriate public disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a public company, we incur and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a
	private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select Market and other applicable
	securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance
	practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial
	compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
	to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section&nbsp;404, we are required to furnish with our periodic Exchange Act reports a report by our management on
	our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to include with our annual report an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent
	registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404, we must document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In
	this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources and engage outside consultants to assess and document the adequacy of internal
	control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting
	and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. These efforts increased following management's conclusion that our accounting for net deferred tax assets in 2014 and early 2015
	revealed a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to technical accounting expertise over the accounting for deferred tax assets and income tax accounting in general.
	Despite the fact that we remediated this material weakness and despite our ongoing efforts to maintain our internal controls, there is a risk that our internal control over financial reporting may, in
	the future, be found to be ineffective under Section&nbsp;404. Our identification of one or more material weaknesses could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of
	confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapeutics to treat diseases of the back of the eye, with
	a focus on developing therapeutics for age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. Our most advanced product candidate is Fovista&reg; (pegpleranib), which is in Phase&nbsp;3 clinical
	development for use in combination with anti-VEGF drugs that represent the current standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. We have completed one Phase&nbsp;1 and one Phase&nbsp;2b clinical
	trial of Fovista administered in combination with the anti-VEGF drug Lucentis&reg; (ranibizumab), have completed patient enrollment for two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials of Fovista
	administered in combination with Lucentis and expect to complete enrollment in a third Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea&reg; (aflibercept) or
	Avastin&reg; (bevacizumab) in 2016. We have completed enrollment in two additional Phase&nbsp;2a clinical trials of Fovista administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs (Lucentis, Eylea
	or Avastin), one of which is studying the potential of Fovista to reduce subretinal fibrosis in wet AMD patients and the other of which is investigating the optimized regimen of Fovista in combination
	with anti-VEGF drugs, as well as the potential of Fovista to reduce the treatment burden for wet AMD patients. We are also developing our product candidate Zimura&reg; (avacincaptad pegol) as
	a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, a form of dry AMD, as well as in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD and for the treatment of
	polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. We are also investigating the
	potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option for a license.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pivotal Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista consists of three separate Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials to evaluate the

	for
	the treatment of wet AMD compared to anti-VEGF monotherapy. Two of these trials, referred to as the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials, are evaluating Fovista in combination with Lucentis
	compared to Lucentis monotherapy. The third trial, referred to as the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, is
	evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy. Our development strategy for Fovista is to be agnostic with respect to the choice of the anti-VEGF
	drug administered in combination with Fovista.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	completed patient enrollment in one of the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials in May 2015 and in the other Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trial in November 2015. The Fovista
	Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials are investigating Fovista in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy and are identical with respect to the trial design in the first year. Therefore,
	the databases from both of the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials will be locked and analyzed together, which will allow for the pooled analysis of certain relevant endpoints in accordance with
	the statistical analysis plan. We expect initial, top-line data from both of the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	are continuing to actively enroll patients in the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial and expect to complete enrollment in 2016, with initial, top-line data from this trial to
	be available in 2017 based on current enrollment estimates. This trial is investigating Fovista in combination with either Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy. Our
	Phase&nbsp;2b trial utilized Lucentis as the only anti-VEGF drug because Eylea was not yet approved and Avastin's non-inferiority status compared to Lucentis was not yet established at the time the
	Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial commenced. Therefore, in order to gain more experience with Fovista when administered in combination with Eylea or Avastin prior to starting a pivotal Phase&nbsp;3
	clinical trial, the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial started later (May 2014) than the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials (August 2013). This time period of approximately nine months
	allowed us to perform initial preclinical and clinical assessments and ensure compatibility of Eylea or Avastin when administered in combination with Fovista.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	key objective and plan is to make Fovista commercially available to physicians to treat their patients with wet AMD as quickly as possible, subject to a favorable data outcome from
	the Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program. We are continuing to explore various regulatory filing options. We plan to initially submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug
	Administration, or FDA, for Fovista in combination with Lucentis based upon data from the two Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials and subsequently submit an amendment to the NDA with data from the
	Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trial, subject to a favorable data outcome from these trials. Alternatively, we may choose to file&nbsp;a supplemental NDA for Fovista in combination with Eylea
	or Avastin following FDA review of the NDA for Fovista in combination with Lucentis.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis
	Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk active pharmaceutical
	ingredient, or API, supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment,
	prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we
	refer to as the Novartis Territory. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our ongoing pivotal Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis has agreed to use
	commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled
	syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance

	aggregate of $130.0&nbsp;million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista, $50.0&nbsp;million of which we achieved in
	September 2014 and received in October 2014 and $50.0&nbsp;million of which we achieved in March 2015 and received in April 2015, and up to an aggregate of an additional $300.0&nbsp;million upon
	achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory. In addition, Novartis has agreed to pay us up to

	Fovista products and combination Fovista products that Novartis successfully commercializes. We will receive royalties at a mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a
	royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to customary deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market
	exclusivity. Novartis's obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until Novartis's last actual commercial sale of such

	&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of
	2015, we initiated, a randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA. We plan to enroll approximately 300
	patients in the initial stage of the trial. During this stage, patients will be randomized into three groups, and will receive monthly injections of 1.0 mg of Zimura per eye, monthly injections of 2.0
	mg of Zimura per eye or monthly sham injections as the control arm. At month 18, we plan to conduct an interim analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of Zimura compared to sham. Upon review of
	this interim analysis, a determination will be made whether to continue the trial and whether to expand the trial by enrolling additional patients. Patients in the trial will receive monthly
	injections for 24&nbsp;months.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth

	&nbsp;&nbsp;In late 2014, we commenced a very

	PCV, a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. Our initial, preliminary analysis of the
	data from this trial has not revealed any safety concerns related to Zimura.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were incorporated and commenced active operations in 2007. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and
	staffing our company, acquiring rights to product candidates, business planning, raising capital and developing Fovista and Zimura. We acquired our rights to Fovista from (OSI) Eyetech,&nbsp;Inc.,
	or Eyetech, in July 2007. The acquisition included an assignment of license rights and obligations under an agreement with Archemix Corp. We have licensed rights to our product candidate Zimura from
	Archemix Corp. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $405.5&nbsp;million. Our net loss was
	$105.7&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, and $116.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating

	Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under

	received $125.0&nbsp;million of funding under the Novo Agreement, which constitutes the full amount of funding under that agreement. We also received an upfront payment of $200.0&nbsp;million from
	Novartis upon the execution of the Novartis Agreement and enrollment-based milestone payments of $50.0&nbsp;million in October 2014 and $50.0&nbsp;million in April 2015.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	expect our expenses to continue to increase, particularly as we continue the development of Fovista in our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program, as we further evaluate the potential
	benefit of Fovista when administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through the Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with
	unmet medical need, and as we pursue the development of Zimura through our Zimura development programs. We expect our expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment
	increases in trials that have already commenced. We also expect our expenses to increase as we manufacture validation batches of API and drug product for Fovista. In addition, our expenses will
	increase prior to obtaining marketing approval for Fovista as we expand our commercial infrastructure and build-up our Fovista API supply to support the anticipated launch of Fovista. Furthermore, if
	we obtain marketing approval for Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate that we may develop, we expect our commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and
	manufacturing to increase significantly. We are party to agreements, specifically a divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech),&nbsp;Inc., which agreement is now held by OSI
	Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;LLC, a subsidiary of Astellas US,&nbsp;LLC, and license agreements with Archemix Corp. and Nektar Therapeutics, that impose significant milestone payment obligations on us in
	connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Fovista and Zimura. We are also exploring the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for
	tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option to obtain a license, and expect our expenses to increase as we continue the preclinical development of this
	compound, including in the event we elect to exercise our option or in the event we trigger certain milestone payment obligations. Furthermore, we are incurring and expect to continue to incur costs
	associated with hiring additional personnel and expanding our facilities. See "&#151;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#151;Funding Requirements" for a discussion of factors affecting our
	future capital requirements.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue in excess of our expenses. We do not expect to generate significant product revenue unless, and
	until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, Fovista, Zimura or other product candidates that we may develop. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to develop and commercialize these
	product candidates. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. Our
	capital requirements will also depend on many other factors, including whether we pursue the acquisition or in-licensing and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies. We
	may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay,
	reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 2014, we had not generated any revenue. In May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0&nbsp;million in connection
	with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which has not been recorded as revenue due to certain contingencies associated with the payment. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a
	$50.0&nbsp;million enrollment-based milestone, or $100.0&nbsp;million in aggregate, under the Novartis Agreement. We recognized revenue of
	approximately $51.5&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the majority of which related to the $50.0&nbsp;million milestone payment we achieved in March 2015. The balance of
	the milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue. We use the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement.

	the future, we may generate additional revenue from a combination of product sales and license fees, milestone payments and research and development activity-related payments,
	payments for manufactured material and royalties in connection with the Novartis Agreement. We expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and
	amount of certain milestone and other payments, if any, that we may receive from Novartis and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our products, to the extent any are
	successfully commercialized. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until the end of 2017 at the earliest. If we fail to complete the development of Fovista, Zimura or other product
	candidates we may develop, in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially
	adversely affected.

	are successful, seeking marketing approval for Fovista. We also expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when
	administered in combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through our Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially, in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as
	a result of the pursuit of our Zimura development programs. We expect these research and development expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials
	that have already commenced. In addition, we expect that we will incur significant expenses related to manufacturing validation activities associated with Fovista and process development and
	manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura.

	clinical trial sites or changing the geographic mix of sites at which patients are enrolled. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with
	manufacturing validation, process development, the scale-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical

	change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate we may develop could mean a significant change in the
	costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently
	anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of Fovista or any other product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could
	be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.

	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements,
	which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
	reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments,
	including those related to accrued expenses and share-based compensation described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and
	various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
	readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

	Accrued Research and Development Expenses

</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves
	reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we
	have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met.
	We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of
	our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses are related to expenses incurred with respect to
	CROs, CMOs and other vendors in connection with research and development and manufacturing activities.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with such vendors that conduct research and
	development and manufacturing activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There
	may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the applicable research and development or manufacturing expense. In
	accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or
	the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred,
	our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or
	too low in any particular period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	the future, we may generate additional revenues from a combination of product sales and license fees, milestone payments, research and development activity-related payments, payments
	for manufactured material and royalties in connection with the Novartis Agreement. The terms of this agreement and other potential collaboration or commercialization agreements we may enter into
	generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (i)&nbsp;licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to our technology, (ii)&nbsp;research and development activities to be
	performed on behalf of the collaborative partner and (iii)&nbsp;in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical, clinical or commercial material. Payments to us under
	these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments;
	payments for manufactured material; and royalties on future product sales.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
	evaluating multiple element arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation requires subjective
	determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. In
	determining the units of accounting, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether the deliverables have standalone value, based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances
	for each arrangement. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are
	applied to each of the separate units.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price, if available, third-party evidence
	("TPE") of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable
	requires significant judgment. We use BESP to estimate the selling price for licenses to our proprietary technology, since we often do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price for these deliverables. In
	those circumstances where we utilize BESP to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors,
	including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed models that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs,
	probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our BESP, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine
	the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration among multiple deliverables.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
	management believes the license to our intellectual property and products has stand-alone value, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license upon delivery. When
	management believes such a license does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, we generally recognize revenue attributed to the license on a
	straight-line basis over our contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of our research and development obligations. If management cannot reasonably estimate when our
	performance obligation ends, then revenue is deferred until management can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ends. The periods over which revenue should be recognized are subject to
	estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
	the inception of arrangements that include milestone payments, we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of
	the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or
	(2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the consideration
	relates solely to past performance, and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the
	scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and
	whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	aggregate our milestones into three categories: (i)&nbsp;clinical and development milestones, (ii)&nbsp;regulatory milestones, and (iii)&nbsp;commercial milestones. Clinical and
	development milestones are typically achieved when a product candidate advances into a defined phase of clinical research or completes such phase or when a contractually specified clinical trial
	enrollment target is attained. Regulatory milestones are
	typically achieved upon acceptance of the submission of an application for marketing approval of a product candidate or upon approval to market the product candidate by the FDA or other regulatory
	authorities. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves
	global sales or annual sales of a specified amount.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues
	from clinical and development and regulatory milestone payments, if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable, are recognized upon
	successful accomplishment of the milestones. With regards to the Novartis Agreement, we have concluded that the clinical and development milestones and certain reimbursement approval milestones are
	not substantive and that the marketing approval milestones are substantive. Milestone payments received that are not considered substantive are included in the allocable arrangement consideration and
	are recognized as revenue in proportion to the relative-selling price allocation established at the inception of the arrangement. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as
	royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants by estimating the
	fair value of each equity award. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of forfeitures. We recognize
	compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us using the straight-line single
	option method. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we re-measure the fair value of consultant share-based awards as the awards vest, and recognize the resulting value, if any, as expense during
	the period the related services are rendered.

</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	. Determining the amount of
	share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expense ratably over the
	requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. For grants containing performance-based vesting provisions, expense is recognized over the estimated achievement
	period. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common
	stock, the expected term of our stock options, and the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the expected dividend yield of our common
	stock. As a recent public company, we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of the options. We calculate expected volatility based on
	reported data for similar publicly traded companies for which historical information is available and will continue to do so until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to
	measure expected volatility for future option grants.

	estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for
	instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The
	weighted-average assumptions used to estimate grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and

	to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 2.6&nbsp;years. We expect our share-based compensation for our equity awards to employees, non-employee directors and

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2014, we received $83.3&nbsp;million from Novo A/S under the Novo Agreement, which was reported as revenue for income tax
	purposes. Also in 2014, we received $200.0&nbsp;million from Novartis upon execution of the Novartis Agreement, a portion of which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. In addition, we
	received a milestone payment of $50.0&nbsp;million in 2014 from Novartis which was reported as revenue for income tax purposes. As a result of these payments, and after taking into account the
	utilization of our federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards and utilization of our research and development tax credits, we reported taxable income for tax purposes in 2014. We made income
	tax payments of $40.2&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. We incurred tax losses for 2015 and as such, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $16.8&nbsp;million for the
	year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets has been released, where appropriate. See Note&nbsp;9 to our financial statements in
	Part&nbsp;IV-Item&nbsp;15 of this Annual Report on form&nbsp;10-K for further information regarding our expectations with respect to our income tax provision.

	$42.6&nbsp;million compared to $88.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Research and development expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 included a
	$19.8&nbsp;million milestone payment we made in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which represented a significant portion of our research and development expenses for the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was primarily due to a $40.6&nbsp;million increase in costs associated
	with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs
	relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials and the Fovista Expansion Studies, the initiation of additional Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher
	manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials and for API validation activities. In addition, costs for our Zimura program increased by approximately $3.3&nbsp;million, with such increase
	primarily related to increased manufacturing and clinical trial costs. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $9.0&nbsp;million increase to share-based compensation costs

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 was approximately $41.3&nbsp;million. Using the relative selling

	Novartis Agreement and $0.9&nbsp;million related to the Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our research and development expenses were $88.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, an increase of
	$55.2&nbsp;million compared to $33.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $25.3&nbsp;million increase in costs associated with our
	Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to
	increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials and the initiation of certain Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical
	trials. The increase was also due to a higher milestone payment of $19.8&nbsp;million that we made in June 2014 in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, as compared to
	$3.5&nbsp;million in milestone payments we made in 2013 in connection with the initiation of our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials in August 2013. In addition, costs for our Zimura program increased by
	approximately $4.4&nbsp;million, with such increase primarily related to increased manufacturing costs. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $5.5&nbsp;million increase to share-based
	compensation costs and a $4.7&nbsp;million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 were $33.4&nbsp;million, an increase of
	$19.2&nbsp;million compared to $14.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a $4.6&nbsp;million increase to share-based compensation costs
	and a $7.0&nbsp;million increase to personnel costs. These increases were primarily due to an increase in personnel to support the expansion of our operations, including our public company
	infrastructure, as well as the hiring of additional management and corporate staffing, costs related to an executive retirement and other one-time post-employment costs. Also contributing to the
	increase were increased professional services and consulting fees, infrastructure costs, insurance costs and travel costs.

	$1.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. Net interest income earned during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 was a result of a significant increase in our investment
	portfolio average balances during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The amounts recorded in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 were
	related to interest expense associated with our venture debt facility that we entered into in June 2012. The debt facility was paid off in May 2013 and as such, there was no corresponding interest
	expense during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for income taxes recorded for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 was $36.5&nbsp;million. This primarily relates to
	the payments we received from Novartis and Novo A/S in 2014, a significant portion of which contributed to an increase in taxable income for 2014. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we did

	funding we received under the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February
	2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. In September 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 8,740,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering at a public offering
	price of $22.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of $175.6&nbsp;million. In February 2014, we issued and sold 1,900,000 shares of common stock and selling
	shareholders sold 728,571 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering at a public offering price of $31.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $55.4&nbsp;million from the follow-on
	offering. The Novo Agreement, which is described in more detail below, provided for financing of up to $125.0&nbsp;million in the aggregate in return for the sale to Novo A/S of royalty interests in

	Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista, of which, $50.0&nbsp;million was received in October 2014 and $50.0&nbsp;million was received in April 2015. In connection with the receipt of the

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our product candidates, Fovista and Zimura, are in clinical development. We expect our expenses to continue to increase, particularly
	as we continue the development of Fovista in our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program. We expect our expenses to increase as we further evaluate the potential benefit of Fovista when administered in
	combination with anti-VEGF drugs in wet AMD patients through the Fovista Expansion Studies, and potentially in other ophthalmic diseases and conditions with unmet medical need, and as we pursue the
	development of Zimura through our Zimura development programs. We expect our expenses to increase as we initiate additional trials and as patient enrollment increases in trials that have already
	commenced. We also expect our expenses to increase as we manufacture validation batches of API and drug product for Fovista. In addition, our expenses will increase prior to obtaining marketing
	approval for Fovista as we expand our commercial infrastructure and build-up our Fovista API supply to support the anticipated launch of Fovista. Furthermore, if we obtain marketing approval for
	Fovista, Zimura or any other product candidate that we may develop, we expect our commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing to increase
	significantly. For Fovista, our ex-U.S. commercialization partner, Novartis, is responsible for these commercialization expenses outside the United States. We are party to agreements, specifically a
	divestiture agreement with OSI (Eyetech),&nbsp;Inc., which is now held by OSI Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;LLC, a subsidiary of Astellas US,&nbsp;LLC, and license agreements with Archemix Corp., or
	Archemix, and Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, that impose significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones
	with respect to Fovista and Zimura. For example, in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, we made a milestone payment of $19.8&nbsp;million to Nektar Therapeutics in June 2014. We
	are also exploring the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which we have an option to obtain a license, and expect our expenses to
	increase as we continue the preclinical development of this compound, including in the event we elect to exercise our option or in the event we trigger certain milestone payment obligations.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $391.9&nbsp;million. We also had $368.9&nbsp;million in total liabilities,
	$338.1&nbsp;million of which related to the Novo Agreement and deferred revenue associated with the Novartis Agreement.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with the potential remaining enrollment-based $30.0&nbsp;million milestone payment under the Novartis
	Agreement, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements as currently planned through the end of 2017.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements will
	depend on several factors, including the success of our development and commercialization of our product candidates and whether we pursue the acquisition or in-licensing and subsequent development of
	additional product candidates or technologies. For example, our expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical
	trials. Our expenses may also exceed our expectations if we increase our investigator fees for our clinical trials, if we further expand the scope of our clinical trials and programs, including, for
	example, by increasing the number of clinical trial sites or changing the geographic mix of sites at which patients are enrolled. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for
	example, if we experience issues with manufacturing validation, process development, the scale-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we
	decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities or corporate staffing. If we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines
	Agency, or EMA, or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to perform clinical or nonclinical trials or other studies in addition to those we currently expect to conduct, or if there are any
	delays in completing the clinical trials of Fovista or Zimura, or the development of any of other product candidates that we may develop, our expenses could increase. As a result, we may need or may
	seek to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations prior than expected.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
	our current Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista is expected to continue into 2018, and we expect to incur substantial expenditures to complete the Phase&nbsp;3
	clinical program after the receipt of initial, top-line data, which we expect to be available during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the two Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Lucentis Trials and during 2017 for
	the Fovista Phase&nbsp;3 Eylea/Avastin Trials, based on current enrollment estimates. Furthermore, we expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At
	this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete the clinical development of either Fovista or Zimura, complete manufacturing validation activities associated with
	Fovista, process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities associated with Zimura and potentially seek marketing approval for Fovista and
	Zimura, or the nature, timing or costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of any other product candidate we may develop.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis
	Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk API supplied by us,
	standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human
	disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We have
	agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our ongoing pivotal Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a
	standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use
	commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans.
	Novartis has also granted us options, subject to specified limitations, and to the extent such rights are controlled by Novartis, to obtain exclusive rights from Novartis to develop and commercialize
	in the United States the co-formulated and pre-filled syringe products developed by Novartis. We and Novartis have each granted the other options, subject to specified limitations, to obtain access to
	study data from certain clinical trials of licensed products that we or Novartis may conduct, including for use by the other in regulatory filings in its territory. We have agreed to exclusively

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Novartis
	paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is also obligated to pay us up to an aggregate
	of $130.0&nbsp;million if we achieve specified patient enrollment-based milestones for our ongoing pivotal Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista, $50.0&nbsp;million of which we received in
	October 2014 and $50.0&nbsp;million of which we received in April 2015, and up to an aggregate of an additional $300.0&nbsp;million upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including
	marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory. In addition, Novartis has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of an additional $400.0&nbsp;million if
	Novartis achieves specified sales milestones in the Novartis Territory. Novartis is also obligated to pay us royalties with respect to standalone Fovista products and combination Fovista products that
	Novartis successfully commercializes. We will receive
	royalties at a mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to
	customary deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market exclusivity. Novartis's obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and
	country-by-country basis until Novartis's last actual commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We will continue to be responsible for royalties we owe to third parties on all sales of

	exercise our or its respective rights to obtain access to study data from clinical trials conducted by the other party, the party exercising the option will be obligated to pay the other party's
	associated past development costs and share equally with such other party any future associated development costs. If we exercise our option to obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop,
	manufacture and commercialize any co-formulated Fovista product in the United States, we will be obligated to pay a specified percentage of Novartis's associated past development costs and share with
	Novartis any future associated development costs. Novartis and we will also need to negotiate and agree on financial and other terms that would apply to such rights. If we exercise our option to
	obtain Novartis-controlled rights to develop and commercialize a pre-filled syringe product in the United States, we will be obligated to either enter into a supply agreement with Novartis under which
	we will pay Novartis its manufacturing cost plus a specified percentage margin for supplies of Fovista products in pre-filled syringes that Novartis supplies to us, or obtain supplies of products in
	pre-filled syringes from a third party manufacturer and pay Novartis a low single-digit percentage of our net sales of such products.

	other party experiences any specified insolvency event, if the other party challenges or assists a third party in challenging the validity or enforceability of certain patent rights controlled by the

	Novartis Agreement, or for specified safety reasons, effective at the end of a specified period following Novartis's written notice to us of Novartis's election to terminate the agreement. We may also
	terminate the agreement if Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an alternative anti-PDGF product in the Novartis Territory as more fully described below. If we elect to terminate the
	Novartis Agreement because specified governmental actions prevent the parties from materially progressing the development or commercialization of licensed products as described above, we will be
	required to pay a substantial termination fee. Following any termination, all rights to Fovista that we granted to Novartis, including, without limitation, the right to commercialize standalone
	Fovista products in the Novartis Territory, will revert to us, Novartis will perform specified activities in connection with transitioning to us the rights and responsibilities for the continued

	Alternative Anti-PDGF Product, in the Novartis Territory and, to the extent Novartis develops, in-licenses or acquires such a product, to make such product available to us in the United States under
	specified option conditions. If we exercise our option, we will be obligated to make certain payments to Novartis, including specified milestone and royalty payments. The amounts of such payments will
	vary based on the product's stage of clinical development at the time we exercise our option, whether the product is a standalone or combination product and whether Novartis exercises an option to
	co-promote such product in the United States. If Novartis determines to seek marketing approval of an Alternative Anti-PDGF Product in the Novartis Territory, we will, subject to specified
	limitations, have the option to terminate the Novartis Agreement, convert Novartis's exclusive licenses into non-exclusive licenses, or elect to receive a royalty on sales of such product by Novartis.
	If we elect to terminate the Novartis Agreement, Novartis will, subject to specified limitations, be required to pay to us, certain payments based on achievement, with respect to such product, of the

	Commercial API Supply Agreement
</I>
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2015, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Agilent, pursuant to which Agilent has agreed
	to manufacture and supply to us, and we have agreed to purchase from Agilent, a specified percentage of our commercial requirements in all jurisdictions of Fovista API. The commercial supply agreement
	has an initial term that runs for seven years from the date of our first commercial sale of Fovista, and which is subject to one two-year automatic renewal period, absent termination by either party
	in accordance with the terms of the commercial supply agreement. The commercial supply agreement provides for pricing for Fovista API structured on a tiered basis, with the price reduced as the volume
	of Fovista API ordered increases. We may cancel any purchase order under the commercial supply agreement at any time, subject to the payment of specified cancellation fees. We may terminate the
	commercial supply agreement with no financial penalty in the event that we cannot commercialize Fovista due to regulatory or other medical, scientific or legal reasons. Agilent may terminate the
	commercial supply agreement in the event that we do not, over a specified period, purchase and take delivery from Agilent of a specified minimum quantity of Fovista API. Each party also has the right
	to terminate the commercial supply agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The commercial supply agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Agilent
	with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Agilent in connection with marketing applications for Fovista, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary
	matters for an agreement of this kind.

	Financing Agreement with Novo A/S
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2013, we entered into the Novo Agreement, pursuant to which we had the ability to obtain financing in three tranches in an
	amount of up to $125.0&nbsp;million in return for the sale to Novo A/S of aggregate royalties of a mid-single-digit percentage on worldwide sales of Fovista, with the royalty percentage determined
	by the amount of funding provided by Novo A/S. The three tranches of financing, in which Novo A/S purchased three low single-digit royalty interests and paid us $125.0&nbsp;million in the aggregate,
	closed in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	royalty payment period begins on the commercial launch of Fovista and ends, on a country-by-country basis, on the latest to occur of the twelfth anniversary of the commercial launch
	of Fovista, the expiration of certain patent rights covering Fovista, and the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Fovista, in each applicable country. Royalty payments will be payable quarterly
	in arrears during the royalty period. Our obligations under the Novo Agreement may also apply to certain other anti-platelet derived growth factor, or anti-PDGF, products we may develop.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	used a portion of the proceeds that we initially received under the Novo Agreement to repay in full an aggregate of $14.4&nbsp;million of outstanding principal, interest and fees
	under our venture debt facility and are using the remaining proceeds primarily to support clinical development and regulatory activities for Fovista and for general corporate expenses.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Novo Agreement requires the establishment by Novo A/S and us of a joint oversight committee in relation to the development of Fovista in the event that Novo A/S does not continue to
	have a representative on our board of directors. The Novo Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, as well as certain covenants relating to the operation of our business,
	including covenants requiring us to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue our development of Fovista, to file, prosecute and maintain certain patent rights and, in our reasonable judgment,
	to pursue claims of infringement of our intellectual property rights. The Novo Agreement also places certain restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to grant security
	interests in our intellectual property to third parties, to sell, transfer or out-license intellectual property, or to grant others rights to receive royalties on sales of Fovista and certain other
	products. We reimbursed Novo A/S for specified legal and other expenses and are required to provide Novo A/S with certain continuing information rights. We have agreed to indemnify Novo A/S and its
	representatives with respect to certain matters, including with respect to any third-party infringement or product liability claims relating to our products. Our obligations under the Novo agreement
	are secured by a lien on certain of our intellectual property and other rights related to Fovista and other anti-PDGF products we may develop.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of
	$391.9&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, consisting of cash, investments in money market funds certain investment-grade corporate debt securities, and direct investment in U.S. Treasury
	securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because a significant portion of
	our investments are in short-term securities. Our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. Due to the low risk profile of our
	investments, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.

	controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
	recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
	limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
	communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
	recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its
	judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

	Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in
	Rules&nbsp;13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
	supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding
	the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
	of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
	periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
	management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set

	obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
	over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
	performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Item&nbsp;9A in our Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K/A for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, filed with the
	Securities and Exchange Commission on July&nbsp;28, 2015, in July 2015, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2014,
	which material weakness was unchanged as of March&nbsp;31, 2015, and remained unchanged as of June&nbsp;30, 2015. During the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015, we took the following
	steps to remediate the identified material weakness: we added staffing within our finance department and engaged a nationally recognized accounting firm, in each case, with technical expertise in the
	area of tax accounting and financial reporting. Our management has concluded that the identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting was fully remediated as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. Other than the remediation steps described above, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the
	Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
	the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ophthotech Corporation at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and
	2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Ophthotech Corporation's internal control over financial
	reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
	Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February&nbsp;26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophthotech Corporation (the "Company" or "Ophthotech") was incorporated on January&nbsp;5, 2007, in Delaware. The Company is a
	biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapeutics to treat diseases of the back of the eye, with a focus on developing therapeutics for age-related macular degeneration,
	or AMD. The Company's most advanced product candidate is Fovista&reg; (pegpleranib), which is an anti-platelet derived growth factor ("PDGF") aptamer that is in Phase&nbsp;3 clinical
	development for use in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ("VEGF") drugs that represent the current standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. The Company has completed one
	Phase&nbsp;1 and one Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of Fovista administered in combination with the anti-VEGF drug Lucentis&reg; (ranibizumab), has completed patient enrollment for two
	Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials of Fovista administered in combination with Lucentis and expects to complete enrollment in a third Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial evaluating Fovista in combination with
	Eylea&reg; (aflibercept) or Avastin&reg; (bevacizumab) in 2016. The Company is also developing its product candidate Zimura&reg; (avacincaptad pegol), an inhibitor of
	complement factor C5, for the treatment of patients with geographic atrophy ("GA"), a form of dry AMD, in combination with anti-VEGF drugs for the treatment of wet AMD, as well as for the treatment of
	polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy ("PCV"), a specific type of wet AMD, in patients who do not respond adequately to treatment with anti-VEGF monotherapy or for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy fails. The
	Company is also investigating the potential of an ophthalmic formulation for tivozanib, a small molecule VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which the Company has an option for a license.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
	judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions
	that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Company's Balance Sheets and the amount of expenses reported for each of the periods
	presented are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but not limited to, accounting for research and development costs, revenue recognition, accounting for share-based compensation
	and accounting for income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	for sale securities with original maturities of greater than one year are recorded as non-current assets. Available for sale securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are
	recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The estimated fair value of the available for sale securities is determined based on quoted market prices or rates for similar
	instruments. In addition, the cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity. The Company evaluates securities with unrealized
	losses to determine whether such losses, if any, are other than temporary.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 2014, the Company had not generated any revenue. In May 2014, the Company received an upfront payment of $200.0&nbsp;million
	in connection with its licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, (the "Novartis Agreement"), which has not been recorded as revenue due to certain contingencies associated
	with the payment. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, the Company achieved a $50.0&nbsp;million enrollment-based milestone, or $100.0&nbsp;million in the aggregate, under the Novartis
	Agreement. The Company recognized revenue of approximately $51.5&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the majority of which related to the $50.0&nbsp;million milestone
	payment it achieved in March 2015. The balance of the milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue. The Company uses the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to
	the Company's performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Below is a summary of the components of the Company's collaboration revenue for the years ended December 2015, 2014 and 2013:

	agreement
	and other potential collaboration or commercialization agreements the Company may enter into generally contain multiple elements, or deliverables, which may include (i)&nbsp;licenses, or
	options to obtain licenses, to certain of the Company's technology and products, (ii)&nbsp;research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner, and
	(iii)&nbsp;in certain cases, services in connection with the manufacturing of preclinical, clinical and commercial material. Payments to the Company under these arrangements typically include one or
	more of the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; option exercise fees; funding of research and/or development efforts; milestone payments; payments for manufactured material; and royalties
	on future product sales.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
	evaluating multiple element arrangements, the Company considers whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting. This evaluation requires
	subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual deliverables and whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual
	relationship. In
	determining the units of accounting, management evaluates certain criteria, including whether the deliverables have standalone value, based on the relevant facts and circumstances for each
	arrangement. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each
	of the separate units.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company determines the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price, if available, third-party
	evidence ("TPE") of selling price if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a
	deliverable requires significant judgment. The Company uses BESP to estimate the selling price for licenses to the Company's proprietary technology, since the Company often does not have VSOE or TPE
	of selling price for these deliverables. In those circumstances where the Company utilizes BESP to determine the estimated selling price of a license to the Company's proprietary technology, the
	Company considers market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed models that include
	assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate that is subject to the license. In
	validating the Company's BESP, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the BESP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration
	among multiple deliverables.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
	management believes the license to its intellectual property and products has stand-alone value, the Company generally recognizes revenue attributed to the license upon delivery.
	When management believes such a license does not have stand-alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement, the Company generally recognizes revenue attributed to the
	license on a straight-line basis over the Company's contractual or estimated performance period, which is typically the term of the Company's research and development obligations. If management cannot
	reasonably estimate when the Company's performance obligation ends, then revenue is deferred until management can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ends. The periods over which
	revenue should be recognized are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development agreement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount
	of revenue the Company records in future periods.

<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
	the inception of arrangements that include milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent
	nature of the milestone. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, or
	(2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity's performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the consideration
	relates solely to past performance, and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. The Company evaluates factors such as
	the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be
	overcome to achieve the respective milestone, the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all
	deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company aggregates its milestones into three categories: (i)&nbsp;clinical and development milestones, (ii)&nbsp;regulatory milestones, and (iii)&nbsp;commercial milestones.
	Clinical and development milestones are typically achieved when a product candidate advances into a defined phase of clinical research or completes such phase or when a contractually specified
	clinical trial enrollment target is attained. Regulatory milestones are typically achieved upon acceptance of the submission of an application for marketing approval for a product candidate or upon
	approval to market the product candidate by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") or other regulatory authorities. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved
	pharmaceutical product reaches certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues
	from clinical and development and regulatory milestone payments, if the milestones are deemed substantive and the milestone payments are nonrefundable, are recognized upon
	successful accomplishment of the milestones. With regard to the Novartis Agreement, the Company has concluded that the clinical and development milestones and certain reimbursement milestones are not
	substantive and that the marketing approval milestones are substantive. Milestone payments received that are not considered substantive are included in the allocable arrangement consideration and are
	recognized as revenue in proportion to the relative-selling price allocation established at the inception of the arrangement. Revenues from commercial milestone payments are accounted for as royalties
	and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
	temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company incurred U.S. federal net operating losses ("NOLs") in each year from its inception in 2007
	through 2013 and utilized these NOLs in 2014. As such, all prior tax years since 2007 remain subject to potential tax examination as the utilization of NOLs from prior years opens the relevant year to
	potential audit.

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees and non-employee directors on the date of grant using the
	Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Due to the lack of trading history, the Company's computation of stock-price volatility is based on the volatility rates of comparable publicly held companies over
	a period equal to the expected term of the options granted by the Company. The Company's computation of expected term is determined using the "simplified" method, which is the midpoint between the
	vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The Company believes that it does not have sufficient reliable exercise data in order to justify the use of a method other than the "simplified"
	method of estimating the expected exercise term of employee stock option grants. The Company utilizes a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends to
	stockholders and has no current intentions to pay
	cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield at the date of grant for a term equivalent to the expected term of the option.

<I>
	Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	.
	Consultant stock option grants are recorded as an expense over the vesting period of the underlying stock
	options. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to vesting, the value of these options, as calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, will be re-measured using the fair
	value of the Company's common stock and the non-cash expense recognized during the period will be adjusted accordingly. Since the fair value of options granted to consultants is subject to change in
	the future, the amount of the future expense will include fair value re-measurements until the stock options are fully vested.

</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No.&nbsp;2014-09,
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<I>
	Revenue from Contracts with
	Customers (Topic 606)
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in
	accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides
	a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
	that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after
	December&nbsp;15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<I>
	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
	Deferral of the Effective Date,
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	which provides a one-year deferral of the effective date for the new revenue standard. Public companies should now apply the guidance in ASU
	2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods
	beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that annual period. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU 2014-09.
	The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its financial statements and footnote disclosures.

	Presentation of Financial Statements&#151;Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about
	an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	, which defines management's responsibility to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide
	related footnote disclosures if there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods ending after
	December&nbsp;15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<I>
	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
	Taxes
</I>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	, which updated and simplified the presentation of deferred income taxes. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into
	current and non-current amounts in a classified statement of financial position. The requirement results in little or no benefit to users of financial statements because the classification does not
	generally align with the time period in which the recognized deferred tax amounts are expected to be recovered or settled. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this
	update require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax assets and liabilities of
	a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements
	issued for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual
	reporting period. The Company has elected to adopt this standard retrospectively, effective December&nbsp;31, 2015. As a result of this adoption, the Company reclassified its deferred income tax
	asset, current as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, to deferred income taxes to conform with current year presentation.

	Agreement,
	the Company granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by the Company to manufacture, from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient, or
	API, supplied by the Company, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention,
	cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States (the "Novartis
	Territory"). The Company has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete its ongoing pivotal Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis has agreed to use commercially
	reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF drug to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe
	presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with
	agreed development and marketing plans. Novartis has also granted the Company options, subject to specified limitations, and to
	the extent such rights are controlled by Novartis, to obtain exclusive rights from Novartis to develop and commercialize in the United States the co-formulated and pre-filled syringe products
	developed by Novartis. The Company and Novartis have each granted the other options, subject to specified limitations, to obtain access to study data from certain clinical trials of licensed products
	that the Company or Novartis may conduct, including for use by the other in regulatory filings in its territory. The Company has agreed to exclusively supply Novartis, and Novartis has agreed to
	exclusively purchase from the Company, its clinical and commercial requirements for the bulk API for Fovista for use in licensed products in the Novartis Territory. The Company has agreed not to
	commercialize any product comprising Fovista or any other anti-PDGF product in the ophthalmic field in the Novartis Territory.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Novartis
	paid the Company a $200.0&nbsp;million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, Novartis is also obligated to pay the
	Company up to an aggregate of $130.0&nbsp;million if the Company achieves specified patient enrollment-based milestones for its Phase&nbsp;3 clinical program for Fovista, of which
	$50.0&nbsp;million was achieved in September 2014 and received by the Company in October 2014 and $50.0&nbsp;million was achieved in March 2015 and received in April 2015, and up to an aggregate
	of an additional $300.0&nbsp;million upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including marketing approval and reimbursement approval in certain countries in the Novartis Territory. In
	addition, Novartis has agreed to pay the Company up to an aggregate of an additional $400.0&nbsp;million if Novartis achieves specified sales milestones in the Novartis Territory. Novartis is also
	obligated to pay the Company royalties with respect to standalone Fovista products and combination Fovista products that Novartis successfully commercializes. The Company will receive royalties at a
	mid-thirties percentage of net sales of standalone Fovista products and a royalty of approximately equal value for sales of combination Fovista products. Such royalties are subject to customary
	deductions, credits, and reductions for lack of patent coverage or market exclusivity. Novartis's obligation to pay such royalties will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and
	country-by-country basis until Novartis's last actual commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. The Company will continue to be responsible for royalties it owes to third parties on
	sales of Fovista products.

	exercising the option, the cost to exercise the option and the likelihood that the option will be exercised. For arrangements under which an option is considered substantive, assuming the option is

	7. Financing Agreement with Novo A/S
</B>
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2013, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Novo A/S, which is referred to as the Novo Agreement, pursuant to which the Company had the ability to obtain
	financing in three tranches in an amount of up to $125.0&nbsp;million in return for the sale to Novo A/S of aggregate royalties of worldwide sales of (a)&nbsp;Fovista, (b)&nbsp;Fovista-Related
	Products, and (c)&nbsp;Other Products (each as defined in the Novo Agreement), calculated as low to mid-single digit percentages of net sales, with the royalty percentage determined by the amount of
	funding provided by Novo A/S.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Novo Agreement provided for up to three separate purchases for a purchase price of $41.7&nbsp;million each, at a first, second and third closing, for an aggregate purchase price of
	$125.0&nbsp;million. In each purchase, Novo A/S would acquire rights to a low single digit percentage of net sales. In each of May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014, the Company received cash
	payments of $41.7&nbsp;million, or $125.0&nbsp;million in the aggregate, and Novo A/S received, in the aggregate, a right to receive royalties on net sales of Fovista at a mid-single digit
	percentage.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	royalty payment period covered by the Novo Agreement begins on commercial launch and ends, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on the latest to occur of
	(i)&nbsp;the 12th&nbsp;anniversary of the commercial launch, (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of certain patent rights and (iii)&nbsp;the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity for each product in
	each country.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
	the terms of the Novo Agreement, the Company is not required to reimburse or otherwise compensate Novo A/S through any means other than the agreed royalty entitlement. In addition,
	the Company does not, under the terms of the Novo Agreement, have the right or obligation to prepay Novo A/S in connection with a change of control of the Company or otherwise.

	7. Financing Agreement with Novo A/S (Continued)

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $125.0&nbsp;million in aggregate proceeds from the three financing tranches under the Novo Agreement represents the full funding available under the Novo Agreement, and has been
	recorded as a liability on the Company's Balance Sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, in accordance with ASC 730,
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>
	. Because
	there is a significant related party relationship between the Company and Novo A/S, the Company is treating its obligation to make royalty payments under the Novo Agreement as an implicit obligation
	to repay the funds advanced by Novo A/S. As the Company makes royalty payments in accordance with the Novo Agreement, it will reduce the liability balance. At the time that such royalty payments
	become probable and estimable, and if such amounts exceed the liability balance, the Company will impute interest accordingly on a prospective basis based on such estimates, which would result in a
	corresponding increase in the liability balance.
</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Novo Agreement requires the establishment of a Joint Oversight Committee in the event that Novo A/S does not continue to have a representative on the Company's board of directors.
	The Joint Oversight Committee would have responsibilities that include "discussion and review" of all matters related to Fovista research, development, regulatory approval and commercialization, but
	there is no provision either implicit or explicit that gives the Joint Oversight Committee or its members decision-making authority.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
	assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts
	become
	deductible, and is impacted by the Company's ability to carryback losses to 2014, the only year in which the Company had taxable income. The Company incurred tax losses in 2015. As such, the Company
	has recorded a benefit from income taxes during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The Company currently expects to realize its net deferred tax assets recorded as of December&nbsp;31, 2015
	due to the Company's ability to carryback its expected 2015 federal tax losses to 2014. The Company expects to carry forward its 2015 state tax losses due to various state restrictions on the use of
	carryback claims. The state NOLs are expected to begin to expire in 2027. Because of the Company's history of losses and lack of other positive evidence to support taxable income after the 2014 tax
	year, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against those remaining deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred
	tax assets relating to employee share-based compensation deductions were reduced to reflect exercises of non-qualified stock option grants and vesting of RSUs. Although certain
	of these deductions will be reported on the corporate tax returns and increase the Company's NOLs, these related tax benefits are not recognized for financial reporting purposes.

	August 2013, the Company's board of directors adopted and the Company's stockholders approved the 2013 stock incentive plan (the "2013 Plan"), which became effective immediately prior

	awards, restricted stock unit awards, and other stock-based awards. Upon effectiveness of the 2013 Plan, the number of shares of the Company's common stock that were reserved for issuance under the
	2013 Plan was the sum of (1)&nbsp;such number of shares (up to approximately 3,359,641 shares) as is equal to the sum of 739,317 shares (the number of shares of the common stock then available for
	issuance under the 2007 Plan), and such number of shares of the Company's common stock that are subject to outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan that expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered,
	canceled, forfeited or repurchased by the Company at their original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right plus (2)&nbsp;an annual increase, to be added the first business day of
	each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2014 and continuing until, and including, the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2023, equal to the lowest of 2,542,372
	shares of the Company's common stock, 4% of the number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding on the first day of the fiscal year and an amount determined by its board of directors. The
	Company's employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors are eligible to receive awards under the 2013 Plan. However, incentive stock options may only be granted to employees of the Company.

	, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to
	transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value standard also establishes a three-level
	hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	Company reviews investments on a periodic basis for other than temporary impairments. This review is subjective as it requires management to evaluate whether an event or change in
	circumstances has occurred in the period that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The Company uses the market approach to measure fair value for its financial
	assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. The Company classifies its corporate debt securities
	within the fair value hierarchy as Level&nbsp;2 assets, as it primarily utilizes quoted market prices or rates for similar instruments to value these securities.
</FONT>

<P STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:TIMES;">
<FONT SIZE=2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

	Level&nbsp;1&#151;inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in

The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this letter comply with, or be exempt from,&nbsp;Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively &#147;Code Section&nbsp;409A&#148;). Accordingly, if any provision of this letter is ambiguous, such that one interpretation would subject a payment or benefit to the excise tax imposed by Code Section&nbsp;409A and an alternative interpretation would not so subject the payment or benefit, the parties intend the interpretation that would not so subject the payment or benefit to apply. With regard to any provision herein that provides for reimbursement of costs and expenses or in-kind benefits, except as permitted by Code Section&nbsp;409A, (i)&nbsp;the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, (ii)&nbsp;the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits, provided during any taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year, provided that this clause (ii)&nbsp;shall not be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Section&nbsp;105(a)&nbsp;of the Code solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect, and (in) such payments shall be made on or before the last day of your taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense occurred, provided that any tax gross-ups may be reimbursed by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such taxes are remitted to the taxing authorities. For purposes of Code Section&nbsp;409A, each payment hereunder shall be treated as a separate payment and your right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. In no event may you, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this letter that is considered nonqualified deferred compensation. Termination of employment as used herein shall mean separation from service within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;409A. In the event at the time of any separation from service you are a &#147;specified employee&#148; within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;409A, any deferred compensation subject to Code Section&nbsp;409A payable as a result of such termination shall not be paid prior to the earlier of six (6)&nbsp;months after such termination and your death and shall be paid immediately thereafter.

The Participant must satisfy all applicable federal, state, and local or other income and employment tax withholding obligations before the Company will deliver stock certificates or otherwise recognize ownership of Common Stock under this option. The Company may decide to satisfy the withholding obligations through additional withholding on salary or wages. If the Company elects not to or cannot withhold from other compensation, the Participant must pay the Company the full amount, if any, required for withholding or have a broker tender to the Company cash equal to the withholding obligations. Payment of withholding obligations is due before the Company will issue any shares on exercise of this option or at the same time as payment of the exercise price, unless the Company determines otherwise. If approved by the Board, in its sole discretion, a Participant may satisfy such tax obligations in whole or in part by delivery (either by actual delivery or attestation) of shares of Common Stock underlying this option valued at their Fair Market Value;
<I>
	provided, however

	, except as otherwise provided by the Board, that the total tax withholding where stock is being used to satisfy such tax obligations cannot exceed the Company&#146;s minimum statutory withholding obligations (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income). Shares used to satisfy tax withholding requirements cannot be subject to any forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements.
