	The Company

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical-stage
	biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel, first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. We have exclusive worldwide rights to a portfolio of five drug candidates in clinical trials or
	preclinical studies, which are based on small molecules licensed from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand. Our lead clinical program is VK5211, a first-in-class, orally available drug candidate currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for
	acute rehabilitation following non-elective hip fracture surgery. Hip fracture is a common injury among persons aged 60 and older. VK5211 is a non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator, or SARM. A SARM is designed to selectively interact
	with a subset of receptors that have a normal physiologic role of interacting with naturally-occurring hormones called androgens. Broad activation of androgen receptors with drugs, such as exogenous testosterone, can stimulate muscle growth and
	improve bone mineral density, or BMD, but often results in unwanted side effects such as prostate growth, hair growth and acne. VK5211 has been shown to selectively produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone in muscle and bone tissue,
	potentially accelerating rehabilitation and improving outcomes among hip fracture patients. We commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial of VK5211 in October&nbsp;2015 and expect to complete enrollment in the trial in the second half of 2016 and complete
	the trial in the first quarter of 2017. We are also focused on the development of first-in-class, selective, small molecule agonists of the thyroid hormone receptor beta, or TR&szlig;, for lipid disorders. Our lead TR&szlig; program is VK2809, a
	liver-selective, orally available prodrug of a potent small molecule TR&szlig; agonist. TR&szlig; is known to regulate expression of genes important for lipid metabolism, which we believe suggests potential therapeutic benefits for patients
	suffering from hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia and diseases resulting from accumulation of fat in liver tissue, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of VK2809 in patients with
	hypercholesterolemia and elevated liver fat content in the first half of 2016. Our second TR&szlig; agonist is VK0214, which we are evaluating in the orphan disease known as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, or X-ALD. Preclinical studies of VK0214 in
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	models of X-ALD showed positive effects on genes relevant to X-ALD. We are evaluating VK0214 in an
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	model of
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	X-ALD
</FONT>
	and expect to report preliminary data in 2016. Pending
	completion of this work, we expect to initiate clinical trials of VK0214 in X-ALD patients.

	VK5211 for Hip Fracture

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	VK5211 is an orally available small molecule drug candidate in development for maintenance or improvement of lean body mass, or LBM, BMD and function in
	patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery. VK5211 is a potent, tissue-selective, non-steroidal SARM. VK5211 belongs to a family of novel SARM compounds based on its effects on tissue-specific gene expression and other functional,
	cell-based technologies. We expect VK5211 to produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone with improved safety, tolerability and patient acceptance due to a tissue-selective mechanism of action and an oral route of administration. Tissue
	selectivity is particularly important in treating patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery, as these patients experience abnormally elevated losses of muscle tissue and BMD. This results in a loss of muscle

	strength, an increased risk of additional fractures and increased mortality. We believe the selective stimulation of androgen receptors in muscle and bone provides an attractive therapeutic
	approach for patients recovering from hip fractures. In Phase 1 clinical trials, subjects treated with VK5211 experienced increases in LBM following 21&nbsp;days of treatment. We observed positive dose-dependent trends in functional exercise and
	strength measures consistent with anabolic activity. In addition, no drug-related serious adverse events were reported. In an established animal model of osteoporosis, treatment with VK5211 resulted in significant increases in BMD and bone strength.
	In October&nbsp;2015, we commenced enrollment for a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery, and we expect to enroll a total of&nbsp;120 patients and&nbsp;complete enrollment in this
	clinical trial in the second half of 2016. Pending positive data from this clinical trial, we plan to advance VK5211 in further clinical trials. We also plan to discuss with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, potential clinical
	development of VK5211 in other settings, such as cancer cachexia.

	Hip fractures occur in over 300,000 persons in the U.S. annually. Most hip
	fractures occur in the elderly, often resulting from minimal trauma, such as a fall from standing height. Unfortunately, elderly individuals are at higher risk of substantial morbidity and mortality due to these fractures as a result of higher rates
	of frailty and undernourishment. Furthermore, the rate of hip fracture is known to increase with age, doubling every five to six years after age 60. Fractures of the hip can lead to devastating consequences. Disability frequently results from
	persistent pain and limited physical mobility. Hip fractures are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, with approximately 15%-20% of patients dying within one year of fracture. There are currently no approved therapies in the U.S. for
	restoration or preservation of LBM, BMD or physical function in patients who have suffered a hip fracture. Pharmacological interventions, including with steroids, have demonstrated limited clinical benefit or expose patients to the risk of
	undesirable side-effects, such as virilization in women and prostate growth in men. We believe the potential size of the worldwide hip fracture treatment market for a SARM exceeds $1.0&nbsp;billion annually.

	Our second program is focused on the development of orally available small molecule thyroid hormone receptor beta, or TR&szlig;, agonists. Our two lead
	molecules are VK2809 and VK0214. We believe selective TR&szlig; agonists have the potential to treat a variety of lipid disorders. Thyroid hormone receptors are found in several tissues throughout the body. The TR&szlig; isoform is the major

	isoform is the major subtype expressed in the heart. Selective activation of the TR&szlig; receptor in liver tissue is believed to favorably affect
	cholesterol and lipoprotein levels via multiple mechanisms, including increasing the expression of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, receptors and increasing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. These characteristics in turn lead to reductions of
	low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, plasma and liver triglycerides. We are developing VK2809 for the potential treatment of hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease. We are developing VK0214 for the potential treatment of X-ALD.

	We believe our selective
	TR&szlig; agonists are capable of achieving this unique lipid lowering profile without eliciting unwanted effects on the heart and thyroid hormone axis. In a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial, patients with mild hypercholesterolemia who
	were treated with VK2809 at doses of 5 mg and above experienced significant placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions from baseline, ranging from approximately 15% -41%. In addition, placebo-adjusted triglyceride levels were reduced by more than 30% at
	doses of 2.5 mg and above. There were no serious adverse events observed in this trial, and no differences in heart rate, heart rhythm or blood pressure were observed between VK2809 and placebo-treated patients. In addition, VK2809 has demonstrated
	significant reductions in liver fat content in multiple animal models of fatty liver disease, suggesting potential efficacy in the setting of NASH. We plan to commence a Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial of VK2809 in approximately 100&nbsp;patients with
	hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease in the first half of 2016 and to complete this clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.

	As a result, we believe the global market opportunity for VK2809 in hypercholesterolemia or NASH exceeds $1.0 billion.

	We are also developing TR&szlig; agonists for the
	treatment and potential prophylaxis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, or X-ALD, a rare X-linked, inherited neurological disorder characterized by a breakdown in the protective barriers surrounding brain and nerve cells. The disease is caused by
	mutations in a transporter of very long chain fatty acids, or VLCFA, known as the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter D1, or ABCD1. As a result of the mutations, transporter function is impaired and patients are unable to efficiently
	metabolize VLCFA. TR&szlig; is known to regulate expression of an alternative VLCFA transporter, known as ABCD2. Various preclinical models have demonstrated that increased expression of ABCD2 can lead to normalization of VLCFA metabolism.
	Preliminary data suggest that our molecules stimulate ABCD2 expression levels. We are conducting
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	studies of VK0214 and expect to report preliminary data in 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	X-ALD is a rare, often fatal condition believed to occur with an incidence of approximately one in 17,000 births. X-ALD is caused by mutations in the gene
	encoding for ABCD1, which is located on the X chromosome. Men have one X chromosome, while women have two copies. Because of this, an inherited mutation in the ABCD1 gene is more likely to manifest in males relative to females. The ABCD1 protein
	plays a critical role in the transport of VLCFA into a cellular organelle called the peroxisome, where VLCFA metabolism and disposal occur. Without functional ABCD1, VLCFA accumulate in cells, including neural cells, where they can lead to membrane
	disruption and damage to the myelin sheath, a protective and insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. This damage can result in decreased motor coordination and function, visual and hearing disturbances, the loss of cognitive
	function, dementia, seizures, adrenal dysfunction and other complications, including death. There are currently no approved therapies for X-ALD and pharmacologic interventions have demonstrated limited clinical benefit. As a result, we believe the
	worldwide X-ALD market exceeds $1.0&nbsp;billion.

	type 2 diabetes therapies. Our preclinical programs are focused on identifying orally available erythropoietin receptor, or EPOR, agonists, for the potential treatment of anemia, and on the development of tissue-selective inhibitors of
	diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1, or DGAT-1, for the potential treatment of obesity and dyslipidemia.

<B>
	We are a
	clinical-stage company, have a very limited operating history and are expected to incur significant operating losses during the early stage of our corporate development.
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical-stage company. We were incorporated in, and have only been conducting operations since, September&nbsp;2012. Our operations to date have been
	limited to raising capital, building infrastructure, obtaining the worldwide rights to certain technology from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand, and planning, preparing and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of our drug
	candidates, including VK5211 and VK0612, which are currently in Phase 2 clinical development, VK2809, which has completed Phase 1 clinical development and VK0214 and the EPOR and DGAT-1 programs, which are each currently in preclinical development.
	As a result, we have no meaningful historical operations upon which to evaluate our business and prospects and have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain marketing approval for any of our drug candidates or successfully overcome the risks and
	uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. We also have not generated any revenue to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses. Our net loss for the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015 was $21,884,183 and $23,403,988, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $45,545,445. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to incur losses, which will increase
	significantly from historical levels as we expand our drug development activities, seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates and begin to commercialize them if they are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, the
	European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or comparable foreign authorities. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more drug candidates, we may never become profitable. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability, it would
	adversely affect the value of our common stock.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:18PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<B>
	We are substantially dependent on technologies we licensed from Ligand, and if we lose the license to
	such technologies or the Master License Agreement is terminated for any reason, our ability to develop existing and new drug candidates would be harmed, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and
	adversely affected.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our business is substantially dependent upon technology licensed from Ligand. Pursuant to the Master License Agreement, we have
	been granted exclusive worldwide rights to VK5211, VK2809, VK0214, VK0612 and preclinical programs for anemia and lipid disorders. SARMS, such as our lead program VK5211, are key compounds used by us in the development and commercialization of our
	drug candidates. All of the intellectual property related to our drug candidates is currently owned by Ligand, and we have the rights to use such intellectual property pursuant to the Master License Agreement. Therefore, our ability to develop and
	commercialize our drug candidates depends entirely on the effectiveness and continuation of the Master License Agreement. If we lose the right to license any of these key compounds, our ability to develop existing and new drug candidates would be
	harmed.

	Ligand has the right to terminate the Master License Agreement under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (1)&nbsp;in the event
	of our insolvency or bankruptcy, (2)&nbsp;if we do not pay an undisputed amount owing under the Master License Agreement when due and fail to cure such default within a specified period of time, or (3)&nbsp;if we default on certain of our material

	We have spent significant time, money and effort on the licensing and development
	of our core metabolic and endocrine disease assets, VK5211, VK2809, VK0214, VK0612 and our earlier-stage assets, the EPOR and DGAT-1 programs. To date, no pivotal clinical trials designed to provide clinically and statistically significant proof of
	efficacy, or to provide sufficient evidence of safety to justify approval, have been completed with any of our drug candidates. All of our drug candidates will require additional development, including clinical trials as well as further preclinical
	studies to evaluate their toxicology, carcinogenicity and pharmacokinetics and optimize their formulation, and regulatory clearances before they can be commercialized. Positive results obtained during early development do not necessarily mean later
	development will succeed or that regulatory clearances will be obtained. Our drug development efforts may not lead to commercial drugs, either because our drug candidates fail to be safe and effective or because we have inadequate financial or other
	resources to advance our drug candidates through the clinical development and approval processes. If any of our drug candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy at any time or during any phase of development, we would experience potentially
	significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of the drug candidate.

	We do not anticipate that any of our current drug candidates will be
	eligible to receive regulatory approval from the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign authorities and begin commercialization for a number of years, if ever. Even if we ultimately receive regulatory approval for any of these drug candidates, we or our
	potential future partners, if any, may be unable to commercialize them successfully for a variety of reasons. These include, for example, the availability of alternative treatments, lack of cost-effectiveness, the cost of manufacturing the product
	on a commercial scale and competition with other drugs. The success of our drug candidates may also be limited by the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects. If we fail to commercialize one or more of our current drug candidates, we may
	be unable to generate sufficient revenues to attain or maintain profitability, and our financial condition and stock price may decline.

	and well-controlled clinical trials must be conducted to demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign authorities. In order to support marketing approval, these agencies typically require
	successful results in one or more Phase 3 clinical trials, which our current drug candidates have not yet reached and may never reach. The development process is expensive, can take many years and has an uncertain outcome. Failure can occur at any
	stage of the process. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the development process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future drug candidates, including the following:

	We licensed all of the intellectual property related to our drug candidates from Ligand pursuant to the Master License Agreement. We recently
	completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial for VK5211. All other clinical trials, preclinical studies and other analyses performed to date with respect to our drug candidates have been conducted by Ligand. Therefore,
	as a company, we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates. Since our experience with our drug candidates is limited, we will need to train our existing personnel and hire additional personnel in order to
	successfully administer and manage our clinical trials and other studies as planned, which may result in delays in completing such planned clinical trials and preclinical studies. Moreover, to date our drug candidates have been tested in less than
	the number of patients that will likely need to be studied to obtain regulatory approval. The data collected from clinical trials with larger patient populations may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to support regulatory approval of
	these drug candidates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We currently do not have strategic collaborations in place for clinical development of any of our current drug candidates.
	Therefore, in the future, we or any potential future collaborative partner will be responsible for establishing the targeted endpoints and goals for development of our drug candidates. These targeted endpoints and goals may be inadequate to
	demonstrate the safety and efficacy levels required for regulatory approvals. Even if we believe data collected during the development of our drug candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support marketing approval by the FDA,
	EMA or comparable foreign authorities. Further, data generated during development can be interpreted in different ways, and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign authorities may interpret such data in different ways than us or our collaborators. Our
	failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates would prevent our receipt of regulatory approval, and ultimately the potential commercialization of these drug candidates.

	We are a clinical-stage company, and the development and commercialization of our drug candidates is uncertain and
	expected to require substantial expenditures. We have not yet generated any revenues from our operations to fund our activities, and are therefore dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. The audit report issued by our
	independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 states that our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a
	going concern due to the risk that we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets at December&nbsp;31, 2015 to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next 12&nbsp;months; and in the event that sufficient cash cannot be obtained, we
	would have to substantially alter, or possibly even discontinue, operations. Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, and based upon our current operating plan, we do not believe that we will have
	sufficient cash to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months unless this offering is successfully completed. Our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus do not include any

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since we will be unable to generate sufficient, if any, cash flow to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, we may need to seek additional equity or

	There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms or at all. If such additional financing is not
	available on satisfactory terms, or is not available in sufficient amounts, we may be required to delay, limit or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our ability to achieve our business objectives, our competitiveness, and our
	business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we may be required to grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Our

	The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product
	candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy results despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered
	significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to adverse safety profiles or lack of efficacy, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies. Similarly, our future clinical trial results may not be successful for these or other reasons.

	This drug candidate development risk is heightened by any changes in the planned clinical trials compared to the completed clinical trials. As product
	candidates are developed through preclinical to early to late stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is customary that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing and methods of administration, are
	altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. While these types of changes are common and are intended to optimize the product candidates for late stage clinical trials, approval and commercialization, such changes carry the
	risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any of these changes could make the results of our planned clinical trials or other future

	jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.

	The clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of our drug candidates

	complexity and novelty of the drug candidates involved. Approval policies or regulations may change and may be influenced by the results of other similar or competitive products, making it more difficult for us to achieve such approval in a timely
	manner or at all. For example, the FDA has released draft guidance regarding clinical trials for drug candidates treating diabetes that may result in more stringent requirements for the clinical trials and regulatory approval of such drug
	candidates. This and any future guidance that may result from recent FDA advisory panel discussions may make it more expensive to develop and commercialize such drug candidates. Such increased expense could make it more difficult to obtain favorable
	terms in the collaborative arrangements we require to maximize the value of our programs seeking to develop new drug candidates for diabetes. In addition, as a company, we have not previously filed NDAs with the FDA or filed similar applications
	with other foreign regulatory agencies. This lack of experience may impede our ability to obtain FDA or other foreign regulatory agency approval in a timely manner, if at all, for our drug candidates for which development and commercialization is

	All entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing contract manufacturers for our drug

	contaminants or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our drug candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. We or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of an NDA or
	marketing authorization application, or MAA, on a timely basis and must adhere to good laboratory practice and cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign authorities through their facilities inspection program. Some of our

	Additionally, if supply from one manufacturer is interrupted, an alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified

	In addition, the potential market opportunity for our drug candidates is
	difficult to precisely estimate. Our estimates of the potential market opportunity for our drug candidates include several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research reports and other surveys.
	Independent sources have not verified all of our assumptions. If any of these assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for our drug candidates could be smaller than our estimates of our potential market opportunity. If the actual
	market for our drug candidates is smaller than we expect, our product revenue may be limited, it may be harder than expected to raise funds and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability. If we fail to achieve market
	acceptance of our drug candidates in the U.S. and abroad, our revenue will be limited and it will be more difficult to achieve profitability.

	There will be no viable commercial market for our drug candidates, if approved,
	without reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement policies may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for our current drug candidates or any other drug candidate we may
	develop. Additionally, even if there is a viable commercial market, if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our anticipated revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly question and challenge the coverage of and the prices
	charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors. Reimbursement rates may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be
	incorporated into existing payments for other services. There is a current trend in the U.S. healthcare industry toward cost containment.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Large public
	and private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party
	payors, including Medicare, may question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. In particular,
	third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. We believe our drugs will be priced
	significantly higher than existing generic drugs and consistent with current branded drugs. If we are unable to show a significant benefit relative to existing generic drugs, Medicare, Medicaid and private payors may not be willing to provide
	reimbursement for our drugs, which would significantly reduce the likelihood of our products gaining market acceptance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect that private insurers
	will consider the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, safety and tolerability of our potential products in determining whether to approve reimbursement for such products and at what level. Obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive
	process. Our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive approval for reimbursement of our potential products from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis.
	Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare carrier level or by fiscal intermediaries. Medicare Part D, which provides a pharmacy benefit to Medicare patients as discussed below, does not require participating prescription
	drug plans to cover all drugs within a class of products. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if Part D prescription drug plans were to limit access to, or deny or limit reimbursement
	of, our drug candidates or other potential products.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and
	reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many countries, the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to
	continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. The negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12&nbsp;months. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical
	trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies.

	If the prices for our potential products are reduced or if

	In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription
	Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could limit the coverage and reimbursement rate
	that we receive for any of our approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates.
	Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

	In
	March&nbsp;2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the PPACA, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce
	or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose
	additional health policy reforms. The PPACA increased manufacturers&#146; rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate amount for both branded and generic drugs and revised the definition of &#147;average
	manufacturer price,&#148; or AMP, which may also increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also expanded Medicaid drug rebates and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new
	formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the rebates due on those drugs. The Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, which administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, also has proposed to expand Medicaid
	rebates to the utilization that occurs in the territories of the U.S., such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Further, beginning in 2011, the PPACA imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription
	drug products and required manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the &#147;donut hole.&#148; Although it is too early to
	determine the full effects of the PPACA, the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.

	We currently have intellectual property rights to develop our drug candidates through a license from Ligand. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we did not own any

	addition, we may need to acquire or in-license additional intellectual property in the future. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other intellectual property rights from third parties that we
	identify as necessary for our drug candidates. We face competition with regard to acquiring and in-licensing third-party intellectual property rights, including from a number of more established companies. These established companies may have a
	competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license intellectual

	these types of proceedings, a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our licensed patents or any future patents we may own invalid or unenforceable. We may also fail to identify

	The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, ownership, priority, validity or
	enforceability. In this regard, third parties may challenge our licensed patents or any future patents we may own in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in
	patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent
	protection of our technology and potential products. In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such drug candidates might expire before or shortly

	Our commercial success depends
	significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our current or potential future drug candidates

	Moreover, patent applications
	are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent
	applications were filed. Because patents can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our drug candidates or potential products infringe. For example,
	pending applications may exist that claim or can be amended to claim subject matter that our drug candidates or potential products infringe. Competitors may file continuing patent applications claiming priority to already issued patents in the form
	of continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part applications, in order to maintain the pendency of a patent family and attempt to cover our drug candidates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization and may sue us for patent or other intellectual property
	infringement. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to
	demonstrate that our drug candidates, potential products or methods either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in
	the U.S., proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and
	attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful
	conclusion. If a court holds that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and cover our products or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our products unless we acquire or obtain a
	license under the applicable patents or until the patents expire.

	VK5211, without authority from either us or Ligand, and we may experience other potential intellectual property infringement in the future. Lawsuits to protect our intellectual property rights can be very time consuming and costly. There is a
	substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biopharmaceutical industry generally. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating expenses and reduce the resources

	In any infringement litigation, any award of monetary

	compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are resolved. Further,
	any claims we assert against a perceived infringer could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we have infringed their patents. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or
	proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to

	In addition, our licensed patents and patent applications, and patents and patent applications that we may own or license in

	narrowing of the scope of, any of our licensed patents and patent applications and patents and patent applications that we may own or license in the future subject to challenge. Any of these challenges, regardless of their success, would likely be

	technological and legal complexity and is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. For example, the U.S. has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform
	legislation. Specifically, on September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law and included a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These included changes in the way patent
	applications will be prosecuted, including a transition to a &#147;first-to-file&#148; system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention, and
	may also affect patent litigation. Under a &#147;first-to-file&#148; system, a third party that files a patent application with the USPTO before us could be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we made the invention before it was
	made by the third party. The USPTO has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in
	particular, the &#147;first-to-file&#148; provisions, became effective in March&nbsp;2013. The Leahy-Smith Act has also introduced procedures that may make it easier for third parties to challenge issued patents, as well as to intervene in the
	prosecution of patent applications. Finally, the Leahy-Smith Act contains new statutory provisions that still require the USPTO to issue new regulations for their implementation, and it may take the courts years to interpret the provisions of the
	new statute. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on our business, the cost of prosecuting our licensed and future patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our licensed and future patent
	applications and our ability to enforce or defend our licensed or future issued patents. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our licensed and future patent
	applications and the enforcement or defense of our licensed and future patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain
	circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the
	value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to
	enforce patents that we might obtain in the future.

	Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on drug candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our licensed and owned
	technologies in jurisdictions where we have not licensed or obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain or license patent protection, but where
	patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be
	effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual
	property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to
	biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our licensed patents and future patents we may own, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Further, the laws of some
	foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the U.S. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our licensed and owned intellectual property both in
	the U.S. and abroad. For example, China, where we currently have seven licensed patents and three licensed patent applications, currently affords less protection to a company&#146;s intellectual property than some other jurisdictions. As such, the
	lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in China may significantly increase our vulnerability as regards unauthorized

	Many countries, including European Union countries, India,
	Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we currently have an aggregate of 19&nbsp;licensed patents and
	13&nbsp;licensed patent applications and may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential

	patents that we may license or own may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent
	restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during drug development and the FDA regulatory review process. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug
	application, or IND (falling after issuance of the patent), and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining

	The application for patent term extension is subject to

	deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are
	unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain
	earlier approval of competing products, and our ability to generate revenues could be materially adversely affected.

	As a public company and particularly after we cease to

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing
	and success of preclinical studies, our ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future and the timing of regulatory submissions. The costs and timing of development activities, particularly conducting clinical trials and
	preclinical studies, are highly uncertain, subject to substantial risks and can often change. Depending on the outcome of these activities and other unforeseen events, our plans and priorities may change and we may apply the net proceeds of this
	offering in different proportions than we currently anticipate.

	The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business,

	Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations.
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5,890,000 for federal and $6,629,000 for state tax purposes, both of which
	will begin to expire in 2032. Our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In the event of an &#147;ownership change,&#148;
	Section&nbsp;382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income that may be offset with pre-ownership change net operating losses of the loss corporation experiencing the ownership change.&nbsp;An &#147;ownership
	change&#148; is defined by Section&nbsp;382 as a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Our initial public offering in May 2015 resulted in an &#147;ownership change&#148; of us. We performed an
	analysis and determined that, notwithstanding this ownership change, a significant portion of our federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards are available for utilization as of December 31, 2015. The full amounts of the $5,890,000
	federal and $6,629,000 state tax net operating loss carryforwards will be available for utilization as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. In addition, current or future changes in our stock ownership may trigger an &#147;ownership change,&#148; some of
	which may be outside our control. Accordingly, our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal taxable income, if any, will likely be limited by Section&nbsp;382, which could potentially result in increased future tax
	liability to us.

	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development,
	operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, under the Loan and Security Agreement with Ligand, we may not declare or pay dividends in respect of our
	common stock without Ligand&#146;s prior written consent. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.

	We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the common stock and related warrants that we are offering will be approximately $8.0&nbsp;million
	(or $9.2&nbsp;million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase approximately $1,350,000 of additional shares of our common stock and/or warrants in this offering in full), assuming a public offering price per share of common stock and

	proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants to be issued in this offering. If a warrant holder elects to exercise a warrant for cash, we will receive proceeds from such exercise. If a warrant holder exercises a warrant on a cashless basis,
	we will not receive any proceeds from such exercise. We cannot predict when or if the warrants will be exercised on a cash basis. It is possible that the warrants may expire and never be exercised.

	As of December 31, 2015, we had net tangible book value

	Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical
	company focused on the development of novel, first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. We have exclusive worldwide rights to a portfolio of five drug candidates in clinical trials or preclinical studies, which
	are based on small molecules licensed from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand. Our lead clinical program is VK5211, an orally available drug candidate, currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for acute rehabilitation following non-elective
	hip fracture surgery. Hip fracture is a common injury among persons aged 60 and older. The acute recovery period post-injury is characterized by significant and rapid declines in bone mineral density, or BMD, and lean body mass, or LBM, which
	contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality in these patients. VK5211 is a non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator, or SARM. A SARM is designed to selectively interact with a subset of receptors that have a normal physiologic role
	of interacting with naturally-occurring hormones called androgens. Broad activation of androgen receptors with drugs, such as exogenous testosterone, can stimulate muscle growth and improve BMD, but often results in unwanted side effects such as
	prostate growth, hair growth and acne. VK5211 is expected to selectively produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone in muscle and bone tissue, potentially accelerating rehabilitation and improving patient outcomes. VK5211 is also expected to
	have improved safety, tolerability and patient acceptance relative to testosterone. We commenced the Phase 2 clinical trial of VK5211 in October&nbsp;2015 and expect to complete enrollment in the trial in the second half of 2016 and complete the
	trial in the first quarter of 2017.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our second clinical program is VK2809, an orally available, tissue and receptor-subtype selective agonist of the
	thyroid hormone receptor beta, or TR&szlig;, that is entering Phase 2 development for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease. VK2809 belongs to a family of novel prodrugs which are cleaved
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	to
	release potent thyromimetics. Selective activation of the TR&szlig; receptor in liver tissue is believed to favorably affect cholesterol and lipoprotein levels via multiple mechanisms, including increasing the expression of low-density lipoprotein
	receptors and increasing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. We expect to commence the Phase 2 clinical trial of VK2809 in the first half of 2016 and to complete the trial in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also developing VK0214 for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, or X-ALD, a rare X-linked, inherited neurological disorder characterized by a breakdown in
	the protective barriers surrounding brain and nerve cells. The disease, for which there is no approved treatment, is caused by mutations in a peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids, or VLCFA, known as ABCD1. As a result, transporter
	function is impaired and patients are unable to efficiently metabolize VLCFA. The TR&szlig; receptor is known to regulate expression of an alternative VLCFA transporter, known as ABCD2. Various preclinical models have demonstrated that increased
	expression of ABCD2 can lead to normalization of VLCFA metabolism. Preliminary
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	data suggest that VK0214 stimulates ABCD2 expression. We are conducting studies of VK0214 in an
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	model of disease. Pending completion of
	this work, we expect in 2016 to commence work directed toward filing an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND.

	We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September&nbsp;24, 2012. Since our incorporation,
	we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to raising capital, building infrastructure and obtaining the worldwide rights to certain technology, including VK5211, VK2809 and VK0214, pursuant to an exclusive license agreement with Ligand
	Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand. The terms of this license agreement are detailed in the Master License Agreement, or the Master License Agreement, with Ligand, which we entered into on May&nbsp;21, 2014 and amended on each of
	September&nbsp;6, 2014 and April&nbsp;8, 2015. A summary of the Master License Agreement, as amended, can be found in the section of this prospectus entitled &#147;Business&nbsp;&#151;Agreements with Ligand&nbsp;&#151;Master License Agreement&#148;.

	On May&nbsp;4, 2015, we completed our initial public offering of our common stock, or the IPO, pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 that was
	declared effective on April&nbsp;28, 2015. In the IPO, we sold 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at an initial public offering price of $8.00 per share. The underwriters for the IPO had 30&nbsp;days to exercise an over-allotment option to
	purchase up to an additional 450,000 shares at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discount. Upon the closing of the IPO, on May&nbsp;4, 2015, we raised a total of $19,100,500 in net proceeds after deducting underwriting
	discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of $4,899,500.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On May&nbsp;26, 2015, the underwriters of the IPO exercised their full over-allotment
	option to purchase an additional 450,000 shares of our common stock. On May&nbsp;28, 2015, we sold the 450,000 shares to the underwriters pursuant to the over-allotment option and received additional net proceeds of $3,225,866 after deducting
	underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of $374,134.

	Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, and based upon our current operating plan, we do not believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months unless we raise additional capital. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $45,545,445. These losses have resulted principally from research and development costs incurred in connection with acquiring the exclusive worldwide rights to the portfolio of five drug
	candidates discussed above and the related non-cash interest expense recorded for increases in the deemed fair market value for the license fees payable to Ligand, research and development expenses related to the manufacturing of clinical drug
	product and clinical development of VK5211, VK2809 and VK0214, consulting fees and general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our clinical
	drug candidates and preclinical programs and incur additional costs associated with being a public company.

	expense during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 as a cost of acquiring these assets. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we charged $6,966,842 to research and development expense as following the IPO, we began manufacturing certain

	The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and the successful development of our drug

	Our
	management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
	preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as
	well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to the fair value of the debt conversion liability, preclinical, nonclinical and clinical development costs
	and drug manufacturing costs. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of
	assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

<I>
	Revenue Recognition &#150; Milestone Method,
</I>
	or ASC 605-28, established the milestone method as an acceptable method of revenue recognition for certain contingent event-based payments under research and development arrangements. Under the
	milestone method, a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. A milestone is an event (1)&nbsp;that can be achieved based in whole or in
	part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance, (2)&nbsp;for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved, and
	(3)&nbsp;that would result in additional payments being due to us. The determination that a milestone is substantive is subject to management&#146;s judgment and is made at the inception of the arrangement. Milestones are considered substantive when
	the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone (a)&nbsp;is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our
	performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;relates solely to past performance, and (c)&nbsp;is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement.

	Other income (expense) increased during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 primarily due to the establishment in

	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical
	company focused on the development of novel, first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. We have exclusive worldwide rights to a portfolio of five drug candidates in clinical trials or preclinical studies, which
	are based on small molecules licensed from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand. Details regarding our license agreement with Ligand are discussed in the section of this Prospectus entitled &#147;&#151;Agreements with Ligand&#148;.

	Our lead clinical program is VK5211, an orally available drug candidate, currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for acute rehabilitation following non-elective
	hip fracture surgery. Hip fracture is a common injury among persons aged 60 and older. The acute recovery period post-injury is characterized by significant and rapid declines in bone mineral density, or BMD, and lean body mass, or LBM, which
	contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality in these patients. VK5211 is a non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator, or SARM. A SARM is designed to selectively interact with a subset of receptors that have a normal physiologic role
	of interacting with naturally-occurring hormones called androgens. Broad activation of androgen receptors with drugs, such as exogenous testosterone, can stimulate muscle growth and improve BMD, but often results in unwanted side effects such as
	prostate growth, hair growth and acne. VK5211 is expected to selectively produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone in muscle and bone tissue, potentially accelerating rehabilitation and improving patient outcomes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We expect VK5211 to produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone, including increased LBM and BMD, with improved safety, tolerability and patient
	acceptance due to a tissue-selective mechanism of action and an oral route of administration. Tissue selectivity is particularly important in treating patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery, as these patients experience
	abnormally elevated losses of muscle tissue and BMD. This results in a loss of muscle strength, an increased risk of additional fractures and increased mortality. We believe the selective stimulation of androgen receptors in muscle and bone provides
	an attractive therapeutic approach for patients recovering from hip fractures. In Phase 1 clinical trials, VK5211 demonstrated statistically significant increases in LBM among treated subjects following 21&nbsp;days of treatment. Statistically
	significant refers to a low probability, generally regarded as less than or equal to 5%, of obtaining the observed result under a hypothesis that assumes no difference between treatment groups. We also observed positive dose-dependent trends in
	functional exercise and strength measures consistent with anabolic activity. In addition, no drug-related serious adverse events were reported. In an established animal model of osteoporosis, treatment with VK5211 resulted in significant increases
	in BMD and bone strength. In October&nbsp;2015, we commenced enrollment for a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery, and we expect to enroll a total of&nbsp;120 patients
	and&nbsp;complete enrollment in this clinical trial in the second half of 2016. We also plan to discuss with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, potential clinical development of VK5211 in other acute use settings, such as cancer
	cachexia.

	Hip fractures occur in over 300,000 persons in the U.S. annually. Most hip fractures occur in the elderly, often resulting from minimal trauma,
	such as a fall from standing height. Unfortunately, elderly individuals are at higher risk of substantial morbidity and mortality due to these fractures as a result of higher rates of frailty and undernourishment. Furthermore, the rate of hip
	fracture is known to increase with age, doubling every 5-6 years after age 60. Hip fractures can lead to devastating consequences. Disability frequently results from persistent pain and limited physical mobility. Hip fractures are associated with
	substantial morbidity and mortality, with approximately 15%-20% of patients dying within one year of fracture. There are currently no approved therapies in the U.S. for restoration or preservation of LBM, BMD or physical function in patients who
	have suffered a hip fracture. Pharmacological interventions, including with steroids, have demonstrated limited clinical benefit or expose patients to the risk of undesirable side-effects, such as virilization in women and prostate growth in men. We
	believe the potential size of the worldwide hip fracture treatment market for a SARM exceeds $1.0&nbsp;billion annually.

	Our second program is focused on the development of orally available small molecule thyroid hormone receptor
	beta, or TR&szlig;, agonists. Our two lead molecules are VK2809 and VK0214. We believe selective TR&szlig; agonists have the potential to treat a variety of lipid disorders. Thyroid hormone receptors are found in several tissues throughout the body.
	The TR&szlig; isoform is the major receptor subtype expressed in the liver and the TR
<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">
	&#097;
</FONT>
	isoform is the major subtype expressed in the heart. Selective activation of the TR&szlig; receptor in liver tissue
	is believed to favorably affect cholesterol and lipoprotein levels via multiple mechanisms, including increasing the expression of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, receptors and increasing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. These characteristics in
	turn lead to reductions of LDL cholesterol, or LDL-C, plasma and liver triglycerides. We are developing VK2809 for the potential treatment of hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease. We are developing VK0214 for the potential treatment of
	X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, or X-ALD. We believe our selective TR&szlig; agonists are capable of achieving this unique lipid lowering profile without eliciting unwanted effects on the heart and thyroid hormone axis.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	VK2809 is an orally available, tissue and receptor-subtype selective agonist of the thyroid beta receptor, or TR&szlig;, that is entering Phase 2 development
	for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease. VK2809 belongs to a family of novel prodrugs which are cleaved

	to release potent thyromimetics.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial, patients with mild hypercholesterolemia who were treated with VK2809 at doses of 5 mg and above
	experienced significant placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions from baseline, ranging from approximately 15%-41%. In addition, placebo-adjusted triglyceride levels were reduced by more than 30% at doses of 2.5 mg and above. There were no serious adverse
	events observed in this trial, and no differences in heart rate, heart rhythm or blood pressure were observed between VK2809 and placebo-treated patients. In addition, VK2809 has demonstrated significant reductions in liver fat content in multiple
	animal models of fatty liver disease, suggesting potential efficacy in the setting of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We plan to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial of VK2809 in approximately 100 patients with hypercholesterolemia and fatty
	liver disease in the first half of 2016 and to complete this clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.

	In the U.S., the
	number of patients with dyslipidemia was estimated to be greater than 100&nbsp;million in 2013. In the U.S., 33.5% of adults, or 71.0&nbsp;million people, have high LDL-C. NASH is a growing epidemic in the U.S., and is quickly becoming a leading
	cause of cirrhosis and liver failure. It is estimated that NASH affects 2% to 5% of Americans, or 6.0 to 15.0&nbsp;million people. As a result, we believe the global market opportunity for VK2809 in hypercholesterolemia or NASH exceeds $1.0 billion.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also developing VK0214 for X-ALD, a rare X-linked, inherited neurological disorder characterized by a breakdown in the protective barriers
	surrounding brain and nerve cells. The disease is caused by mutations in a peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids, or VLCFA, known as the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter D1, or ABCD1. As a result, transporter
	function is impaired and patients are unable to efficiently metabolize VLCFA. The TR&szlig; receptor is known to regulate expression of an alternative VLCFA transporter, known as ABCD2. Various preclinical models have demonstrated that increased
	expression of ABCD2 can lead to normalization of VLCFA metabolism. Preliminary
<I>
	in vitro
</I>
	data suggest that VK0214 stimulates ABCD2 expression. We are conducting studies of VK0214 in an
<I>
	in vivo
</I>
	model of disease. Pending completion of
	this work, we expect in 2016 to commence work directed toward filing an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND.

	X-ALD is a rare, often fatal
	condition believed to occur with an incidence of approximately one in 17,000 births. X-ALD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for ABCD1, which is located on the X chromosome. Men have one X chromosome, while women have two copies. Because
	of this, an inherited mutation in the ABCD1 gene is more likely to manifest in males relative to females. The ABCD1 protein plays a critical role in the transport of VLCFA into a cellular organelle called the peroxisome, where VLCFA metabolism and
	disposal occur. Without functional ABCD1, VLCFA accumulate in cells, including neural cells, where they can lead to

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our lead clinical program, VK5211, is an
	orally available, non-steroidal SARM in development for the treatment of patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery. VK5211 is designed to selectively produce the therapeutic benefits of testosterone in muscle and bone tissue with
	improved safety and tolerability. Tissue selectivity is critical in treating patients recovering from hip fracture. These patients experience elevated rates of metabolic breakdown of muscle tissue and loss of BMD. This results in a loss of muscle
	strength, an increased risk of additional fractures and increased mortality. Androgens, such as testosterone, are hormones that stimulate a variety of physiologic processes, including muscle, bone, hair and prostate growth. However,
	testosterone&#146;s lack of selectivity can produce undesirable side effects such as prostate growth in men, and hair growth and masculinization in women.

	Androgens and Androgen Receptors

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Androgens are important
	for the proper regulation of the reproductive system, and play critical roles in the homeostasis of the muscular, skeletal, cardiovascular, metabolic and central nervous systems. The most predominant androgen hormone is testosterone. Testosterone is
	predominately produced in the testes in men and in the adrenal glands and ovaries in women, albeit at lower levels than in men. Testosterone stimulates the growth of muscle and bone, also known as anabolic effects, as well as the growth of the
	prostate and sebaceous gland, also known as androgenic effects and, as such, testosterone is considered a non-tissue-selective androgen.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While
	testosterone preparations are widely used for the treatment of male hypogonadism, the androgenic activity of testosterone limits its use in women and in elderly men who have a higher risk of developing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, a benign
	increase in prostate size, and prostate cancer. In men, the lack of selectivity of anabolic steroids may result in side effects such as acne, hair loss and progression of BPH and/or prostate cancer. In women, exposure to exogenous testosterone can
	be associated with hair growth, acne and masculinization. Furthermore, testosterone must be administered by intramuscular injections, transdermal patches or gels. These routes of administration can be inconvenient or associated with potential safety
	issues. We believe VK5211&#146;s selectivity, limited off-target effects and convenient route of administration may make it superior to off-label testosterone for treating hip fracture and other muscle wasting disorders.

	SARMs are a class of small molecules designed to elicit the benefits of androgens on tissues such as muscle and bone, without the undesirable effects on
	prostate and sebaceous glands, by selectively activating androgen receptors in certain tissues. We believe that, based on their robust activity on muscle and bone, SARMs can be used for the potential treatment of a number of diseases or disorders,
	including hip fracture, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, frailty and hormone deficiency in both men and women in cases where testosterone supplements or anabolic steroid treatments are ineffective or where the side effect profile is inappropriate.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial for acute rehabilitation following non-elective hip fracture surgery. More than 300,000 patients in the
	U.S. experience hip fractures each year, and approximately 50% lose the ability to live independently following the injury. The number of hip fractures is expected to grow in the U.S. as the population ages. Due to required limitations in mobility
	following hip fracture, patients experience muscle atrophy, or deterioration from lack of use, which impacts the time required for rehabilitation to restore physical function. We believe VK5211&#146;s potential stimulatory effect on lean body mass
	could result in benefits to patients recovering from hip fracture or other conditions requiring orthopedic intervention, such as hip or knee replacement surgery. Currently, there are no approved therapies to assist in the maintenance or restoration

	The tissue-selectivity of VK5211 was examined in a castrated rat model. The castrated rat model is a standard animal model
	for examining tissue selectivity for SARMs due to the rapid nature of muscle atrophy in castrated animals and the high sensitivity to muscle growth upon androgen-based treatment. Muscle mass can be restored with a potent androgen-receptor agonist,
	such as testosterone. Initially, rats are castrated or receive sham surgery. Sham rats are rats that receive surgical procedures that do not remove the ovaries or have other physiologic purposes. Upon recovering from the surgery, castrated and sham
	rats are administered either an active therapy such as VK5211 or testosterone. The effects of therapy in this model are assessed by measuring muscle and prostate tissue mass. Muscle mass in castrated animals treated with vehicle is assigned 0%
	relative efficacy, while muscle mass in non-castrated animals that underwent sham surgery is assigned 100% relative efficacy. For example, a castrated rat treated with a drug that demonstrates 100% relative efficacy would have equivalent tissue mass
	to a non-castrated rat.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In this model, VK5211 demonstrated greater than 500-fold selectivity for maintaining muscle weight at non-castrate levels
	relative to the effects on prostate weight. By comparison, testosterone shows similar effects on both muscle and prostate tissue. These data suggest that VK5211 is highly tissue-selective for muscle, potentially leading to an improved therapeutic

	Future Opportunity in Cancer Cachexia
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cachexia is a complex disease characterized by an uncontrolled decline in muscle mass. Patients suffering from cachexia experience increased rates of metabolic
	breakdown of muscle tissue, resulting in a loss of muscle strength and reduced body weight. The condition is often found secondary to an underlying disease, such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure and HIV/AIDS. It is
	estimated that a combined total of approximately 9.0&nbsp;million people suffer from cachexia in the U.S., Europe and Japan. A combination of factors tied to the underlying disease, including reduced growth factor production and overproduction of
	inflammatory and apoptosis, or cell-death, mediators, create an imbalance in muscle formation and degradation. The resulting dysregulation and associated weight loss leads to increased mortality rates in affected patients. Common clinical symptoms
	include decline in physical function and impaired immune function, which contribute to increased disability, fatigue, diminished quality of life and reduced rate of survival.

	Although muscle wasting associated with cancer can be partially attributed to nutritional deficiencies, the use
	of appetite stimulants and nutritional interventions are generally ineffective. This is likely due to the failure of these approaches to address the underlying catabolic processes contributing to muscle wasting. Additionally, cancer patients with
	severe weight loss, poor performance status and metastatic disease who no longer respond to therapy may be less likely to respond to single therapies designed to increase muscle mass and improve physical function. Because muscle wasting, which often
	leads to refractory cachexia, has significant negative impacts on patients and their families, early intervention with therapeutic agents aimed at stimulating muscle mass is critically important.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Approximately 2.0&nbsp;million cancer patients in North America and Europe suffer from cachexia, and it is estimated that up to 20% of all cancer deaths are a
	direct result of cachexia. It is particularly common among patients with lung, gastric, colorectal or pancreatic cancers, with up to 80% of patients with gastric or pancreatic cancers, and approximately 50% of patients with lung or colorectal
	cancers, suffering from the syndrome. There are currently no approved therapies in the U.S. for cancer cachexia, and pharmacological interventions have demonstrated limited clinical benefit or expose patients to the risk of undesirable side-effects
	such as virilization in women and prostate growth in men. As a result, we believe the potential size of the worldwide cancer cachexia market exceeds $1.0&nbsp;billion.

	Pending approval of VK5211 in the acute hip fracture setting, we may seek to pursue label expansion for VK5211 in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC,
	patients with cachexia. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 224,000 patients in the U.S. are projected to be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014, of which approximately 85% of these cases are expected to be NSCLC. At diagnosis,
	approximately half of NSCLC patients present with some form of muscle wasting syndrome. Muscle wasting in this population is associated with reduced strength, increased fatigue and a decrease in overall quality of life. In addition, data indicate
	that lean body mass may correlate with overall survival, suggesting a potential link between improvement in lean body mass and survival. We believe VK5211 may benefit a large segment of the NSCLC patient population, due to the drug&#146;s potential

	plasma LDL-C of at least 100 mg/dL. This study was initiated in 2007 and completed in 2008. VK2809 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated across doses ranging from 0.25 mg to 40 mg per day. There were no serious adverse events, and the frequency of
	adverse events in VK2809-treated subjects was similar to placebo-treated subjects. No differences in heart rate, heart rhythm or blood

	hormone levels. The clinical trial results also showed dose-related reductions in fasting LDL-C and fasting triglyceride, or TG, levels at day 14. Significant placebo-adjusted LDL-C reductions from baseline were observed at doses of 5 mg and above
	and ranged from approximately 15%-41%, while placebo-adjusted TG levels were reduced by more than 30% at doses of 2.5 mg and above. In addition, statistically significant reductions of lipoprotein a (Lp(a)) and apolipoprotein (Apo(B)), which are
	believed to be positively associated with a patient&#146;s risk of developing cardiovascular disease, were observed in certain cohorts. We believe these preliminary results compare favorably with the lipid lowering activities of existing oral agents

	VK2809, which is our most advanced
	TR&szlig; agonist, is a potent small molecule that is selective for the TR&szlig; receptor compared with the alpha receptor. VK2809 has an equilibrium dissociation constant Ki, which refers to the concentration of drug required to occupy 50% of
	available TR&szlig; receptors, of approximately 2 nanomoles per liter, and has approximately 16:1 selectivity for the beta receptor over the alpha receptor. VK2809 has demonstrated cholesterol-lowering activity in five animal species. In addition,
	VK2809 has demonstrated additive cholesterol lowering activity when combined with atorvastatin, an approved and widely prescribed medication for lowering cholesterol. Treatment of rodents with VK2809 also led to a beneficial reduction in liver fat
	content. For example, histologic evaluation of liver tissue, as well as quantitative data showing liver triglyceride content was reduced by more than 40% in some rodent models of hepatic steatosis, demonstrated encouraging preliminary signs of
	efficacy in the reduction of liver fat. We believe the reduction of liver fat content results suggest a potential benefit in diseases characterized by excessive accumulation of lipids in liver tissue, such as NASH. We believe the totality of results
	from our TR&szlig; agonist program suggest that VK2809 possesses an attractive profile for potential future development in a variety of lipid disorders, including dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and NASH.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are developing VK0214 for X-ALD, a rare X-linked, inherited neurological disorder characterized by a breakdown in the protective barriers surrounding brain
	and nerve cells. The disease, for which there is no approved treatment, is caused by mutations in a peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids, or VLCFA, known as ABCD1. As a result, transporter function is impaired and patients are
	unable to efficiently metabolize VLCFA. VK0214 is a novel selective TR&szlig; agonist. TR&szlig; is known to regulate expression of an alternative VLCFA transporter, known as ABCD2. Various preclinical models have demonstrated that increased
	expression of ABCD2 can lead to normalization of VLCFA metabolism. Preliminary
<I>
	in vitro

	data suggest that VK0214 stimulates ABCD2 expression. We are conducting studies of VK0214 in an

	X-ALD is a rare, often fatal condition believed to occur with an incidence
	of approximately one in 17,000 births. X-ALD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for ABCD1, which is located on the X chromosome. Men have one X chromosome, while women have two copies. Because of this, an inherited mutation in the ABCD1
	gene is more likely to manifest in males relative to females. The ABCD1 protein plays a critical role in the transport of VLCFA into a cellular organelle called the peroxisome, where VLCFA metabolism and disposal occur. Without functional ABCD1,
	VLCFA accumulate in cells, including neural cells, where they can lead to membrane disruption and damage to the myelin sheath, a protective and insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. This damage can result in decreased motor
	coordination and function, visual and hearing disturbances, the loss of cognitive function, dementia, seizures, adrenal dysfunction and other complications, including death. X-ALD is divided into various sub-segments, which are broadly characterized
	by the presence or absence of brain inflammation:

	ages of 20 and 35 years. In male children affected by CALD, learning and behavioral problems are often the first clinical manifestations of disease. In the absence of intervention, patients affected by CALD typically experience rapid degeneration

	generally present with slowly progressive symptoms resulting from (non-inflammatory) disruption of the axons, which are a fundamental component of the central nervous system (which allows nerve signals to be transmitted), in the spinal cord.
	Patients experience a variety of symptoms, including weakness in the legs, impaired vibration sense, incontinence and impotence. Severe motor disability, requiring the use of a wheelchair or cane, develops over a 3 to 15 year period. Many patients

	There is a clear unmet medical need for patients suffering from X-ALD. CALD has been more commonly targeted for treatment due to its devastating effects, which
	are often manifested at a young age. For these patients, the only currently effective treatment option is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell, or HSC, transplant. In this procedure, the patient is treated with HSCs containing the properly functioning
	copy of the ABCD1 gene, contributed by a donor other than the patient. Additionally, a method of ex vivo insertion of a functional copy of the ABCD1 gene via an HIV-1 based lentiviral vector into the patient&#146;s own HSCs to correct the aberrant
	expression of ABCD1 in patients with CALD is also in development. Over time with either method, as the transplanted cells grow and repopulate, a partial restoration of ABCD1 function can be achieved, leading many patients to resolution of
	progression in the cerebral form of the disease. While these forms of genetic correction have also shown potential clinical benefits, there is currently no approved therapy for X-ALD. In addition, recent data suggest that, even among successfully
	transplanted patients, AMN can develop. We believe our thyroid receptor agonists, which have the potential to normalize metabolism of VLCFAs peripherally, and potentially centrally, may positively impact all forms of X-ALD, including the currently
	untreatable AMN form.

	risk of adverse cardiovascular complications in patients with kidney disease when used to increase hemoglobin levels above 13.0 g/dL, and may be related to an increase in mortality in cancer patients. We believe that our drug candidates have the
	potential to treat anemia with improved safety, tolerability and route of administration. We plan to conduct further preclinical studies and file an IND with the FDA at a future date.

	We are developing small molecule inhibitors of the enzyme DGAT-1 for the potential treatment of lipid disorders such as obesity and dyslipidemia. According to

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we
	believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including commercial biopharmaceutical enterprises, academic institutions,
	government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical
	trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our
	competitors may succeed in developing technologies and therapies that are more effective, better tolerated or less costly than any which we are developing, or that would render our drug candidates obsolete and noncompetitive. Even if we obtain
	regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products earlier than we do. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified
	scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in acquiring and in-licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, tolerability, frequency

	earlier to occur of an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement or the Note, or May&nbsp;21, 2017, or the Maturity Date, unless the loans are repaid in cash or converted into equity prior to such time. Upon the consummation of our
	first bona fide capital financing transaction occurring after January&nbsp;22, 2016, but prior to the Maturity Date, with aggregate net proceeds to us of at least $2,000,000, or the Next Financing, we will be required to repay&nbsp;$1,500,000 of the
	Ligand Note obligation to Ligand, with at least&nbsp;$300,000 of such payment to be paid in cash (with any greater cash amount determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion), and the balance of the $1,500,000&nbsp;payment, or the Balance, to
	be paid in the form of such number of shares of our equity securities that are issued in the Next Financing equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the Balance by the lesser of (1)&nbsp;the lowest price per share paid by investors in the Next
	Financing, or the Financing Price, and (2)&nbsp;$8.00 (subject to adjustment for stock dividends, splits, combinations or similar transactions). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of shares that we may issue to Ligand will be reduced to the
	extent that the issuance of such shares would increase Ligand&#146;s beneficial ownership of our common stock to greater than 49.9%, and any remaining amount of the Balance would have to be paid in cash. Each&nbsp;$1.00 of the $1,500,000 payment
	will reduce the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and then unpaid principal amount of the loans under the Ligand Note by&nbsp;$0.50.

	Additional Repayment Notice, specifying the amount that we wish to repay, or the Additional Payment Amount. Ligand will have five days to elect to receive the Additional Payment Amount in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and
	shares of our common stock. If Ligand does not make an election within such five-day period, the form of the Additional Payment Amount will be at our sole election and discretion, subject to the number of shares of common stock being reduced to the
	extent that the issuance of shares would increase Ligand&#146;s beneficial ownership of our common stock to greater than&nbsp;49.9%. To the extent that any portion of an Additional Payment Amount will be paid in the form of shares of our common

	In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, or FDCA, and related regulations.
	Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval may subject an
	applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions and non-approval of drug candidates. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, of a clinical hold on clinical trials, the FDA&#146;s refusal to
	approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement,

	Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, an IND, which contains the results of preclinical studies along with other information, such as information about

	questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive
	clinical trial to be conducted during drug development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the investigational plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site.
	Informed written consent must also be obtained from each trial subject. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds,

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the
	FDA&#146;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment (currently exceeding $2.3&nbsp;million for fiscal year 2016) unless a waiver or
	exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical studies, or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed
	information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or
	from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the development of a new drug,
	sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 clinical trials, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These
	meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the
	end-of-Phase 2 clinical trials meetings to discuss their Phase 2 clinical trials results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 registration trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical safety studies and must also develop additional information about the
	chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for the NDA sponsor&#146;s manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches
	of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to
	demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The results of drug development, non-clinical
	studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting
	approval to market the product. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In
	this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60&nbsp;days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to
	determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA&#146;s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews
	the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength,
	quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs within 12&nbsp;months from submission of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months
	to consider certain late submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the

	or additional clinical, non-clinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. If, or
	when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of
	information included. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or effectiveness to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for
	review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when
	making decisions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve
	the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an
	NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP regulations. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies
	and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP regulations, the FDA may
	determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the
	application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a
	product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can
	provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA now has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency. See the section of this prospectus
	entitled &#147;&#151;Post-Marketing Requirements&#148;.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or a REMS, from
	manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Based on statutory standards,
	elements of a REMS may include &#147;dear doctor letters,&#148; a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use, or ETASU, which is the most restrictive REMS. ETASU can include, but are
	not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in
	some cases if consensus is not obtained until after the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, as amended, review cycle, the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities,
	require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same

	compensate for time lost during drug development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date
	of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations,
	however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the
	patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

	In seeking approval for a drug

	then published in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug
	product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for
	bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as

	The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book. Specifically, the
	applicant must certify that: (1)&nbsp;the required patent information has not been filed; (2)&nbsp;the listed patent has expired; (3)&nbsp;the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent
	expiration; or (4)&nbsp;the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any
	language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the

	accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be

	studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only
	the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a

	In the U.S., once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by
	the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific, approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of
	our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct
	any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic
	unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP
	compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are
	responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the
	discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such product or may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA,

	In addition, the manufacturer or sponsor under an approved NDA is

	The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, also known as Phase 4 testing, REMS to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an

	judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, withdrawal of approval, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly-discovered or developed
	safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#146;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government

	The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare
	Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part&nbsp;D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient
	prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies
	which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
	Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive
	regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare

	In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug

	the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product
	on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products

	The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for
	states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer&#146;s covered outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical
	manufacturers&#146; rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for &#147;line
	extensions&#148; (
<I>
	i.e.

	, new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The PPACA
	also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid
	drug benefits, to be phased-in by 2014. The CMS have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the U.S. as well. In addition, the PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted

	drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount
	to increase.

	Under the Best
	Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or the BPCA, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the
	drug in children. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA&#146;s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for
	pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that
	information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits
	that designation confers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for
	such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would need to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written
	agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will
	benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with, and are responsive to, the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and
	that the reports comply with the FDA&#146;s filing requirements.

	Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or the PREA, an NDA or supplement
	thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation
	for which the product is safe and effective. The PREA also authorizes the FDA to require holders of approved NDAs for marketed drugs to conduct pediatric studies under certain circumstances. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration
	Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including
	study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA&#146;s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and

	Our board of directors has adopted a compensation policy for our non-employee directors that consists of annual retainer fees and long-term equity awards.
	Under this policy, each non-employee director will receive an annual retainer of $33,170 for serving on our board of directors. The Chairperson of our board of directors will receive an additional annual retainer of $32,800, the chairperson of the
	audit committee will receive an additional annual retainer of $16,650, the chairperson of the compensation committee will receive an additional annual retainer of $11,350 and the chairperson of the nominating and corporate governance committee will

	each other member of the nominating and corporate governance committee will receive an additional annual retainer of $4,900. All cash retainers will be earned on a quarterly basis based on a calendar quarter, and, if applicable, will be prorated for
	the portion of the calendar quarter during which such non-employee director actually serves on our board of directors or a committee thereof, and will be paid in arrears no later than the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition to cash fees, each non-employee director will be granted on the first business day of each calendar year a stock option to purchase 16,000 shares
	of our common stock. If a non-employee director joins our board of directors other than at an annual meeting of our stockholders, such non-employee director will be granted on the date such individual first becomes appointed or elected as a
	non-employee director (1)&nbsp;a stock option to purchase 32,000 shares of our common stock and (2)&nbsp;a stock option to purchase 16,000 shares of our common stock, reduced pro rata for each day prior to the date of grant that has elapsed since
	January&nbsp;1st of the year in which the individual first becomes a non-employee director. Annual equity awards and equity awards granted to new non-employee directors will vest in full on the one-year anniversary of the applicable date of grant,

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Each initial equity award and each annual equity award will have a maximum term of

	These amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of option awards granted to each listed director in 2015, computed in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance. These amounts do not represent the
	actual amounts paid to or realized by the directors during 2015. The value as of the grant date for stock options is recognized over the number of days of service required for the stock option to vest in full. The option awards will vest on the date
	of our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders. For purposes of determining the grant date fair value, we estimated that option awards would vest on April 28, 2016, one year from the date of grant. For a detailed description of the assumptions used for
	purposes of determining grant date fair value, see Note 8 to the financial statements included in the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.

	2014 Equity Incentive Plan
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our board of directors
	adopted the Viking Therapeutics, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, on July&nbsp;2, 2014, and our stockholders approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan on August&nbsp;1, 2014. The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan became
	effective on April&nbsp;28, 2015. The following is only a summary of the material terms of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, is not a complete description of all provisions of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and should be read in conjunction with the
	2014 Equity Incentive Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.

<I>
	Purpose
</I>
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan is to enhance our ability to attract highly qualified personnel, to strengthen our
	retention capabilities, to enhance our long-term performance and competitiveness, and to align the interests of the participants of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan with those of our stockholders.

<I>
	Plan Administration
</I>
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee, although our board of directors may at
	any time act in lieu of the compensation committee; however, (1)&nbsp;in the case of awards intended to satisfy the requirements of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, the committee administering such
	awards will consist of two or more &#147;outside directors&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, and (2)&nbsp;in the case of awards made to an employee, director or consultant who is required to file reports with respect to
	such individual&#146;s &#147;beneficial ownership&#148; of our capital stock with the SEC pursuant to Section&nbsp;16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the committee administering such awards will consist of two or more
	directors who are &#147;non-employee directors&#148; within the meaning of Rule 16b-3. The compensation committee may also delegate to one or more of our officers the authority to (a)&nbsp;designate employees (other than other officers) to be
	recipients of certain stock awards, and (b)&nbsp;determine the number of shares of common stock to be subject to such stock awards, in each case subject to certain conditions. In connection with administering the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, the
	compensation committee has responsibility for determining, among other things, the recipient of each award, the type of award, the number of shares, units or dollars subject to each award and the terms and conditions of each award, including the
	exercise or purchase price and the vesting and duration of the award, and the terms for any modification, substitution or cancellation of awards, subject to certain conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, we have agreed
	to indemnify any individuals who take action on behalf of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, so long as such action is taken in good faith, for any claims, liabilities and costs arising out of such individual&#146;s good faith performance of duties on
	behalf of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, and to reimburse any such individual for all expenses incurred with respect to the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Types of Awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</I>
	The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan provides that the compensation committee may grant or issue stock options, stock
	appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and unrestricted shares, deferred share units, performance and cash-settled awards and dividend equivalent rights to participants under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Under the 2014
	Equity Incentive Plan, the compensation committee may establish an exchange program and grant replacement awards, in each case in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and applicable law (including any associated stockholder
	approval requirements).

	for awards of ISOs (as described under &#147;Stock Options&#148; below). The number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan will, unless otherwise determined by our
	board of directors or the compensation committee, be automatically increased on January&nbsp;1st of each year commencing on January&nbsp;1, 2016 and ending on (and including) January&nbsp;1, 2024, in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total number of
	shares of our common stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31st of the preceding calendar year. The shares of common stock deliverable pursuant to awards under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan will be authorized but unissued shares of our common stock,
	or shares of our common stock that we otherwise hold in treasury or in trust. Any shares of our common stock underlying awards that are settled in cash or otherwise expire, or are forfeited, terminated or cancelled (including pursuant to an exchange
	program established by the compensation committee) prior to the issuance of stock will again be available for issuance under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. In addition, shares of our common stock that are withheld (or not issued) in payment of the
	exercise price or taxes relating to an award, and shares of our common stock equal to the number surrendered in payment of any exercise price or withholding taxes relating to an award, will again be available for issuance under the 2014 Equity

	Eligibility
</I>
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation committee will select participants from among our employees, directors and consultants,
	including non-employees and non-consultants to whom an offer of employment or a consulting role has been or is being extended by us. For each calendar year during the term of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, no participant may receive stock options,
	stock appreciation rights and other awards that relate to more than 25% of the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan as of April&nbsp;28, 2015, subject to adjustments as permitted in the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan,
	and the maximum aggregate amount of cash that may be paid to any one participant during any calendar year with respect to one or more awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation pursuant to Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code is
	$1.0&nbsp;million. Nevertheless, stock options, stock appreciation rights and bonus awards may be made in excess of the limits described in the preceding sentence so long as such awards are not intended to qualify as performance-based compensation
	and are therefore not intended to be exempt from the deduction limit imposed by Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Stock Options
</I>
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
	exercise price of stock options granted under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan must not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date, subject to two exceptions, as set forth in the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. The
	term of a stock option may not exceed ten years. If a stock option or stock appreciation right is granted to an employee who is a non-exempt employee for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, the stock option or stock
	appreciation right, as applicable, will not be first exercisable for any shares of our common stock until at least six months following its grant date (although the award may vest prior to such date). An incentive stock option, or ISO, is a stock
	option granted to qualify for tax treatment applicable to ISOs under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code. A nonqualified stock option, or Non-ISO, is a stock option that is not subject to statutory requirements and limitations required for certain tax

	extraordinary capital distributions that we pay with respect to our shares of common stock during the period between the stock option&#146;s grant date and its exercise date. The compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, set forth in an
	award agreement that the participant may exercise unvested Non-ISOs, in which case the participant will receive shares of restricted common stock having the same vesting schedule that applied to the unvested stock options. The methods of payment of
	the exercise price of a stock option may include, among other things, cash, promissory note, other shares (subject to certain conditions), &#147;net exercise&#148;, cashless exercise, as well as other forms of legal consideration that may be

	Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)

	.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock appreciation rights, or SARs, allow the recipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market

	Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
</I>
	.&nbsp;&nbsp;Restricted share awards are grants of shares of our common stock that vest in
	accordance with terms and conditions established by the compensation committee and as set forth in the applicable award agreement. Restricted stock units, or RSUs, give recipients the right to acquire a specified number of shares of our common stock
	at a future date upon the satisfaction of certain vesting criteria established by the compensation committee and as set forth in an RSU award agreement. Unlike restricted shares, the shares underlying RSUs will not be issued until the RSUs have
	vested and are settled. The compensation committee may impose restrictions in the award agreement granting restricted shares or RSUs, including but not limited to restrictions concerning voting rights, transferability and receipt of dividends, which
	restrictions will lapse pursuant to circumstances or based upon criteria selected by the compensation committee, such as the participant&#146;s duration of continuous service, individual, group or divisional performance criteria, company performance
	or other criteria selected by the compensation committee. Restricted shares and RSUs may be awarded for such consideration as the compensation committee may determine, including without limitation cash, past or future services or any other form of
	legal consideration that may be acceptable to the compensation committee and permissible under applicable law. Except as set forth in the applicable award agreement or as determined by the compensation committee, upon termination of a
	participant&#146;s service for any reason, the participant will forfeit the restricted shares and RSUs to the extent the participant&#146;s interest therein has not vested

	Performance and Cash-Settled

	.&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance awards, including performance units, may be granted under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. The compensation committee may (but is not required to) designate a
<I>
</I>
	performance award as a &#147;performance
	compensation award&#148; that is intended to be exempt from limitations under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. A participant is eligible to receive payment in respect of a performance compensation award only if the performance goals for such award
	are achieved and the performance formula as
<I>
</I>
	applied against such performance goals determines that all or some portion of such participant&#146;s award has been
<I>
</I>
	earned for the performance period. The compensation committee will decide
	the length of a certain performance period, but such period may not be less than one fiscal year. The compensation committee is required under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan to specify in writing the performance period to which the performance
	compensation award relates, one or more goals for the performance period and an objective formula by which to measure
<I>
</I>
	whether or the extent to which the award is earned on the basis of the level of performance achieved with respect to one or
	more performance measures. Such criteria must be specified in writing no later than the earlier of the date that is 90&nbsp;days after the commencement of the performance period and the date on which 25% of the performance period elapses. Once
	established for a performance period, the performance goals and performance formula applicable to the award may not be amended or modified in a manner that would cause the compensation payable under the award to fail to constitute qualified
	performance-based compensation under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code; however, the compensation committee may exercise negative discretion to reduce or eliminate the amount of the performance compensation award if, in its sole discretion, such
	reduction or elimination is appropriate. The maximum performance compensation award that any one participant may receive for any one performance period will not exceed 381,942 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustments as permitted in the
	2014 Equity Incentive Plan, or, for performance units to be settled in cash, the greater of $1.0&nbsp;million or the fair market value of such number of shares of common stock on the grant date.

	equivalent rights will be paid out on the record date for the underlying dividends if the award occurs on a stand-alone basis, and on the vesting or later settlement date for an award if the dividend equivalent rights are granted as part of it.
	Dividend equivalent rights are settled in shares with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, unless the applicable award agreement provides for settlement in cash of all or part of the dividend equivalent right.

	which such person has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest, will also be deemed to be a related person. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee, consultant or director are not considered

	more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions, in

	further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The

	warrant made pursuant to a bona fide reasonable adjustment formula that has the effect of preventing dilution of the interest of the holders of the warrants should generally not result in a constructive distribution. See the more detailed discussion

	Over-allotment transactions involve sales by the underwriters of shares and warrants in excess of the number of shares and warrants the underwriters are obligated to purchase. This creates a syndicate short position

	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of shares in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to close out the
	short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared with the price at which they may purchase shares through exercise of the over-allotment option. If the
	underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by exercise of the over-allotment option and, therefore, have a naked short position, the position can be closed out only by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely
	to be created if the underwriters are concerned that after pricing there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

	MaloneBailey on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of MaloneBailey, would have caused MaloneBailey to make reference to the
	matter in any report they would have issued; and (2)&nbsp;there were no &#147;reportable events&#148; as that term is described in Item&nbsp;304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and
	the related statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
	these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
	(United States).&nbsp;Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.&nbsp;The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
	to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
	the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.&nbsp;An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
	amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.&nbsp;We believe that our audits provide a
	reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
	position of Viking Therapeutics, Inc., as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial
	statements, the Company has had recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations that raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#146;s plans regarding these matters also are
	described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	value judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in other income (expense). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as

	depository institutions in which those deposits are held. Additionally, the Company has established guidelines regarding approved investments and maturities of investments, which are designed to maintain safety and liquidity.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May&nbsp;2015, the Company completed an initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;), issuing 3,450,000 shares of its common stock and raising net proceeds of
	$22,326,366, including the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of $5,273,634. (See Note 7 regarding proceeds from the Company&#146;s initial public offering

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although it is difficult to predict the Company&#146;s liquidity requirements, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based upon the
	Company&#146;s current operating plan, the Company does not believe that it will have sufficient cash to meet its projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months unless it raises additional capital. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the
	Company had an accumulated deficit of $45,545,445. These losses have resulted principally from research and development costs incurred in connection with acquiring the exclusive worldwide rights to the portfolio of five drug candidates from Ligand
	Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (&#147;Ligand&#148;) and the related non-cash interest expense recorded for increases in the deemed fair market value for the license fees payable to Ligand, research and development expenses related to the manufacturing
	of clinical drug product and clinical development of VK5211, VK2809 and VK0214, consulting fees and general and administrative expenses. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as it continues the
	development of its clinical drug candidates and preclinical programs and incurs additional costs associated with being a public company.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Deferred financing costs represent legal, accounting and other direct costs related to the Company&#146;s efforts to raise capital

	The Company generally uses the

	stock units to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model. For options with a graded vesting schedule, the Company uses the graded vesting schedule to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods. The Black-Scholes
	model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including volatility, the expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. Stock options granted to non-employees are accounted for using
	the fair value approach. Stock options granted to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. For restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, the Company generally uses the straight-line or graded vesting
	method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over the holder&#146;s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, and uses the fair value at grant date to value the awards. For restricted stock that vests upon the
	satisfaction of certain performance conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. At the point that it becomes probable that the performance conditions will
	be met, the Company will record a cumulative catchup of the expense from the grant date to the current date, and the Company will then amortize the remainder of the expense over the remaining service period.

	Prior to the IPO, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all stock-based payments made to
	employees and directors based on estimated award date fair values, which estimates were highly complex and subjective in nature. The Company used the straight-line or graded vesting method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each
	restricted award&#146;s requisite service period, which was generally the vesting period, and estimated the fair value of restricted stock-based awards to employees and consultants using a Monte Carlo market approach simulation method and performed
	an allocation of value to common stock based on the estimated time to a liquidity event. In addition, the Company accounted for performance-based restricted stock awards to employees by determining the fair value of the restricted stock award at the
	date of issuance by using the Probability Weighted Expected Return Method (&#147;PWERM&#148;) and then assessing at each balance sheet date the probability of the performance criteria being met. If the probability of achieving the criteria was
	deemed less-than-probable, then no expense was recorded. At the point where the criteria were deemed probable of being met, then the Company began recording stock-based compensation with a cumulative catch-up expense in the period first recognized
	and then on a straight-line basis over the remaining period for which the performance criteria were expected to be completed.

	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
	Standards Update No.&nbsp;2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#147;ASU 2014-9&#148;), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The core principle of ASU 2014-9 is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised
	goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance initially was effective for the Company beginning January&nbsp;1, 2017,
	but on July 9, 2015 the FASB deferred the effective date and, as a result, the new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January&nbsp;1, 2018. Companies may adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date. The Company is
	currently evaluating the method of adoption and the potential impact this standard will have on its financial statements.

	issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (&#147;ASU 2015-17&#148;). To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in ASU 2015-17 require that
	deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
	The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements.

	Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included as a component of comprehensive loss. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, there were 14 securities in an unrealized loss position. These unrealized losses
	were less than $2,000 individually and $8,000 in the aggregate. These securities have not been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12&nbsp;months. The Company does not intend to sell these investments and it is not more likely
	than not that the Company will be required to sell these investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis which may be at maturity. The Company reviews its investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible
	other-than-temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of
	the investee, and the Company&#146;s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

	as it represents a conditional obligation that the Company must settle by issuing a variable number of shares of its common stock. The Company measured, at each reporting date until settled, the
	estimated amount of cash that would be paid if settlement occurred on the reporting date, with any changes in that fair market value reported as other expense during the period of change. In accordance with this guidance, the Company determined its
	enterprise values as of May&nbsp;21, 2014, the date the Master License Agreement was entered into, December&nbsp;31, 2014, its most recent fiscal year end, and as of May&nbsp;4, 2015, the closing date of the Company&#146;s IPO.

	The fair value of the assets was determined using a PWERM, which incorporated relevant events and expected exit scenarios for the Company. The exit scenarios
	included an initial public offering, a merger or acquisition, which included an assumption of a Private Financing, and a scenario in which neither an initial public offering nor the merger or acquisition occurred. The enterprise value was based
	primarily on the market approach and probability-weighted expected exit values for the Company under each scenario. As of the execution of the Master License Agreement, the Company ascribed a percentage likelihood to each expected exit scenario, and
	each was less than 50%. However, since Ligand was entitled to receive shares under the Master License Agreement if either of these IPO or merger or acquisition scenarios were to occur, and the sum of the percentage likelihoods for the two exceeded
	50%, the Company determined that a payout of shares was probable. Further, since the valuations would determine a value, the Company determined that the liability under the Master License Agreement should be reported as of the execution of the
	Master License Agreement. Similar publicly traded companies and merger or acquisition transactions were utilized as part of the market approach, and appropriate metrics were applied to the Company&#146;s numbers along with qualitative comparable
	assessments. The Company utilized a Monte Carlo simulation method to determine the weighted average per share value as of the acquisition date and in accordance with the Master License Agreement, utilized that per share value to calculate the
	estimated license fee liability as of May&nbsp;21, 2014 to be $21,169,616. In addition, the Company incurred an incremental charge of $517,960 on September&nbsp;6, 2014 related to the license fee liability pursuant to the amendment to the Master
	License Agreement.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Having determined the amount of the liability to be reported, the Company then evaluated whether to report the offset as an asset or
	as an expense. In accordance with ASC Topic 730
<I>
	, Research and Development
</I>
	, intangible assets that are acquired and have an alternative future use, as defined, should be capitalized and reported as an intangible asset; however, the cost of
	acquired intangible assets that do not have alternative future uses should be reported as research and development expense as incurred. The Company noted that the assets, the rights for which were acquired pursuant to the Master License Agreement,
	are in the preclinical and clinical stages, and not FDA approved. The Company has therefore interpreted the guidance to say that since these assets are not commercially readily saleable, i.e., they are still in preclinical and clinical trials, that
	they do not satisfy the definition of having an alternative future use, as defined. Accordingly, the Company recorded the offset to the license fee liability as research and development expense in May&nbsp;2014.

	The Company revalued the license fee liability as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 using consistent methodology to that used for the May valuation; however, given
	the Company&#146;s recent refocus to certain other programs as well as some deemed market risks as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, it revalued the license fee liability based upon these new programs; VK5211 to be used in hip fractures and VK0214 to be

	. At issuance, the fair value of the debt conversion feature totaled $8,286 on the Notes issued during 2012 and $42,747 on the Notes issued during 2013. The fair value of the debt
	conversion feature was allocated from the gross proceeds of the Notes with the respective discount amortized to interest expense over the original term of the Notes using the effective interest method. The valuation of the bifurcated debt conversion

	In connection with the preparation of the financial statements necessary for inclusion in a registration statement, in May&nbsp;2014 the Company

	To appropriately account for this stock

	was based primarily on the market approach and probability-weighted expected exit values for the Company under each scenario. Similar merger and acquisition transactions and publicly traded companies were utilized within the market approach and
	appropriate metrics were applied to the Company along with qualitative comparable assessments. The indicated value under the market approach was used as the starting aggregate value for the valuation of these performance-based shares. The Company
	utilized a Monte Carlo simulation method to determine the fair value of the performance-based shares as of the issuance date. The Monte Carlo simulation method takes into consideration the expected timing of the performance milestones, probability

	The Company generally uses the straight-line or graded vesting method to allocate compensation cost to reporting
	periods over each optionee&#146;s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, and estimates the fair value of stock-based awards or restricted stock units to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-valuation
	model. For options with a graded vesting schedule, the Company uses the graded vesting schedule to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including volatility, the
	expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. Stock options granted to non-employees are accounted for using the fair value approach. Stock options granted to non-employees are subject to
	periodic revaluation over their vesting terms.

	2014 Plan.
</I>
	The 2014 Plan provides that the compensation committee of the Company&#146;s Board of
	Directors (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;) may grant or issue stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and unrestricted shares, deferred share units, performance and cash-settled awards and dividend
	equivalent rights to participants under the 2014 Plan. Initially, a total of 1,527,770 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2014 Plan, which number is also the limit on shares of common stock available
	for awards of incentive stock options. The number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan will, unless otherwise determined by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, be automatically increased on
	January&nbsp;1st of each year commencing on January&nbsp;1, 2016 and ending on (and including) January&nbsp;1, 2024, in an amount equal to 3.5% of the total number of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31st of the
	preceding calendar year. The shares of common stock deliverable pursuant to awards under the 2014 Plan are authorized but unissued shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, or shares of the Company&#146;s common stock that the Company otherwise
	holds in treasury or in trust. Any shares of the Company&#146;s common stock underlying awards that are settled in cash or otherwise expire, or are forfeited, terminated or cancelled (including pursuant to an exchange program established by the
	Compensation Committee) prior to the issuance of stock will again be available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. In addition, shares of the Company&#146;s common stock that are withheld (or not issued) in payment of the exercise price or taxes
	relating to an award, and shares of the Company&#146;s common stock equal to the number surrendered in payment of any exercise price or withholding taxes relating to an award, will again be available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.

	ESPP.
</I>
	Initially, a total of 458,331 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the ESPP. The number of shares
	available for issuance under the ESPP will, unless otherwise determined by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, be automatically increased on January&nbsp;1st of each year commencing on January&nbsp;1, 2016 and ending
	on (and including) January&nbsp;1, 2024, in an amount equal to 1% of the total number of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31st of the preceding calendar year. The shares of common stock available for purchase
	pursuant to the ESPP are authorized but unissued shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, shares of the Company&#146;s common stock that the Company otherwise holds in treasury or shares of the Company&#146;s common stock that were purchased on
	the open market in arms&#146; length transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. Shares of the Company&#146;s common stock will be offered for purchase under the ESPP as determined by the Compensation Committee through a series of
	successive offerings that each have a term of 24&nbsp;months and consist of four consecutive purchase periods of six months each. Prior to the commencement of any future offering under the ESPP, the Compensation Committee may determine that the
	current offering shall end, may commence a new offering on the first day after the end of such terminal purchase period (or any desired later date), and may decide that future offerings will consist of one or more consecutive purchase periods, each
	to be of such duration as determined by the Compensation Committee; however, no offering will exceed 27&nbsp;months and no purchase period will exceed one year. Each employee of the Company who (1)&nbsp;is an employee on the first date of any
	offering under the ESPP, (2)&nbsp;is customarily scheduled to work for more than 20 hours per week and more than five months per calendar year, and (3)&nbsp;meets such other criteria as may be determined by the Compensation Committee (consistent
	with Section&nbsp;423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), is eligible to participate in the ESPP for each purchase period within such offering. The purchase price per share of the Company&#146;s common stock under the ESPP may not be
	less than, and will initially be equal to, the lesser of: (1)&nbsp;85% of the fair market value per share of the Company&#146;s common stock on the first day of the offering, or (2)&nbsp;85% of the fair market value per share of the Company&#146;s
	common stock on the date the purchase right is exercised, which will be the last day of the applicable purchase period.

	A valuation allowance of $8,403,620 and $17,722,531 at December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2015, respectively, has
	been recorded to offset net deferred tax assets, as the Company is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5,890,000 and $6,629,000, respectively. The
	federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2032. The Company&#146;s ability to utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
	amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of an &#147;ownership change,&#148; which is defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code as a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 50% within a
	three-year period. If the Company undergoes one or more ownership changes in connection with any future transactions in its stock, the Company&#146;s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal taxable income, if any, could
	potentially result in increased future tax liability to the Company. An ownership change under Section&nbsp;382 of the Code occurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 in connection with the Company&#146;s initial public offering. A
	portion of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation.

	The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income
	tax in various state jurisdictions. The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and various state agencies for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 through December&nbsp;31, 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The differences between the Company&#146;s effective income tax rate and the statutory federal rate for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 relate primarily to losses incurred for which no tax benefit was recognized, due to the uncertainty of realization. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
	income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. At each of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31,
	2015, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of those assets as a result of historical taxable net losses.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company has reviewed its operations and has not identified any material uncertain tax positions. As a result, there is no liability for uncertain tax
	positions in the income tax provision as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 or December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	transaction occurring subsequent to January&nbsp;22, 2016, but prior to the Maturity Date, with aggregate net proceeds to the Company of at least $2.0 million (the &#147;Next Financing&#148;), the Company will be required to repay $1.5 million of

	The Amended Loan Agreement also provides that, on or after the Maturity

	cash. However, if the Company does not elect to repay the Remaining Balance solely in cash, Ligand can set the form of payment as cash, shares of the Company&#146;s common stock or both. To the extent that any portion of the Remaining Balance will
	be paid in shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, the number of shares issuable will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the portion of the Remaining Balance that will be paid in shares by the lesser of (a)&nbsp;the volume weighted
	average closing price of the Company&#146;s common stock for the 30 days prior to the date of Ligand&#146;s demand for repayment or the date of the Company&#146;s prepayment of the Remaining Balance in full, as applicable, and (b)&nbsp;$8.00

	On January&nbsp;22, 2016, the Company also entered into a

	The Registrant has indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers that may be broader than the specific indemnification
	provisions contained in the DGCL. These indemnification agreements require the Registrant, among other things, to indemnify its directors and executive officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service. These
	indemnification agreements also require the Registrant to advance all expenses incurred by the directors and executive officers in investigating or defending any such action, suit or proceeding, subject to certain exceptions. The Registrant believes

	The limitation of liability

	executive officers even though an action, if successful, might benefit the Registrant and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder&#146;s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that the Registrant pays the costs of settlement and
	damage awards against directors and executive officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, the Registrant is not aware of any pending litigation or proceeding involving any person who is or was one of its directors,
	officers, employees or other agents or is or was serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for which indemnification is sought, and the Registrant
