	Saban Capital Acquisition Corp. is a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of
	effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf,

	This is an initial public offering of our securities.
	Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject
	to adjustment as described in this prospectus, and only whole warrants are exercisable. We have also granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of this prospectus to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000 units to cover over-allotments,
	if any.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:2PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon the completion of our

	the public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, subject to applicable law and as further described herein.

	Our sponsor, Saban Sponsor LLC, has
	committed to purchase an aggregate of 6,000,000 warrants (or 6,600,000 warrants if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($6,000,000 in the aggregate or $6,600,000 if the
	underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at

	shares will automatically convert into Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein. Holders of the Class F ordinary shares and holders of the
	Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote to our shareholders, except as required by law.

	units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus unless Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. inform us of their decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to certain conditions
	described in this prospectus. Once the securities constituting the units begin separate trading, we expect that the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbols &#147;SCAC&#148; and &#147;SCACW&#148;

	Haim Saban, our Chairman nominee, is an entrepreneur and leader in the entertainment industry,
	with over forty years of experience as an operator and investor in media companies globally. Mr.&nbsp;Saban got his start by building a successful tour promotion business in Israel and later an independent record company in France. Upon moving to
	Los Angeles in 1983, he launched a chain of recording studios that became a top supplier of music for television. In 1988, Mr.&nbsp;Saban formed Saban Entertainment, an international television, production, distribution and merchandising company,
	which produced several major hits including X-Men and other shows around Marvel characters. In addition, Saban Entertainment introduced to the United States the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, a global phenomenon that to this day is one of the top
	selling boys&#146; toy brands in the United States.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 1995, Mr.&nbsp;Saban merged Saban Entertainment with News Corporation&#146;s Fox
	Kids Network, creating an integrated entertainment company that combined Saban Entertainment&#146;s content and merchandising strength with Fox Broadcasting&#146;s network distribution. In 1997, the Saban-Fox partnership acquired the Fox Family
	Channel, a fully distributed cable network. This partnership was restructured under the Fox Family Worldwide banner, which included the Fox Family Channel, the Fox Kids Network, Saban Entertainment, and Fox Kids International, a publicly traded,
	European based company with networks reaching dozens of countries in Europe and the Middle East. Mr.&nbsp;Saban and News Corporation sold Fox Family Worldwide to The Walt Disney Company in 2001. Shortly thereafter, Mr.&nbsp;Saban formed Saban
	Capital, where he serves as Chairman of its Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. In 2003, Saban Capital led a group of private equity investors that acquired a controlling stake in ProSiebenSat.1 Media, Germany&#146;s largest broadcasting
	group at the time. Mr.&nbsp;Saban served as ProSiebenSat.1&#146;s Chairman of the Supervisory Board from 2003 until the sale of the group&#146;s stake in 2007 to private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Permira. In 2005, Saban Capital teamed
	with Apax Partners and Arkin Communications to acquire a controlling stake in Bezeq The Israeli Telecommunication Corp Ltd., as part of the Israeli government&#146;s privatization of the company. In 2007, Saban Capital teamed with a group of private
	equity investors to acquire Univision Communications Inc., the Spanish-language media company in the U.S., in a take private transaction. Mr.&nbsp;Saban has served as the Chairman of the Board of Univision since 2007. Mr.&nbsp;Saban has also
	previously served on the Board of Directors of DirecTV, Inc. and Television Francaise 1, the largest commercial broadcaster in France.

	Our management team&#146;s objective is to generate attractive returns and create value for our shareholders by applying our strategy of
	identifying operationally-oriented acquisition opportunities and capitalizing on the ability of our management team to acquire and manage a business that can benefit from our management team&#146;s established global relationships and industry
	experience. Our management team&#146;s approach is focused on industries or sectors in which we have considerable knowledge and emphasizes downside protection and the preservation of capital by opportunistically pursuing transactions where we
	believe we have the ability to capture asymmetric risk/reward potential. Our management team has successfully applied this approach over the past decade across North America, Europe, Asia and Israel and has deployed capital successfully in all
	market cycles, established global relationships and developed industry experience.

	Permitted purchases of public shares by our affiliates
</P>
</TD>
<TD>
	If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of
	their affiliates may purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no
	current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares in such transactions. If
	they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
	Subsequent to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material
	non-public information; and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors,
	including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.

	underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us,
	pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Our

	reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below: (i) $10.00 per public share; or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the

	We are a recently incorporated company that has conducted no operations and has generated no revenues. Until we complete our initial business
	combination, we will have no operations and will generate no operating revenues. In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the background of our management team, but also the special risks we
	face as a blank check company. This offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check
	offerings. For additional information concerning how Rule 419 blank check offerings differ from this offering, please see the section of this prospectus entitled &#147;Proposed Business&#151;Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check
	Companies Subject to Rule 419.&#148; You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section of this prospectus entitled &#147;Risk Factors.&#148;

	founder shares, as well as any public shares purchased during or after this offering, in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders&#146; founder shares, we would need 7,500,001, or 37.5%, of the
	20,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised) in order to have such initial business combination approved. Our other
	directors and officers have entered into letter agreements similar to the one signed by our initial shareholders with respect to public shares acquired by them (if any) following this offering. Our initial shareholders will own at least 20% of our
	outstanding ordinary shares immediately following the completion of this offering. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more likely that the necessary shareholder approval will be received than
	would be the case if our initial shareholders agreed to vote their founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public shareholders.

	At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business
	combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights and, therefore, will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our
	initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust
	account to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the
	cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our
	ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in
	connection with a business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the per-share value
	of shares held by non-redeeming shareholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions.

	acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources.
	This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, if we are obligated to pay cash for the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares redeemed, the resources available to us for

	future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business
	combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought

	amount of funds in the trust account to below: (i)&nbsp;$10.00 per public share; or (ii)&nbsp;such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the

	responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for its indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a
	result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to

	its permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the private placement warrants and the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants, and holders of warrants that may be issued upon
	conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register the resale of such warrants or the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and
	availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial
	business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the
	market price of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares that is expected when the ordinary shares owned by our initial shareholders and private placement warrants owned by our sponsor or holders of our working capital loans or their respective permitted

	We may seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in any industry or sector, but we will not, under our amended and
	restated memorandum and articles of association, be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet identified or approached any specific
	target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business&#146;s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects.
	To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an
	established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks
	inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be
	outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to
	investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the
	value of their securities. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other

	We are an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; within the meaning
	of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not
	being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the
	requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem
	important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any
	June&nbsp;30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these
	exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our
	securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.

	Further, Section&nbsp;102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts
	emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of
	securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
	that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application
	dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public
	company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.

	Our corporate affairs will be governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law (as the same may

	Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common
	law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what

	liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there
	is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the
	merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in
	the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds
	of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman

	country&#146;s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our
	ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.

	In the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar
	equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in
	political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial
	condition and results of operations. Additionally, because a substantial portion of many foreign companies&#146; revenues is generated in dollars and euros, while a significant portion of their expenses is incurred in its local currency, a target
	business&#146; revenue may also be reduced due to inflation in such country and currency exchange rate fluctuations.

	These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
	estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations,
	we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
	diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of
	expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately $40,000 to be available to us from
	interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over the 12 months following the closing of this offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02%&nbsp;per annum based upon
	current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our
	officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such
	loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
	proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The
	warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
	agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan
	such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

	The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate
	declaring any share dividends in the foreseeable future, except if we increase the size of this offering, in which case we will effect a capitalization or share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism immediately prior to the
	consummation of this offering in an amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial shareholders prior to this offering at 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon the consummation of this offering. Further, if we incur any
	indebtedness in connection with a business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

	The difference between the public offering price per Class&nbsp;A ordinary share, assuming no value is attributed to the warrants included in
	the units we are offering pursuant to this prospectus or the private placement warrants, and the pro forma net tangible book value per Class&nbsp;A ordinary share after this offering constitutes the dilution to investors in this offering. Such
	calculation does not reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of warrants, including the private placement warrants, which would cause the actual dilution to the public shareholders to be higher, particularly where a cashless
	exercise is utilized. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities (including the value of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares which may be redeemed for
	cash), by the number of outstanding Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares.

	At July 31, 2016, our net tangible book value was $(53,090), or
	approximately ($0.009) per Class F ordinary share. After giving effect to the sale of 20,000,000 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares included in the units we are offering by this prospectus, the sale of the private placement warrants and the deduction of
	underwriting commissions and estimated expenses of this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value at July 31, 2016 would have been $5,000,004 or $0.82 per share, representing an immediate increase in net tangible book value to our initial
	shareholders of $0.829 per share, assuming no value is attributed to the warrants included in the units or the private placement warrants, as of the date of this prospectus. Total dilution to public shareholders from this offering will be $9.18 per
	share. The dilution to new investors if the underwriters exercise the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option in full would be an immediate dilution of $9.28 per share or 92.8%.

	Our liquidity needs have been satisfied prior to the completion of this offering through receipt of $25,000 from our sale of the founder shares
	and $150,000 in loans from our sponsor. As of July 31, 2016, we had borrowed $150,000 under the unsecured promissory note. We estimate that the net proceeds from: (i)&nbsp;the sale of the units in this offering, after deducting offering expenses of
	approximately $850,000 and underwriting commissions of $4,000,000 ($4,600,000 if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full) (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of $7,000,000 (or up to $8,050,000 if the
	underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full)); and (ii)&nbsp;the sale of the private placement warrants for a purchase price of $6,000,000 (or $6,600,000 if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full), will
	be $201.15 million (or $231.15 million if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of this amount, $200.0 million (or $230.0 million if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full), which includes
	$7,000,000 (or up to $8,050,000 if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be deposited into a trust account. The funds in the trust account will be invested only in specified
	U.S. government treasury bills or in specified money market funds. The remaining $1,150,000 will not be held in the trust account. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $850,000, we may fund such excess with funds not to be
	held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $850,000, the

	trust account will be sufficient to pay our taxes. To the extent that our ordinary shares or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be
	used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

	In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended

	repayment. Up to $1,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued

	respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used
	as a down payment or to fund a &#147;no-shop&#148; provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our

	On April&nbsp;5,
	2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; and under the JOBS Act
	will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may
	not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with
	new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the
	benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an &#147;emerging growth company&#148;, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be
	required to, among other things: (i)&nbsp;provide an auditor&#146;s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section&nbsp;404; (ii)&nbsp;provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be
	required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (iii)&nbsp;comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to
	the auditor&#146;s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (iv)&nbsp;disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive
	compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO&#146;s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an
	&#147;emerging growth company,&#148; whichever is earlier.

	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in
	connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other
	person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a &#147;group&#148; (as defined under Section&nbsp;13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares. We believe this restriction
	will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or
	its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering
	could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&#146;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders&#146; ability to redeem
	no more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a
	business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders&#146; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess
	Shares) for or against our initial business combination.

	We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in
	&#147;street name,&#148; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to
	approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company&#146;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#146;s
	option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery
	requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy
	materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.

	There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them
	through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or
	not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

	indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As
	a result, the shareholder then had an &#147;option window&#148; after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&#146;s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price,
	he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder
	meeting, would become &#147;option&#148; rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a

	In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from
	other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are
	well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability
	to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with
	our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably
	by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

	circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be
	unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential
	acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

	shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our

	merger, share exchange, reorganization, or other similar transaction after our initial business combination that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like)

	must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation containing certain prescribed information. That plan for merger or consolidation must then be authorized by either (a)&nbsp;a special resolution of the shareholders of each company (usually at
	least a majority of 66 2/3% in value of those who attend and vote at a general meeting); or (b)&nbsp;such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company&#146;s articles of association. A shareholder has the right to
	vote on a merger or consolidation regardless of whether the shares that he holds otherwise give him voting rights. No shareholder resolution is required for a merger between a parent company (i.e., a company that owns at least 90% of the issued
	shares of each class in a subsidiary company) and its subsidiary company. The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest of a constituent company must be obtained, unless the court waives such requirement. If the Cayman Islands
	Registrar of Companies is satisfied that the requirements of the Companies Law (which includes certain other formalities) have been complied with, the Registrar of Companies will register the plan of merger or consolidation.

	similar arrangement has been entered into or made in any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company are and continue to be suspended or restricted.

	expiration of the period set out in paragraph (b)&nbsp;above or seven days following the date on which the plan of merger or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the constituent company, the surviving company or the consolidated company must
	make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the fair value and if the company and the shareholder agree the price within 30 days following the date on which the offer was made,
	the company must pay the shareholder such amount; (e)&nbsp;if the company and the shareholder fail to agree a price within such 30 day period, within 20 days following the date on which such 30 day period expires, the company (and any dissenting
	shareholder) must file a petition with the Cayman Islands Grand Court to determine the fair value and such petition must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the dissenting shareholders with whom agreements as to the fair value of
	their shares have not been reached by the company. At the hearing of that petition, the court has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid by the company upon the amount determined
	to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list filed by the company may participate fully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of a dissenting shareholder are not be
	available in certain circumstances, for example, to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect of which an open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where the
	consideration for such shares to be contributed are shares of any company listed on a national securities exchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated company.

	Moreover, Cayman Islands law also has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain
	circumstances, schemes of arrangement will generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies, commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as a &#147;scheme of arrangement&#148; which may be tantamount

	United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The following discussion summarizes U.S. federal income tax considerations associated with an investment in our units (consisting of
	Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants) that are purchased in this offering by U.S. Holders (defined below). Because the components of a unit are generally separable at the option of the holder, the holder of a unit generally should be treated,
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the owner of the ordinary share and warrant components of the unit. As a result, the discussion below of the U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and
	warrants that have been separated should also apply to holders of units (as the owners of the underlying Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants that constitute the units).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This discussion is limited to U.S. federal income tax considerations to beneficial owners of our securities who are initial purchasers of a
	unit pursuant to this offering and hold the unit and each component of the unit as a capital asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion assumes that the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants will trade separately and that any
	distributions made (or deemed made) by us on our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and any consideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition of our securities will be in U.S. dollars. This
	discussion is a summary for general information only and does not consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to the investment in a unit by a prospective investor based on its particular circumstances.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Moreover, the discussion below is based upon current U.S. federal income tax law, which is subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis,
	which may affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. Furthermore, this discussion does not address any aspect of U.S. federal non-income tax laws, such as gift or estate tax laws, or state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

	We have not sought, and will not seek, a ruling from the IRS as to any U.S. federal income tax consequence described herein. The IRS may
	disagree with the discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover, there can be no assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not
	adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this discussion.

	As used herein, the term &#147;U.S. Holder&#148; means a beneficial
	owner of our securities that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i)&nbsp;an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii)&nbsp;a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is
	created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii)&nbsp;an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
	source, or (iv)&nbsp;a trust if (A)&nbsp;a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust,

	This discussion does not consider the tax treatment of

	U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our securities, we urge you to consult your tax

	General Treatment of Units
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	No statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes and, therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. The acquisition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and one-half of one
	warrant (one warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one share of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares). We intend to treat the acquisition of a unit in this manner and, by purchasing a unit, you will agree to adopt such treatment for tax
	purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and the one-half of one warrant based on the relative fair market
	value of each at the time of issuance. The price allocated to each Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant should be the shareholder&#146;s tax basis in such share or one-half of one warrant. Any disposition of a unit should be
	treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant constituting the unit, and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the Class&nbsp;A ordinary
	share and one-half of one warrant based on their relative fair market values at the time of disposition. The separation of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant constituting a unit should not be a taxable event for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The foregoing treatment of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and warrants and a holder&#146;s purchase price
	allocation are not binding on the IRS or the courts. Because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the characterization
	described above or the discussion below. Accordingly, each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and any foreign tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative
	characterizations of a unit). The balance of this discussion assumes that the characterization of the units described above is respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

	Subject

	our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to the extent the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Distributions in excess of such earnings and profits generally
	will be applied against and reduce the U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in its Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares (but not below zero) and, to the extent in excess of such tax basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or other disposition of such
	Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares (taxed as described below under &#147;&#151;Gain or Loss on Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares and Warrants&#148;).

	Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, if a U.S. Holder&#146;s Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares are redeemed pursuant to the redemption
	provisions described in this prospectus under &#147;Description of Securities&#151;Ordinary Shares&#148; or if we purchase a U.S. Holder&#146;s Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares in an open market transaction, the U.S. federal income tax consequences will
	depend on whether the redemption qualifies as sale of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares under Section&nbsp;302 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). If the redemption or purchase by us qualifies as a sale of
	Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder will be treated as described above under &#147;&#151;Gain or Loss on Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares and Warrants.&#148; If the redemption or purchase by us does not
	qualify as a sale of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a distribution with respect to the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, taxed as described above under &#147;&#151;Taxation of Distributions.&#148; Whether a
	redemption or purchase by us qualifies for sale treatment will depend primarily on the total number of our shares treated as held by the U.S. Holder (including any shares constructively owned by the U.S. Holder as a result of owning warrants) before
	and after such redemption or purchase. A redemption or purchase by us of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares generally will be treated as a sale of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares (rather than as a distribution) if such redemption or purchase (i)&nbsp;is
	&#147;substantially disproportionate&#148; with respect to the U.S. Holder, (ii)&nbsp;results in a &#147;complete termination&#148; of the U.S. Holder&#146;s interest in us or (iii)&nbsp;is &#147;not essentially equivalent to a dividend&#148; with
	respect to the U.S. Holder.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The redemption of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares generally will be &#147;substantially
	disproportionate&#148; with respect to a U.S. Holder if the percentage of our outstanding voting shares that the U.S. Holder actually and constructively owns immediately after the redemption is less than 80 percent of the percentage of our
	outstanding voting shares that the U.S. Holder actually and constructively owned immediately before the redemption. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder&#146;s interest if either (i)&nbsp;all of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares
	actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed or (ii)&nbsp;all of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares actually owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed and the U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with
	specific rules, the attribution of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares owned by certain family members and the U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. The redemption of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will not be
	essentially equivalent to a dividend if it results in a &#147;meaningful reduction&#148; of the U.S. Holder&#146;s proportionate interest in us. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. Holder&#146;s proportionate
	interest will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. The IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority shareholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no
	control over corporate affairs may constitute such a &#147;meaningful reduction.&#148;

	In applying the above tests, a U.S. Holder takes

	The tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current law. A cashless exercise may not be
	taxable, either because the exercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In either situation, a U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares
	received generally will equal the U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in the warrant. If the cashless exercise was not a realization event, it is unclear whether a U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period for the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares will commence on the

	It is also possible that a cashless exercise may be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In
	such event, a U.S. Holder may be deemed to have surrendered warrants with an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price of the total number of warrants to be exercised. The U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount
	equal to the difference between (i)&nbsp;the fair market value of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares deemed received represented by the warrants deemed surrendered and (ii)&nbsp;the sum of the U.S. Holder&#146;s initial investment in, and the exercise
	price of, such warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares received would equal the sum of the U.S. Holder&#146;s initial investment in the warrants exercised (i.e., the portion of the U.S.
	Holder&#146;s purchase price for a unit that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under &#147;&#151;General Treatment of Units&#148;) and the exercise price of such warrants. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period for

	The terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares for which the warrant may be exercised or to
	the exercise price of the warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this prospectus captioned &#147;Description of Securities&#151;Warrants&#151;Public Shareholders&#146; Warrants.&#148; An adjustment which has the effect of
	preventing dilution generally is not taxable. The U.S. Holders of the warrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases the warrant holders&#146; proportionate interest in
	our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise) as a result of a distribution of cash to the holders of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. Such
	constructive distribution would be treated as if the U.S. Holders of the warrants received a cash distribution from us generally equal to the fair market value of such increased interest (taxed as described above under &#147;&#151;Taxation of
	Distributions&#148;). For certain information reporting purposes, we are required to determine the date and amount of any such constructive distributions. Recently proposed Treasury regulations, on which we may rely prior to the issuance of final

	A foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (i)&nbsp;at least 75% of its
	gross income in a taxable year, including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is passive income or (ii)&nbsp;at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year
	(ordinarily determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year) are held for the production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or

	Because we are a
	blank check company, with no current active business, we believe that it is likely that we will meet the PFIC asset or income test for our taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016. Pursuant to a start-up exception, a corporation will not be a PFIC
	for the first taxable year the corporation has gross income, if (1)&nbsp;no predecessor of the corporation was a PFIC; (2)&nbsp;the corporation satisfies the IRS that it will not be a PFIC for either of the first two taxable years following the
	start-up year; and (3)&nbsp;the corporation is not in fact a PFIC for either of those years. The applicability of the start-up exception to us will not be known until after the close of the taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016. After the
	acquisition of a company or assets in a business combination, we may still meet one of the PFIC tests depending on the timing of the acquisition and the amount of our passive income and assets, as well as the passive income and assets of the
	acquired business. If the company that we acquire in a business combination is a PFIC, then we will likely be a PFIC for the taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016. Our actual PFIC status for the current taxable year or any subsequent taxable
	year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Accordingly, there can be no assurance with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 or any future taxable year.

	to a U.S. Holder who held Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants while we were a PFIC, whether or not we meet the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years. If we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is

	U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants, and (ii)&nbsp;any &#147;excess distribution&#148; made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the

	Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our securities. Consequently, the
	initial public offering price for the units was determined by negotiations between us and the representatives. Among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were the history and prospects of companies whose principal

	traded companies considered comparable to our company. We cannot assure you, however, that the price at which the units, Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial
	public offering price or that an active trading market in our units, Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares or warrants will develop and continue after this offering.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Saban Capital Acquisition Corp. (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of July&nbsp;31, 2016, and the related
	statements of operations, changes in shareholder&#146;s deficit, and cash flows for the period from March&nbsp;15, 2016 (inception) through July&nbsp;31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our
	responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
	financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements
	referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Saban Capital Acquisition Corp., as of July&nbsp;31, 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from March&nbsp;15, 2016 (inception)
	through July&nbsp;31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles&nbsp;generally accepted in the United States of America.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The accompanying financial
	statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred a loss from operations and has a shareholder&#146;s deficit that raise substantial
	doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#146;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Saban Capital Acquisition Corp. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March&nbsp;15, 2016. The Company was formed
	for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the &#147;Business Combination&#148;). The Company is an &#147;emerging growth
	company,&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#147;JOBS Act&#148;).

	At July&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had not commenced any operations. On April 11, 2016, the Company&#146;s Founder Shares were funded (the
	&#147;Date of Funding&#148;) (Note 3). All activity for the period from March&nbsp;15, 2016 (inception) through July&nbsp;31, 2016 relates to the Company&#146;s formation and the proposed initial public offering (&#147;Proposed Offering&#148;). The
	Company will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of the Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds
	derived from the Proposed Offering. The Company has selected December&nbsp;31st as its fiscal year end.

	The Company, after signing a definitive agreement for a Business Combination, will either (i)&nbsp;seek shareholder approval
	of the Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose in connection with which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Business Combination, for cash equal to their pro rata share
	of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable, or (ii)&nbsp;provide shareholders with the opportunity to sell
	their shares to the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount in cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior
	to commencement of the tender offer, including interest but less taxes payable. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of the Business Combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares in a tender offer will
	be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require the Company to seek shareholder approval, unless a
	vote is required by NASDAQ rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval, it will complete its Business Combination only if a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. However, in
	no event will the Company redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In such case, the Company would not proceed with the redemption of its public shares and the related Business
	Combination, and instead may search for an alternate Business Combination.

	If the Company holds a shareholder vote or there is a tender

	business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest but less taxes payable. As a result, such ordinary shares will be recorded at their redemption amount and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of
	the Proposed Offering, in accordance with ASC 480, &#147;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&#148;

	Section&nbsp;102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting

	financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable.
	The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can
	adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard.

	Also on August 19, 2016, the Company adopted the Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to provide incentive to independent directors, employees and
	consultants to further the growth, development and financial success of the Company through the ownership of Company shares by them. The Plan provides that the Company may grant employees, consultants and/or independent directors Class F ordinary
	shares and may require the grantees to pay a price for such shares. The aggregate number of shares available for grant under the Plan is 150,000 Class F ordinary shares. Unless otherwise provided in an applicable award agreement, all Class F
	ordinary shares issued pursuant to the Plan are subject to repurchase by the Company, at the Company&#146;s option, at fair market value on the termination of employment, directorship or consultancy, as applicable, on or before the Company&#146;s
	initial business combination. If such termination was for cause, as such term is defined in the Plan, the holder resigns for any reason on or before the Company&#146;s initial business combination or the holder breaches restrictive covenants to
	which the holder is subject, the repurchase price paid by the Company will be the lesser of the cost and fair market value of such shares. In addition, the form of the award agreement used for the initial awards described below provides that in case
	of a termination for cause, all Class F ordinary shares granted to the grantee will be forfeited. Under the Plan, the Company&#146;s board of directors (or a committee or a subcommittee designated by the board of directors) shall administer and make
	all determinations with respect to the Plan, and it&#146;s the duty of the board of directors to conduct the general administration of the Plan. The Plan provides that the shares issued thereunder will be subject to certain transfer restrictions,
	including restrictions on transfers prior to the Company&#146;s initial business combination.

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company&#146;s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification
	of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences
	of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as
	such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We will enter into agreements with our officers and
	directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. We may purchase a policy of directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance
	that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These
	provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder&#146;s
	investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced
	officers and directors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors,
	officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

	In April 2016, Saban Sponsor LLC, our sponsor, purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 founder shares, for an aggregate offering price of $25,000
	at an average purchase price of approximately $0.004 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding ordinary shares upon completion of this
	offering. Such securities were issued in connection with our organization pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section&nbsp;4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Our sponsor is an accredited investor for purposes of Rule 501 of
	Regulation D. In August 2016, we repurchased 99,000 founder shares from our sponsor at their original per share issuance price and subsequently issued such number of founder shares for the same per share price to certain individuals who will assist
	in the evaluation of investment opportunities. Such securities were issued pursuant to The 2016 Share Award Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;), which is filed as Exhibit&nbsp;10.9 to this registration statement, to certain of our employees, directors and
	consultants, in reliance on the exemption provided by Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act, or pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act, relative to transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, to the extent an
	exemption from such registration was required. The purpose of the Plan is to provide incentive to our independent directors, employees and consultants to further our growth, development and financial success through the ownership of our shares by
	them.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, our sponsor has committed, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase from us an aggregate of 6,000,000 private
	placement warrants (or 6,600,000 warrants if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is exercised in full) at $1.00 per warrant (for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000,000 or $6,600,000 if the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option is
	exercised in full). This purchase will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering. This issuance will be made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in
	Section&nbsp;4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

	(b)&nbsp;Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and
	controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
	Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
	successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
	settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does
	not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to
	contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer,
