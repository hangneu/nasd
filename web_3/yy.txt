	Our business is primarily conducted in
	China and most of our revenues are denominated in RMB. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars and from
	U.S. dollars to RMB in this annual report were made at a rate of RMB6.4778 to US$1.00, the exchange rate on December&nbsp;31,
	2015 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release published by the Federal Reserve Board. We make no representation that any RMB
	or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S.&nbsp;dollars or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular
	rate or at all. The PRC government imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the

	typically provide for automatic extension or renewal. A few of our online games are licensed to us by third party game developers

	good relationships with our third party game developers to have access to new popular games with reasonable revenue-sharing or

	to increase user awareness of our products and services and to expand our user base. If we decide to engage in more conventional
	advertising or marketing campaigns, our sales and marketing expenses will increase, which could have an adverse effect on our results

	would materially and negatively affect our results of operations.

	We do not operate our platform on a real-name
	basis and therefore we cannot and do not track the number of unique paying users. Instead, we track the number of registered user
	accounts, active users, paying users and unique visitors. We calculate certain operating metrics in the following ways: (a)&nbsp;the
	number of registered user accounts is the cumulative number of user accounts at the end of the relevant period that have logged
	onto our platform at least once after registration, (b)&nbsp;the number of active users is the cumulative number of user accounts
	at the end of the relevant period that have signed onto our platform at least once during the relevant period, (c)&nbsp;the number
	of paying users is the cumulative number of registered user accounts that have purchased virtual items or other products and services
	on our platform at least once during the relevant period, and (d)&nbsp;the number of unique visitors is the number of visits to
	Duowan.com from specific IP addresses for the relevant period, with each IP address counting as a separate unique visitor. The
	actual number of unique individual users, however, is likely to be lower than that of registered user accounts, active users, paying
	users and unique visitors, potentially significantly, for three primary reasons. First, each individual user may register more
	than once and therefore have more than one account, and sign onto each of these accounts during a given period. For example, a
	user may (a)&nbsp;create separate accounts for community and personal use and log onto each account at different times for different
	activities or (b)&nbsp;if he or she lost his or her original username or password, he or she can simply register again and create
	an additional account. Second, we experience irregular registration activities such as the creation of a significant number of
	improper user accounts by a limited number of individuals, which may be in violation of our policies, including for the purpose
	of clogging our network or posting spam to our channels. We believe that some of these accounts may also be created for specific
	purposes such as to increase the number of votes for certain performers in various contests, but the number of registered user
	accounts, paying users and active users do not exclude user accounts created for such purposes. We have limited ability to validate
	or confirm the accuracy of information provided during the user registration process to ascertain whether a new user account created
	was actually created by an existing user who is registering duplicative accounts. Third, each individual user may access Duowan.com
	from more than one IP address; although subsequent visits from the same IP address do not add to our total unique visitors count,
	each new IP address used by an individual would be counted as a different unique visitor to Duowan.com. For example, a user would
	be counted as a unique visitor three times if he or she accessed Duowan.com from the user's home computer, office computer and
	mobile phone. Thus, the respective number of our registered user accounts, active users, paying users and unique visitors may overstate
	the number of unique individuals who register on our platform, sign onto our platform, purchase virtual items or other products
	and services on our platform and access Duowan.com, respectively which may lead to an inaccurate interpretation of our average
	revenue per paying user metric.

	An increasing number of users are accessing
	our platform through mobile devices, and we consider the rise of mobile-based business to be a general trend. We have been taking
	measures to expand our success from PC-based products and services to the mobile platform. Mobile YY, our music and entertainment
	mobile application introduced in 2010, has contributed 45.4% of the total revenue generated from our music and entertainment business
	in the forth quarter of 2015, compared to 14.4% in the same period of 2014. The ARPU of Mobile YY has reached RMB387.6 (US$59.8)
	in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to RMB531.0 (US$82.0), the average ARPU of our whole music and entertainment business.
	We have also developed numerous mobile applications for other parts of our business. An important element of our strategy is to
	continue to develop and enhance mobile applications to capture a greater share of the growing number of mobile users.

	Nevertheless, since the user experience
	and user habits on mobile devices are significantly different from those on PCs, there can be no assurance that we can succeed
	in adapting our products and services to the expectation of mobile users. If we are unable to attract and retain the increasing
	number of mobile users, or if we are slower than our competitors in developing attractive services adaptable for mobile devices,
	we may fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market or may lose existing users. In addition,
	even if we are able to retain the increasing number of mobile users, we may not be able to successfully monetize them in the future.
	For example, because of the inherent limitations of mobile devices, such as a smaller display screen space as compared to PCs,
	we may not be able to provide as many kinds of virtual items on our mobile applications as we can on YY Client, which may limit
	the monetization potential of mobile users.

	The validity, enforceability and scope of

	As we face increasing competition and as litigation becomes a more common way to resolve disputes in China, we face a higher risk

	including situations where an online service provider knows or should reasonably have known that the relevant content uploaded
	or linked to on its platform infringes the copyrights of others and the provider realizes economic benefits from such infringement
	activities. The &quot;knows or should reasonably have known&quot; element would be fulfilled under some statutorily specified circumstances.
	For example, online service providers are subject to liability if they fail to take necessary measures, such as deletion, blocking
	or disconnection, after receiving notification from the legal right holders. In particular, there have been cases in China in which
	the courts have found an online service provider to be liable for the copyrighted content posted by users which were accessible

	to professional game teams and commentators, and we believe such acquisition could enrich our live game broadcasting business.
	Past and future acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own require significant attention
	from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse
	effect on our business operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. Acquisitions
	could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of
	significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities
	of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant. In addition to possible
	shareholders' approval, we may also have to obtain approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities for the acquisitions
	and to comply with any applicable PRC laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay and costs.

	On September&nbsp;28, 2009, the GAPP, the
	National Copyright Administration and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal Publications, jointly issued a Notice
	on Further Strengthening the Administration of Pre-examination and Approval of Online Games and the Examination and Approval of
	Imported Online Games, or Circular 13. Circular 13 restates that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game-operating
	businesses in China via wholly owned, equity joint venture or cooperative joint venture investments and expressly prohibits foreign
	investors from gaining control over or participating in domestic online game operators through indirect ways such as establishing
	other joint venture companies or entering into contractual or technical arrangements such as the variable interest entity structural
	arrangements we adopted for our consolidated affiliated entities. We are not aware of any companies that have adopted a corporate
	structure that is the same as or similar to ours having been penalized or terminated under Circular 13 since the effective date
	of the circular. Furthermore, the enforcement of Circular 13 is still subject to substantial uncertainty, including possible subsequent
	joint actions by relevant authorities in charge, such as the MOC. The Regulation on Three Provisions stipulates that the MOC is
	authorized to regulate the online game industry, while the GAPP is authorized to approve the publication of online games before
	their launch on the internet. The Interpretation on Three Provisions further provides that once an online game is launched on the
	internet, it will be completely under the regulation of the MOC, and that if an online game is launched on the internet without
	obtaining prior approval from the GAPP, the MOC, instead of the GAPP, is directly responsible for investigating the game. In the
	event that we, our PRC subsidiaries or PRC consolidated affiliated entities are found to be in violation of the prohibition under
	Circular 13, the GAPP, in conjunction with the relevant regulatory authorities in charge, may impose applicable penalties, which
	in the most serious cases may include suspension or revocation of relevant licenses and registrations. In addition, various media
	sources have reported that the CSRC prepared a report proposing pre-approval by a competent central government authority of offshore
	listings by China-based companies with variable interest entity structures, such as ours, that operate in industry sectors subject
	to foreign investment restrictions. However, it is unclear whether the CSRC officially issued or submitted such a report to a higher
	level government authority or what any such report provides. Furthermore, on January 19, 2015, the MOFCOM issued a discussion draft
	of the proposed Foreign Investment Law, which may place restrictions on variable interest entity structures adopted by us, but
	the enactment timetable, interpretation, implementation and influence thereof remain unclear. See &quot;&mdash;Risks Related to
	Doing Business in China&mdash;Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation
	of draft PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance
	and business operations.&quot;

	Because of PRC restrictions on foreign ownership
	of internet-based businesses in China, we depend on contractual arrangements with our PRC consolidated affiliated entities in which
	we have no ownership interest to conduct our business. These contractual arrangements are intended to provide us with effective
	control over these entities and allow us to obtain economic benefits from them. Our PRC consolidated affiliated entities are owned
	directly by Messrs.&nbsp;David Xueling Li and Jun Lei, between whom certain shareholders are our co-founders and chief executive
	officer.
<I>
</I>
	For additional details on these ownership interests, see &quot;&mdash;Risks Related to Our Business&mdash;Our business

	of the Company.&quot; However, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control as direct ownership.
	For example, each of our PRC consolidated affiliated entities and their shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements
	with us by, among other things, failing to operate our business in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental
	to our interests. If we were the controlling shareholder of these PRC consolidated affiliated entities with direct ownership, we
	would be able to exercise our rights as shareholders to effect changes to their board of directors, which in turn could implement
	changes at the management and operational level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, as a legal matter, if our
	PRC consolidated affiliated entities or their shareholders fail to perform their obligations under these contractual arrangements,
	we may have to incur substantial costs to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies under PRC law, including contract
	remedies, which may not be sufficient or effective. In particular, the contractual arrangements provide that any dispute arising
	from these arrangements will be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission for arbitration
	in Beijing, the ruling of which will be final and binding. The legal framework and system in China, particularly those relating
	to arbitration proceedings, is not as developed as other jurisdictions such as the United States. As a result, significant uncertainties
	relating to the enforcement of legal rights through arbitration, litigation and other legal proceedings remain in China, which
	could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements and exert effective control over our consolidated affiliated
	entities. If we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant delay or other obstacles in the
	process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, our business and operations could be severely disrupted, which could materially
	and adversely affect our results of operations and damage our reputation. See &quot;&mdash;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&mdash;Uncertainties

	While playing online games or participating

	virtual assets can be important to online game players and have monetary value and, in some cases, are sold for actual money. In

	certain virtual items we issue to users based on in-game milestones they achieve or time spent playing games are transferable and
	exchangeable for our virtual currency or the other virtual items we issue to users. If the PRC regulatory authorities deem such
	transfer or exchange to be a virtual currency transaction, then in addition to being deemed to be engaging in the issuance of virtual
	currency, we may also be deemed to be providing transaction platform services that enable the trading of such virtual currency.
	Simultaneously engaging in both of these activities is prohibited under the Virtual Currency Notice. In that event, we may be required
	to cease either our virtual currency issuance activities or such deemed &quot;transaction service&quot; activities and may be subject
	to certain penalties, including mandatory corrective measures and fines. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material
	adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	In addition, the Virtual Currency Notice
	prohibits online game operators from setting game features that involve the direct payment of cash or virtual currency by players
	for the chance to win virtual items or virtual currency based on random selection through a lucky draw, wager or lottery. The notice
	also prohibits game operators from issuing currency to game players through means other than purchases with legal currency. It

	and ceased such prohibited activities and have taken adequate measures to prevent any of the above-mentioned prohibited activities,
	we cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will not take a view contrary to ours and deem such feature as prohibited
	by the Virtual Currency Notice, thereby subjecting us to penalties, including mandatory corrective measures and fines. For example,

	The PRC government has, in recent years,
	intensified regulation on various aspects of the internet industry in China. For example, the PRC government adopted more stringent
	policies to monitor the online game industry due to adverse public reaction to perceived addiction to online games, particularly
	in children and minors. On April&nbsp;15, 2007, eight PRC government authorities, including the GAPP, the Ministry of Education,
	the Ministry of Public Security and the MIIT issued a notice requiring all Chinese online game operators to adopt an &quot;anti-fatigue
	system&quot; in an effort to curb addiction to online games by minors. To help game operators identify which game players are minors,
	online game players in China are now required to register their names and identity card numbers before playing an online game,
	which information was to be submitted to and verified by the National Citizen Identity Information Center, a subordinate public
	institution of the Ministry of Public Security, as of October&nbsp;1, 2011. These restrictions could limit our ability to increase
	our online game business among minors. See &quot;Item&nbsp;4. Information on the Company&mdash;B.&nbsp;Business Overview&mdash;PRC
	Regulation&mdash;Anti-fatigue Compliance System and Real-name Registration System.&quot; In order to comply with these anti-fatigue
	rules, we set up our system so that after three hours of playing our online games, minors only receive half of the virtual items
	or other in-game benefits they would otherwise earn, and after playing for more than five hours, receive no in-game benefits. Failure
	to implement these restrictions, if detected by the relevant government agencies, may result in fines and other penalties for us,
	including the shutting down of our online game operations and license revocation. Furthermore, if these restrictions were expanded
	to apply to adult game players in the future, our online game business could be materially and adversely affected.

	the PRC government has imposed higher capital and facility requirements for the establishment of internet cafes. Governmental authorities
	may from time to time impose stricter requirements on internet cafes, such as customer age limits and regulated hours of operation.
	Since a substantial portion of our users access our platform from internet cafes, any reduction in the number, or slowdown in the

	Under the PRC enterprise income tax law

	within the PRC is considered a &quot;resident enterprise&quot; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject
	to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income. On April&nbsp;22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation,
	or the SAT, issued the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident
	Enterprise on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or SAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining

	Further to SAT Circular 82, on August&nbsp;3, 2011, the SAT issued the Administrative Measures of Enterprise Income Tax of Chinese-Controlled
	Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises (Trial), or SAT Bulletin 45, to provide more guidance on the implementation of SAT Circular

	income only if all of the following conditions are met: (a)&nbsp;the senior management and core management departments in charge
	of its daily operations function have their presence mainly in the PRC; (b)&nbsp;its financial and human resources decisions are

	enterprise's directors or senior management with voting rights habitually reside in the PRC. SAT Bulletin 45 further clarifies
	the resident status determination, post-determination administration, as well as competent tax authorities. It also specifies that
	when provided with a copy of Chinese tax resident determination certificate from a resident Chinese controlled offshore incorporated
	enterprise, the payer should not withhold 10% income tax when paying the Chinese-sourced dividends, interest, royalties, etc. to
	the Chinese controlled offshore incorporated enterprise.

	Finally, we face uncertainties on the reporting
	and consequences on private equity financing transactions, private share transfers and share exchange involving the transfer of
	shares in our company by non-resident investors. According to the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax
	for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises issued by the PRC State Administration of Taxation on December 10, 2009, with
	retroactive effect from January 1, 2008, or SAT Circular 698, and the Notice on Several Issues Concerning Enterprise Income Tax
	for Indirect Share Transfer by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, issued by the PRC State Administration of Taxation on February 3,
	2015, or SAT Circular 7, an &quot;indirect transfer&quot; of assets of a PRC resident enterprise, including equity interests in
	a PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable
	properties, if such transaction arrangement lacks reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing,
	avoiding or deferring PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise
	income tax, and tax filing or withholding obligations may be triggered, depending on the nature of the PRC taxable properties being
	transferred. According to SAT Circular 7, &ldquo;PRC taxable properties&rdquo; include assets of a PRC establishment or place of
	business, real properties in the PRC, and equity investments in PRC resident enterprises, in respect of which gains from their
	transfer by a direct holder, being a non-PRC resident enterprise, would be subject to PRC enterprise income taxes. When determining
	if there is a &quot;reasonable commercial purpose&quot; of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into consideration
	include: whether the main value of the equity interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives from PRC taxable properties;
	whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consists of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income
	mainly derives from China; whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable properties
	have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function and risk exposure; the duration of existence of the business
	model and organizational structure; the replicability of the transaction by direct transfer of PRC taxable properties; and the
	tax situation of such indirect transfer and applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements. In respect of an indirect offshore
	transfer of assets of a PRC establishment or place of business of a foreign enterprise, the resulting gain is to be included with
	the annual enterprise filing of the PRC establishment or place of business being transferred, and would consequently be subject
	to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying transfer relates to PRC real properties or to equity investments
	in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a PRC establishment or place of business of a non-resident enterprise, a
	PRC enterprise income tax at 10% would apply, subject to available preferential tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or
	similar arrangements, and the party who is obligated to make the transfer payments has the withholding obligation. Where the payor
	fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor shall declare and pay such tax to the competent tax authority by itself
	within the statutory time limit. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. Currently, neither
	SAT Circular 698 nor SAT Circular 7 applies to the sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares
	were acquired from a transaction through a public stock exchange.

	PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2008, the statutory enterprise income
	tax rate is 25%. However, Guangzhou Huaduo, our PRC consolidated affiliated entity in the PRC, renewed its qualification as a high

	be subject to apply for the renewal of HNTE in 2016. In addition, Guangzhou Huanju Shidai has been recognized as a software enterprise
	since 2013, and is therefore entitled to a two-year exemption from enterprise income tax followed by three years at 50% of the
	standard enterprise income tax rate starting from 2014, the first profit-making year. However, if either Guangzhou Huaduo or Guangzhou
	Huanju Shidai fails to maintain its qualification for preferential tax treatments, its applicable enterprise income tax rate may

	within China) must be cleared by the MOFCOM before they can be completed. In addition, on February&nbsp;3, 2011, the General Office
	of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises
	by Foreign Investors, or the Circular No.&nbsp;6, which officially established a security review system for mergers and acquisitions
	of domestic enterprises by foreign investors. Under Circular No.&nbsp;6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions
	by foreign investors having &quot;national defense and security&quot; concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors
	may acquire the &quot;de facto control&quot; of domestic enterprises with &quot;national security&quot; concerns.

	The PRC State Administration of Foreign

	and Financing and Round-Trip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, effective on July 4, 2014, and
	its appendixes, that require PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with local branches of SAFE
	in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment
	and financing, with such PRC residents' legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or
	interests, referred to in SAFE Circular No. 37 as a &quot;special purpose vehicle.&quot; SAFE Circular No. 37 further requires
	amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase
	or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In
	the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration,
	the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent
	and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in
	their ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration
	requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for foreign exchange evasion, including (i) the requirement
	by SAFE to return the foreign exchange remitted overseas within a period specified by SAFE, with a fine of up to 30% of the total
	amount of foreign exchange remitted overseas and deemed to have been evasive and (ii) in circumstances involving serious violations,
	a fine of no less than 30% of and up to the total amount of remitted foreign exchange deemed evasive. Furthermore, the persons-in-charge
	and other persons at our PRC subsidiaries who are held directly liable for the violations may be subject to criminal sanctions.

	shareholding changes in our company resulting from our initial public offering in March 2015. Since SAFE Circular No. 37 was recently
	issued, there remains uncertainty with respect to its interpretation and implementation, and we cannot predict how such SAFE regulations

	Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Ownership Plans or Stock Option Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed
	Companies issued by SAFE on March&nbsp;28, 2007. Under the Stock Option Rules and other relevant rules and regulations, PRC residents
	who participate in stock incentive plan in an overseas publicly-listed company are required to register with SAFE or its local
	branches and complete certain other procedures. Participants of a stock incentive plan who are PRC residents must retain a qualified
	PRC agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly listed company or another qualified institution selected by
	such PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the stock incentive plan on behalf of
	its participants. Such participants must also retain an overseas entrusted institution to handle matters in connection with their
	exercise of stock options, the purchase and sale of corresponding stocks or interests and fund transfers. In addition, the PRC
	agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is any material change to the
	stock incentive plan, the PRC agent or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes. We and our PRC employees who
	have been granted stock options, restricted shares and restricted share units are subject to these regulations, and are preparing

	currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45

	capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within
	the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In

	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment
	Law expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &quot;actual control&quot; in determining whether
	a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities
	established in China but &quot;controlled&quot; by foreign investors will be treated as FIEs, whereas an entity set up in a foreign
	jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the Ministry of Commerce, treated as a PRC domestic investor
	provided that the entity is &quot;controlled&quot; by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection, &quot;control&quot; is
	broadly defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i) holding 50% of more of the voting rights of
	the subject entity; (ii) holding less than 50% of the voting rights of the subject entity but having the power to secure at least
	50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power to exert material influence
	on the board, the shareholders' meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii) having the power to exert decisive
	influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity's operations, financial matters or other key aspects
	of business operations. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE and its investment amount exceeds certain thresholds or its business
	operation falls within a &quot;negative list,&quot; to be separately issued by the State Council in the future, market entry clearance
	by the MOFCOM or its local counterparts will be required. Otherwise, all foreign investors may make investments on the same terms
	as domestic investors without being subject to additional approval from the government authorities as mandated by the existing
	foreign investment legal regime.

	Assuming that we are treated as owning
	Guangzhou Huaduo, Beijing Tuda and Bilin Online for United States federal income tax purposes, we do not believe
	that we were a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, and do
	not anticipate becoming a PFIC in future taxable years. However, because PFIC status is a factual determination made annually after the close of each taxable year on the basis
	of the composition of our income and assets, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the current taxable
	year or any future taxable year. The value of our
	assets for purposes of the PFIC test will generally be determined by reference to the market price of our ADSs. Accordingly,
	fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the current taxable year or future taxable
	years. The determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC will also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our
	liquid assets. Under circumstances where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes our risk
	of being classified as a PFIC may substantially increase. It is also possible that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge
	our classification or valuation of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, which may result in our company being or,
	becoming classified as, a PFIC for the current or future taxable years. The determination of whether we will be or become a
	PFIC will also depend, in part, upon the nature of our income and assets over time, which are subject to change from year to
	year. There can be no assurance our business plans will not change in a manner that will affect our PFIC status.

	on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs or common shares and on the receipt of distributions on the ADSs or common
	shares to the extent such gain or distribution is treated as an &quot;excess distribution&quot; under the United States

	or common shares, we generally will continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such
	U.S.&nbsp;holder holds our ADSs or common shares. Alternatively, U.S. holders of PFIC shares can sometimes avoid the rules
	described above by making certain elections, including a &quot;mark-to-market&quot; election or electing to treat a PFIC as a
	&quot;qualified electing fund.&quot; However, U.S. holders will not be able to make an election to treat us as a

	to these two classes of common shares, as of March 31, 2016, our management group, including Messrs.&nbsp;David Xueling Li, Jun
	Lei and Rongjie Dong and their respective affiliates, beneficially own an aggregate of 35.8% of our outstanding shares representing
	84.1% of the total voting power and have considerable influence over all matters requiring a shareholders' vote, including election
	of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control
	will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover
	or other change of control transactions that holders of Class&nbsp;A common shares and ADSs may view as beneficial.

	Our articles of association contain provisions
	to limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. These
	provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing
	market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction.
	For example, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in
	one or more series and to fix their designations, powers, preferences, privileges, and relative participating, optional or special
	rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms
	of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our common shares,
	in the form of ADSs or otherwise. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in
	control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares,
	the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common shares and ADSs may be materially and
	adversely affected.

	We are a company limited by shares incorporated
	under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
	association, the Companies Law, Cap. 22 (Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands and the common law of
	the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary
	responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman
	Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands
	as well as from the common law of England, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding, on a
	court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands
	law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States.
	In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws than the United States. Some U.S. states, such as
	Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. In addition, shareholders
	of a Cayman Islands company may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United
	States.

	Unlike many jurisdictions in the United

	While the basic use of our platform is currently
	free, we monetize our user base through IVAS and online advertising. Currently, we primarily generate IVAS revenues through sales
	of virtual items for online music and entertainment, online dating and live game broadcasting, and game token for online games.
	We also generate IVAS revenues through our membership program whereby users pay a fixed fee to enjoy certain privileges and regular
	bonus packages. We primarily generate online advertising revenues from sales of various forms of advertising on Duowan.com and
	YY Client. We believe that we will be able to capitalize on the large and highly engaged user base of our platform by exploring
	additional monetization opportunities and diversifying our revenue sources.

	The first version of YY Client, launched
	in July 2008, had voice-enabled features that allowed online game players to communicate with large groups of fellow gamers on
	a real-time basis. Game players typically organize various guilds for players to discuss gaming strategies and communicate with
	each other in a team setting. Such online guilds, which can consist of up to thousands of players, built their own channels on
	YY Client to communicate with fellow guild members in real time when playing games online. Gradually, we further developed and
	tailored YY Client in response to the market need for a platform enabling large groups to gather, meet and socialize in real time
	online, and turned it into the rich communication social platform that it is today. We introduced live video-enabled channels beginning
	in late 2011 and have since applied video features to all our channels.

	Quality of Service, or QoS, assurance is
	a key element of any high quality delivery of voice and video data over the internet. For live voice- or video-enabled communications,
	any data packet loss and jitter, or delay in transmission, is often immediately noticeable to users. We devote significant resources
	to maintain and develop a creative combination of multiple voice- and voice-over internet protocol, or VOIP, quality assurance
	mechanisms to minimize data loss and jitter. The mechanisms we employ include but not limited to cloud-based intelligence routing,
	low-bitrate redundant solution, upstream-forward error correction and adaptive jitter. A special intelligent routing algorithm
	we designed automatically seeks optimal ways of delivering voice and video data across our cloud-based network, enabling us to
	provide better QoS even when the QoS levels are lower on certain routes.

	The Telecommunications Regulations, which
	became effective on September&nbsp;25, 2000 and have been subsequently amended respectively on July 29, 2014 and February 6, 2016,
	are the core regulations on telecommunications services in China. The Telecommunications Regulations set out basic guidelines on
	different types of telecommunications business activities, including the distinction between &quot;basic telecommunications services&quot;
	and &quot;value-added telecommunications services.&quot; According to the Catalog of Telecommunications Business (2015 Amendment),
	implemented on March 1, 2016 attached to the Telecommunications Regulations, internet information services are deemed a type of
	value-added telecommunications services. The Telecommunications Regulations require the operators of value-added telecommunications
	services to obtain value-added telecommunications business operation licenses from MIIT or its provincial delegates prior to the
	commencement of such services. Under these regulations, if the value-added telecommunications services offered include mobile network
	information services, the operation license for value-added telecommunications business must include the provision of such services
	in its covered scope. We currently, through Guangzhou Huaduo, our PRC&nbsp;consolidated affiliated entity, hold an ICP license,
	a sub-category of the value-added telecommunications business operation license, covering the provision of internet and mobile
	network information services, issued by the Guangdong branch of the MIIT on February&nbsp;10, 2012.

	On July&nbsp;13, 2006, the MIIT issued the
	Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in Value-added Telecommunications Services, or the MIIT Circular
	2006, which requires that (a)&nbsp;foreign investors can only operate a telecommunications business in China through establishing
	a telecommunications enterprise with a valid telecommunications business operation license; (b)&nbsp;domestic license holders are
	prohibited from leasing, transferring or selling telecommunications business operation licenses to foreign investors in any form,
	or providing any resource, sites or facilities to foreign investors to facilitate the unlicensed operation of telecommunications
	business in China; (c)&nbsp;value-added telecommunications service providers or their shareholders must directly own the domain

	must have the necessary facilities for its approved business operations and maintain such facilities in the geographic regions
	covered by its license; and (e)&nbsp;all value-added telecommunications service providers should improve network and information
	security, enact relevant information safety administration regulations and set up emergency plans to ensure network and information
	safety. The provincial communications administration bureaus, as local authorities in charge of regulating telecommunications services,
	(a)&nbsp;are required to ensure that existing qualified value-added telecommunications service providers will conduct a self-assessment
	of their compliance with the MIIT Circular 2006 and submit status reports to the MIIT before November&nbsp;1, 2006; and (b)&nbsp;may
	revoke the value-added telecommunications business operation licenses of those that fail to comply with the above requirements
	or fail to rectify such non-compliance within specified time limits. Due to the lack of any additional interpretation from the

	If an internet information service provider detects information transmitted on their system that falls within the specifically

	in internet publishing, which means any act by an internet information service provider to select, edit and process content or
	programs and to make such content or programs publicly available on the internet. The provision of online games is deemed an internet
	publication activity; therefore, an online game operator must (i)&nbsp;obtain an Internet Publishing License so that it can directly

	be approved by the competent administrative department for publications and a Network Publication Services Permit must be obtained.
	Pursuant to the Network Publication Measures, network publication services refer to the use of information networks to provide

	of continuous playing by minors, defined as game players under 18&nbsp;years of age, is considered to be &quot;healthy&quot;, three
	to five hours is deemed &quot;fatiguing&quot;, and five hours or more is deemed &quot;unhealthy.&quot; Game operators are required

	commissions in the form of virtual currency in connection with winning or losing of games; (b)&nbsp;requires online game operators
	to impose limits on use of virtual currency in guessing and betting games; (c)&nbsp;bans the conversion of virtual currency into

	To comply with the relevant section of the circular that bans the conversion of virtual currency into real currency or property,
	in relation to online music and entertainment, our virtual currency currently can only be used by users to exchange into virtual
	items to be used to show support for performers or gain access to privileges and special features in the channels which are services
	in nature instead of &quot;real currency or property.&quot; Once the virtual currency is exchanged by users for virtual items or
	the relevant privileged services, the conversion transaction is completed and we immediately cancel the virtual item in our internal
	system. In the case of virtual items used as gifts to performers, we cancel the virtual items and record corresponding points for
	the benefit of the performers and the channel owners, which are then used as basis for the revenue-sharing calculation pursuant
	to arrangements among us, certain popular performers and channel owners.

	To further clarify some key internet copyright
	issues, on December&nbsp;27, 2012, the PRC Supreme People's Court promulgated the Regulation on Several Issues Concerning Applicable
	Laws on Trial of Civil Disputes over the Infringement of Information Network Transmission Right, or the 2013 Regulation. The 2013
	Regulation took effect on January&nbsp;1, 2013, and replaced the Interpretations on Some Issues Concerning Applicable Laws for
	Trial of Disputes over Internet Copyright that was initially adopted in 2000 and subsequently amended in 2004 and 2006. Under the
	2013 Regulation, where an internet information service provider work in cooperation with others to jointly provide works, performances,
	audio and video products of which the right holders have information network transmission right, such behavior will constitute
	joint infringement of third parties' information network transmission right, and the PRC court shall order such internet information
	service provider to assume join liability for such infringement. If an internet information service provider can prove that it
	has only provided network services through automatic access, automatic transmission, data storage space, search functions, links,
	document sharing technology, etc., and thereby argues that it has not been involved in any alleged joint infringement, the PRC
	court shall find in favor of such internet information service provider. If an internet information service provider fails to delete,
	block, disconnect or take other necessary measures, or if it provides technological support or other aid when it knows or should
	have known of the network user's infringement on the information network transmission right, the PRC court shall find that such
	aid constitutes contributory infringement. The PRC court shall determine whether an internet information service provider is liable
	for abetting or contributory infringement according to its findings on the degree of fault of the internet information service
	provider. The fault of the internet information service provider is determined according to various criteria, including situations
	where such provider knew or should have known of the network user's infringement against third party's information network transmission
	right. If an internet information service provider can prove it has adopted fairly reasonable and effective technological measures,
	and yet still finds it difficult to discover infringement against information network transmission conducted by the network user,
	the PRC court shall find such provider to be not at fault. Where an internet information service provider promotes popular video
	and films through setting up a list, directory, index, descriptive paragraph, briefing or other means of recommendation, and the
	public can download, browse or acquire them through other methods directly from the internet information service provider's webpage,
	the PRC court may find that such provider knew of the network user's infringement on the information network transmission right
	of others.

	Since 2005, the NCA, together with certain
	other PRC governmental authorities, have jointly launched annual campaigns specifically aimed to crack down on internet copyright
	infringement and piracy in China; these campaigns normally last for three to four months every year. According to the Notice of
	2010 Campaign to Crack Down on Internet Infringement and Piracy promulgated by the NCA, the Ministry of Public Security and the
	MIIT on July&nbsp;19, 2010, the 2010 campaign mainly targeted internet audio and video programs, literature websites, online games,
	animation, software and art works related to Shanghai World Expo and Guangzhou Asian Games. During the 2010 campaign, starting
	from late July to the end of October 2010, the local branches of NCA focused on popular movies and TV series, newly published books,
	online games and animation, music and software and various illegal activities, including, for example, illegal uploading or transmission
	of a thirty party's works without proper license or permission, sales of pirated audio-video and software through e-commerce platforms,
	providing search links, information storage, web hosting or internet access services for third parties engaging in copyright infringement
	or piracy of copyrighted works and the infringement by use of mobile media. In serious cases, the operating permits of the websites
	engaging illegal activities were revoked, and such websites were ordered to shut down.

	&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

	August 2008, or the FEA Regulations. Under the FEA Regulations, the Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, including
	the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital
	account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless
	the prior approval of the SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. On August&nbsp;29, 2008, SAFE promulgated
	Circular 142 to regulate the conversion of foreign currency into Renminbi by a foreign-invested enterprise by restricting the ways
	in which the converted Renminbi may be used. Circular 142 stipulates that the registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise
	that has been settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved

	Since SAFE Circular 142 has been in place
	for more than five years, in 2014, SAFE decided to further reform the foreign exchange administration system in order to satisfy
	and facilitate the business and capital operations of foreign invested enterprises, and issued the Circular on the Relevant Issues
	Concerning the Launch of Reforming Trial of the Administration Model of the Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested
	Enterprises in Certain Areas on July 4, 2014, or SAFE Circular 36. SAFE Circular 36 suspends the application of SAFE Circular 142
	in certain areas and allows a foreign-invested enterprise registered in such areas to use the RMB capital converted from foreign
	currency registered capital for equity investments within the PRC, which will be regarded as the reinvestment of foreign-invested
	enterprise. On March 30, 2015, SAFE issued the Circular on the Reforming of the Management Method of the Settlement of Foreign
	Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, which took effect on June 1, 2015, and replaced SAFE Circular
	142 and SAFE Circular 36. Under SAFE Circular 19, a foreign-invested enterprise may also choose to convert its registered capital
	from foreign currency to RMB on a discretionary basis, and the RMB capital so converted can be used for equity investments within
	PRC, which will be regarded as the reinvestment of foreign-invested enterprise.

	on behalf of the PRC residents who have the right to exercise the employee share options, apply to SAFE or its local branches for
	an annual quota for the payment of foreign currencies in connection with the PRC residents' exercise of the employee share options.
	The foreign exchange proceeds received by the PRC residents from the sale of shares under the stock incentive plans granted and
	dividends distributed by the overseas listed companies must be remitted into the bank accounts in the PRC opened by the PRC agents

	The PRC enterprise income tax is calculated
	based on the taxable income determined under the applicable EIT Law and its implementation rules. On March&nbsp;16, 2007, the National
	People's Congress of China enacted the New EIT Law, which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2008. On December&nbsp;6, 2007, the
	State Council promulgated the implementation rules to the New EIT Law, which also became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2008. The
	New EIT Law imposes a uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25% on all resident enterprises in China, including foreign-invested
	enterprises and domestic enterprises, unless they qualify for certain exceptions, and terminates most of the tax exemptions, reductions
	and preferential treatment available under the previous tax laws and regulations. According to the New EIT Law and relevant regulations,
	subject to the approval of competent tax authorities, the income tax of an enterprise that has been determined to be a high and

	transfer of PRC taxable properties, if such transaction arrangement lacks of reasonable commercial purpose and was established

	may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and tax filing or withholding obligations may be triggered, depending on the nature

	from PRC taxable properties; whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consists of direct or indirect investment

	of existence of the business model and organizational structure; the replicability of the transaction by direct transfer of PRC
	taxable properties; and the tax situation of such indirect transfer and applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements. In respect
	of an indirect offshore transfer of assets of a PRC establishment or place of business of a foreign enterprise, the resulting gain
	is to be included with the annual enterprise filing of the PRC establishment or place of business being transferred, and would
	consequently be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying transfer relates to PRC real properties
	or to equity investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a PRC establishment or place of business of a non-resident
	enterprise, a PRC enterprise income tax at 10% would apply, subject to available preferential tax treatment under applicable tax
	treaties or similar arrangements, and the party who is obligated to make the transfer payments has the withholding obligation.
	Where the payor fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor shall declare and pay such tax to the competent tax authority
	by itself within the statutory time limit. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. Currently,
	neither SAT Circular 698 nor SAT Circular 7 applies to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange
	where such shares were acquired from a transaction through a public stock exchange.

	On January&nbsp;1, 2012, the State Administration
	of Taxation officially launched a pilot VAT reform program (&quot;Pilot Program&quot;), applicable to businesses in selected industries.
	Taxable income derived from the businesses in the Pilot Program is subject to VAT in lieu of business tax. The Pilot Program initially
	applied only to transportation industry and &quot;modern service industries&quot; (&quot;Pilot Industries&quot;) in Shanghai in
	2011 and expanded to eight trial regions (including Beijing and Guangdong province) and nationwide progressively from August to
	December 2012. The Pilot Industries in Shanghai included industries involving the leasing of tangible movable property, transportation
	services, research and development and technical services, information technology services, cultural and creative services, logistics
	and ancillary services, certification and consulting services. Revenues generated by advertising services, a type of &quot;cultural
	and creative services&quot;, are subject to the VAT tax rate of 6%. According to official announcements made by competent authorities
	in Beijing and Guangdong province, Beijing launched the same Pilot Program on September&nbsp;1, 2012, and Guangdong province launched
	it on November&nbsp;1, 2012. In addition, the Supplementary Notice on Several Tax Policies in Relation to the Scope of VAT-able
	and Other Matters in the Transportation and Selected Modern Service Sectors under the VAT Reform Pilot Program, Caishui [2012]
	No.&nbsp;86, or Circular 86, which was issued in December 2012, further defines the application scope of relevant industries and
	specifies that, starting from December&nbsp;1, 2012, website operation services provided by website owners for non-self-owned online
	games are taxed as &ldquo;Information System Services,&rdquo; and therefore would also be subject to the VAT tax rate as 6%. Going
	forward, in Guangdong province, we will pay the pilot VAT instead of business taxes for our advertising activities, operating services
	for online games not owned by us and for any other parts of our business that are deemed by the competent state tax authorities
	to be in the scope of the Pilot Industries.

	On December 12, 2013, the Ministry of
	Finance and the SAT issued the Circular on Including the Railway Transportation and Postal Industries in the Pilot Program of
	Replacing Business Tax with Value-Added Tax, or the Pilot Collection Circular. The scope of certain modern services
	industries under the Pilot Collection Circular is expanded to cover research and development and technical services, cultural
	and creative services, and radio, film and television services. In addition, according to the Notice on Including the
	Telecommunications Industry in the Pilot Program of Levying Value-added Tax in Lieu of Business Tax, which became effective
	on June 1, 2014, the scope of certain modern services industries under the Pilot Collection Circular is further expanded to
	cover the telecommunications industry. Except for online games revenues, IVAS revenues became subject to VAT from June 1,
	2014, at a rate of 6%, while they were subject to business taxes at a rate of 3% prior to June 1, 2014. Other revenues,
	including online games revenues, are subject to VAT for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.

	We began our operations in 2005 by launching
	Duowan.com, a popular online web portal hosting game media content. We have grown significantly in recent years, developing and
	introducing YY&nbsp;Client in 2008 and extending our services into mobile devices in September 2010 and onto web browsers in October
	2012. Our business has also expanded from focusing on providing voice communication services to becoming a multifaceted social
	entertainment platform. We offer a variety of interactive content on our platform, such as online music shows, live online game
	streaming, and online dating shows, which give our users a more diverse, immersive, engaging and enriching experience.

	We derive our revenues primarily from IVAS
	and online advertising. We derived 91.0%, 96.0% and 96.0% of our total net revenues from IVAS in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively,
	with online education revenue, online advertising revenue and e-commerce revenue accounting for the remainder of our revenues.
	Revenues from IVAS are primarily generated through online music and entertainment, online games, online dating, live game broadcasting
	and other services on our platform. Online education revenues are primarily generated from our online education platform, 100 Education,
	and online advertising revenues are primarily generated from sales of different forms of advertising on Duowan.com. As we continue
	to expand our IVAS offerings and our user engagement and spending levels increase, our revenue sharing fees and content costs have
	increased significantly in recent years, resulting in lower gross margin. We have been exploring additional monetization opportunities
	and diversifying our revenue sources in order to capitalize on the large and highly engaged user base of our platform.

	An increasing number of users are accessing
	our platform through mobile devices, and we consider the rise of mobile-based business to be a general trend. Mobile YY, our music
	and entertainment mobile application, has contributed 45.4% of the total revenue generated from our music and entertainment business
	in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 14.4% in the same period of 2014. The ARPU of Mobile YY has reached RMB387.6 (US$59.8)
	in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to RMB531.0 (US$82.0), the average ARPU of our whole music and entertainment business.
	We have been taking measures to expand our success from PC-based products and services to the mobile platform. In October 2013,
	we introduced virtual item purchase functions on Mobile YY to accelerate the monetization of our mobile platform. In February 2016,
	we released our mobile broadcasting application, ME Live, which allows users to perform and make broadcasts with a single mobile
	device. We have also developed numerous mobile applications for other parts of our business. An important element of our strategy
	is to continue to develop and enhance mobile applications to capture a greater share of the growing number of mobile users.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;We had approximately 3.2&nbsp;million, 4.9&nbsp;million and 7.2&nbsp;million

	number of registered user accounts that have purchased virtual items or other products and services on our platform at least once
	during the relevant period. We were able to achieve an increase in the number of paying users primarily due to a larger active
	user base and a higher conversion ratio of active users to paying users, and we expect that the number of our paying users will
	continue to grow in the future as we expand our services and products offerings and further monetize our existing platform.

	respectively. ARPU is calculated by dividing our total revenues from IVAS during a given period by the number of paying users for
	that period. As we begin to generate revenues from an increasing variety of IVAS, our ARPU may fluctuate from period to period
	due to the mix of IVAS purchased by our paying users.

	We expect that the portion of our revenues
	from IVAS derived from the sales of non-game virtual items and services will continue to increase as we capitalize on monetization
	opportunities. We create and offer to users virtual items that can be used on various channels. Users can purchase consumable virtual
	items from us to show support for their favorite performers or time-based virtual items that provide users with recognized status,
	such as priority speaking rights or special symbols on the music and entertainment channels. The percentage of our total net revenues
	attributable to virtual items sold on our online music and entertainment channels was 46.8%, 57.3%, and 56.3% in 2013, 2014 and
	2015.

	The online games we currently offer are
	primarily web games that can be run from an internet browser and require an internet connection to play. We have historically derived
	a significant portion of our revenues from a number of popular online games, primarily through selling in-game virtual items for
	these games. A majority of our popular online games are developed by third party game developers under revenue-sharing arrangements
	that typically last one to two years. We derive an increasingly lower percentage of our revenues from online games as a whole,
	as we expect to monetize other non-game aspects of the YY platform, such as online music and entertainment, online dating and live
	game broadcasting.

	Other revenues.
</I>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
	generated other revenues from our online education platform, 100 Education, online advertising revenues from Duowan.com and e-commerce.
	Online education services consist of vocational training and language training courses. Revenue is recognized over the period the
	online course is available to the students, which generally is from the enrolment date to the completion of the relevant professional
	examination date. We enter into advertising contracts with both advertisers and advertising agencies. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, a
	vast majority of our online advertising revenues were derived from pay-for-time arrangements under which we charge advertisers
	depending on the duration of display for an advertisement or a series of advertisements.

	Research and development expenses consist

	and depreciation of office premises and servers utilized by the research and development personnel. Research and development expenses

	personnel to accommodate the growth of our business. We expect our research and development expenses in absolute amount to increase
	as we intend to retain existing research and development personnel and also hire new ones to, among other things, develop new series
	of applications for our platform, improve technology infrastructure to further enhance user experience, and further develop enhanced

	It was noted that 100 Online and

	market competition and the resignation of a number of key personnel. Based on the result of the annual impairment assessment,

	payable amounting to RMB185.2 million (US$ 28.6 million) in relation to the contingent consideration was reversed, for Beifu,

	items bundled within the same arrangement, we evaluate such arrangements under ASC 605-25
<I>
	Multiple-Element Arrangements
</I>
	.
	We identify individual elements under the arrangement and determine if such elements meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate
	units of accounting. We allocate the arrangement consideration to separate units of accounting based on their relative selling
	price. The following hierarchy has been followed when determining the relative selling price for each element: (1)&nbsp;vendor
	specific objective evidence, or VSOE, (2)&nbsp;third party evidence, or TPE, and (3)&nbsp;best estimate of selling price, or BESP.
	Given that the VSOE of the selling price cannot be determined, we have adopted a policy to allocate the consideration of the whole
	arrangement to different virtual item elements based on the TPE of selling price or the BESP for each virtual item element. We
	determine the fair values of virtual items sold in a bundle based on similar products sold separately on the YY platform based
	on the TPE of selling price and determine the fair values of virtual items without similar products sold separately on the YY platform
	based on the BESP. The BESP is generally based on the selling prices of the various elements of a similar nature when they are
	sold to users on a stand-alone basis. The BESP may also be based on the estimated stand-alone pricing when the element has not
	previously been sold on a stand-alone basis. These estimates are generally determined based on pricing strategies, market factors
	and strategic objectives. We recognize revenue for each virtual item element in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition
	method.

	In addition to regular courses, we also provide
	a package of several regular courses to students, which have individual fair value in the market. Pursuant to the applicable accounting
	guidance, we have accounted for these course packages as a multiple-element arrangement because each individual course qualifies
	as a single unit of accounting, and allocated the course fee from the course package to each individual course in the package
	based on its relative fair value. We recognize revenue equal to the fair value allocated to individual courses proportionately
	as the classes are attended.

	Students are granted a right to retake the
	courses at a substantial discount in the circumstances where the students fail to achieve certain score targets for some specific
	courses. The discount arrangement has a stand-alone value and qualifies as a separate unit of accounting under U.S. GAAP. Therefore,
	we have accounted for those courses as a multiple-element arrangement and allocated a portion of the initial course fee to the
	substantial discount based on a breakage rate. The breakage rate is determined based on our historical data. The amount allocated
	to the substantial discount is deferred and recognized as revenue upon the expiration of the retaking right, which is generally
	six months after the end of the initial course term.

	Where our customers purchase multiple advertising
	spaces with different display periods in the same contract, we allocate the total consideration to the various advertising elements
	based on relative selling price method and recognize revenue for the different elements over their respective display periods.
	The following hierarchy should be followed when determining the appropriate selling price for each element: (1) vendor specific
	objective evidence (&ldquo;VSOE&rdquo;), (2) third party evidence (&ldquo;TPE&rdquo;), and (3) best estimate of selling price
	(&ldquo;BESP&rdquo;). Given that the VSOE or TPE of the selling price cannot be determined, we have adopted a policy to allocate
	the fair values of different advertising elements based on the best estimate selling prices of each advertisement within the contract
	taking into consideration the standard price list and historical discounts granted. We recognize revenue on the elements delivered
	and defers the recognition of revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements until the remaining obligations have been
	satisfied. Where all of the elements within an arrangement are delivered uniformly over the agreement period, the revenues are
	recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period.

	Purchase consideration generally consists of
	cash, contingent consideration and equity securities. In estimating the fair value of equity compensation, we consider both income
	and market approach and selected the methodology that is most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market
	participants as of the measurement date. Under the market approach, we utilize publicly-traded comparable company information
	to determine the revenue and earnings multiples that are used to value our equity securities. Under the income approach, we determine
	the fair value of our equity securities based on the estimated future cash flow discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost
	of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
	We base the cash flow projections on forecasted cash flows derived from the most recent annual financial forecast using a terminal
	value based on the perpetuity growth model.

	under each scenario and the expected probability of each scenario.

	Goodwill represents the amount by which the
	cost of acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase.
	Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units that are expected
	to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arises for the purpose of impairment testing. If the carrying value
	of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill
	exceeds its fair value. We have determined that the reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are the operating segments
	that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the
	operating results.

	The carrying amounts of investment, long-lived

	impaired if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flow is less than carrying amount of the assets. The impairment to be recognized
	is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. RMB0.9&nbsp;million
	of impairment of an investment was recognized for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, RMB4.0&nbsp;million of impairment of

	Current income tax is provided on the basis

	an asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences
	by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
	and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount attributed to that asset
	or liability for tax purpose. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in statement of operations and

	We currently have deferred tax assets resulting
	from net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, all of which are available to reduce future tax payable
	in our significant tax jurisdictions. The largest component of our deferred assets are the temporary differences generated by
	our PRC subsidiary and VIE due to recognition of the deferred revenue. In assessing whether such deferred tax assets can be realized
	in the future, we need to make judgments and estimates on the ability of each of our PRC subsidiary and VIE to generate taxable
	income in the future years. To the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire amount of
	deferred tax assets will not be realized, we established a total valuation allowance to offset the deferred tax assets. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, a total valuation allowance of RMB22.2&nbsp;million, RMB24.4&nbsp;million and RMB53.3 million
	(US$8.2&nbsp;million), respectively, was recognized against deferred tax assets. If we subsequently determine that all or a portion
	of the temporary differences are more like than not to be realized, the valuation allowance will be released, which will result
	in a tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations.

	We adopted the guidance on accounting for uncertainty
	in income taxes on January&nbsp;1, 2008. The guidance prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition
	and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Guidance was also provided on derecognition of
	income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest
	and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. Significant
	judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining the relevant provision for income taxes. The adjustment
	to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January&nbsp;1, 2008 as a result of the implementation of the guidance was zero.

	cost of revenues was due in large part to an increase in our revenue sharing fees and content costs, which consist of the payments
	to performers, channel owners and content providers, which amounted to RMB1,134.0&nbsp;million in 2014, representing a 155.4%
	increase from RMB444.1&nbsp;million in 2013. This increase in revenue sharing fees and content costs was primarily due to higher
	levels of user engagement and spending as well as an increasing number of emerging new business lines in different categories.
	Bandwidth costs increased 70.2% from RMB203.2&nbsp;million in 2013 to RMB345.9&nbsp;million in 2014 to support our growing business
	operations. In addition, salary and welfare costs increased 49.0% from RMB88.5&nbsp;million in 2013 to RMB131.8&nbsp;million in
	2014, mainly due to our hiring of additional employees to serve our rapidly expanding user base.

	models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining

	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01:
	Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this Update make targeted improvements
	to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as follows: 1) Require equity investments (except those accounted for under
	the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes
	in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable
	fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions
	for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. 2) Simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without
	readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates
	that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. 3) Eliminate the requirement to disclose
	the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities. 4) Eliminate
	the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value
	that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. 5) Require public
	business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.
	6) Require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of
	a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability
	at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. 7) Require separate presentation of financial
	assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables)
	on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 8) Clarify that an entity should evaluate the need
	for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity&rsquo;s
	other deferred tax assets. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of
	the standard on our consolidated financial statements.

	As of March 31, 2016, 1,098,859,244 of our
	common shares were issued and outstanding, including 369,557,976 Class&nbsp;B common shares and 729,301,268 Class&nbsp;A common
	shares. Based on a review of the register of members maintained by our Cayman Islands corporate administrator, we believe that
	as of March 31, 2016, 729,301,268 Class&nbsp;A common shares (excluding shares being held in reserve by our depositary for the
	exercise/vesting of the share incentive awards we issue) representing approximately 66.4% of our total outstanding shares were
	held by three record holders in the United States; all of the 729,301,268 Class&nbsp;A common shares were held of record by Deutsche
	Bank Trust Company Americas, the depositary of our ADS program. The number of beneficial owners of our ADSs in the United States
	is likely to be much larger than the number of record holders of our common shares in the United States. None of our existing

	YY&nbsp;Inc., our Cayman Islands holding company, is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, our world-wide
	income could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25%, which could materially reduce our net income. In addition, we will also be
	subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, although dividends paid by one PRC tax resident to another
	PRC tax resident should qualify as &quot;tax-exempt income&quot; under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we cannot assure you
	that dividends by our PRC subsidiaries to our Cayman holding company will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign
	exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax on dividends, and the PRC tax authorities have not yet issued guidance
	with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise
	income tax purposes. In addition, ADS holders may be subject to PRC withholding tax on dividends payable by us and gains realized
	on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or common shares, if the PRC tax authorities determine that our Cayman Islands holding
	company is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. See &quot;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Doing Business
	in China&mdash;Under the PRC enterprise income tax law, we may be classified as a PRC &quot;resident enterprise,&quot; which could

	The following is a summary of
	certain United States federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition of our ADSs or common
	shares by a U.S. holder (as defined below) that holds our ADSs or common shares as &quot;capital assets&quot; (generally,
	property held for investment) under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &quot;Code&quot;). This
	summary is based upon existing United States federal income tax law, which is subject to differing interpretations or change,
	possibly with retroactive effect. This summary does not discuss all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may
	be important to particular holders in light of their particular circumstances, including holders subject
	to special tax rules (for example, banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, pension
	plans, cooperatives, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, traders in securities that have elected
	the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, partnerships and their partners, and tax-exempt
	organizations (including private foundations)), holders who are not U.S. holders, holders who own (directly, indirectly, or
	constructively) 10% or more of our voting stock, holders that hold their ADSs or common shares as part of a straddle,
	hedge, conversion, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, persons
	who acquired ADSs or common shares pursuant to the exercise of any employee share option or otherwise as compensation, or
	holders that have a functional currency other than the United States dollar, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that
	differ significantly from those summarized below. In addition, except to the extent described below, this summary does not
	discuss any state, local or non-United States tax considerations, Medicare tax, the alternative minimum tax or any non-income
	tax (such as the United States federal estate or gift tax) considerations. Each U.S. holder is urged to consult its tax
	advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local, and non-United States income and other tax considerations relating
	to the ownership and disposition of our ADSs or common shares.

	for United States federal income tax purposes, for the taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, and do not anticipate
	becoming a PFIC in future taxable years. However, because PFIC status is a factual determination made annually after the close of each taxable year on the basis

	year or any future taxable year. The value of our assets, for

	Accordingly, fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs and common shares may cause us to become a PFIC for the current
	taxable year or future taxable years. It is also possible that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge our classification
	or valuation of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, which may result in our company being or, becoming classified
	as, a PFIC for the current or future taxable years. The determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC will also

	which is an established securities market in the United States. Since we do not expect that our common shares will be listed on
	established securities markets, it is unclear whether dividends that we pay on our common shares that are not backed by ADSs currently

	qualify as being regularly traded, but no assurances may be given in this regard. Because a mark-to-market election cannot be made
	for equity interests in any lower-tier PFICs that we own, a U.S. holder may continue to be subject to the PFIC rules with respect
	to its indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated as an equity interest in a PFIC for United States federal
	income tax purposes. If a mark-to-market election is made, the U.S. holder will generally (i)&nbsp;include as ordinary income for
	each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ADSs held at the end of the taxable year over
	the adjusted tax basis of such ADSs and (ii)&nbsp;deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of the
	ADSs over the fair market value of such ADSs held at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously
	included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the ADSs would be adjusted
	to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election.

	The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar
	and other currencies is affected by changes in China&rsquo;s political and economic conditions and by China&rsquo;s foreign exchange
	policies, among other things. In July 2005, the PRC government changed its decades-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to
	the U.S. dollar, and the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008
	and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band.
	Since June 2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict
	how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.
	To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from our initial public offering into Renminbi for our operations,
	appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion.
	Conversely, if we decide to convert the Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common
	shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect
	on the U.S. dollar amounts available to us.

	The depositary fees payable for cash distributions
	are generally deducted from the cash being distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. In the
	case of distributions other than cash (i.e.,&nbsp;share dividends, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the
	ADS record date holders concurrent with the distribution. In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated
	or uncertificated in direct registration), the depositary bank sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders. In the
	case of ADSs held in brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary bank generally collects its fees through the systems
	provided by DTC (whose nominee is the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians holding ADSs in
	their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who hold their clients' ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients' accounts
	the amount of the fees paid to the depositary banks.

	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
	balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders&rsquo;
	equity and of cash flows, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of YY Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
	and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
	three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
	as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
	of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements,
	for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
	over financial reporting, included in Management&rsquo;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Report appearing under Item
	15 of the accompanying Form 20-F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's
	internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
	of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
	control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining,
	on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
	control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
	risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
	on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

	A company&rsquo;s internal control over
	financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
	the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&rsquo;s
	internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records
	that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
	generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
	authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or

	The equity investment is comprised
	of investments in privately-held companies. The Group accounts for its equity investment over which it has significant influence
	but does not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method. The Group adjusts the carrying amount
	of the investment and recognizes investment income or loss for share of the earnings or loss of the investee after the date of
	investment. The Group assesses its equity investment for other-than-temporary impairment by considering factors including, but
	not limited to, current economic and market conditions, operating performance of the companies, including current earnings trends
	and undiscounted cash flows, and other company-specific information. The fair value determination, particularly for investment
	in privately-held companies, requires judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions. Changes in these estimates and
	assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investment and determination of whether any identified impairment
	is other-than-temporary.

	The Group classifies its investments

	has the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity are classified as &ldquo;held to maturity&rdquo; and reported at amortized
	cost; (ii) debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are
	classified as &ldquo;trading securities&rdquo; with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings; (iii) debt and equity
	securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading securities are classified as &ldquo;available-for-sale&rdquo; and reported
	at fair value. The Group has designated its investment in redeemable preferred shares of one company as available-for-sale debt
	security in accordance with ASC 320-10 (Note 10). Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from
	earnings and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Realized gains or losses upon disposal are
	charged to earnings during the period in which the gains or losses are realized. An impairment loss on the available-for-sale securities
	is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income when the decline in value is determined to
	be other-than-temporary.

	For long-lived assets other than
	investments and goodwill whose impairment is discussed elsewhere in the financial statements, the Group evaluates for impairment
	whenever events or changes (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. The
	Group assesses the recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the estimated
	undiscounted future cash flows expected to receive from use of the assets and their eventual disposition. Such assets are considered
	to be impaired if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. The impairment
	to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The
	Group tests impairment of long-lived assets at the reporting unit level when impairment indicator appeared and recognizes impairment
	in the event that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of each reporting unit.

	Goodwill assessment for impairment
	is performed on at least an annual basis on October&nbsp;1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
	value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Group performs a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step compares the
	fair values of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its
	carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting
	unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit&rsquo;s goodwill to
	the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business
	combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting
	unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied
	fair value of goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result
	in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value
	of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating
	future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions
	could materially affect the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.

	The Group creates and offers virtual
	items to be used by users on online music and entertainment channels, which the Group operates and maintains. The virtual items
	are offered free of charge or sold to users at different specified prices as pre-determined by the Company. Online music and entertainment
	revenue consists of sales of virtual items. Users purchase consumable virtual items from the Group and present them to performers
	to show support for their favorite performers or time-based virtual items, which provide users with recognized status, such as
	priority speaking rights or special symbols on the music channels for a specific period of time. In order to attract user traffic,
	the Group shares with certain popular performers and channel owners, who have entered into revenue sharing arrangements with the
	Group, a portion of the revenues the Group derives from such in-channel virtual item sales on online music and entertainment channels,
	which the Group accounts for as cost of revenues. Performers and channel owners, who do not have revenue sharing arrangements with
	the Group, are not entitled to share any revenue derived from the virtual items sold. The Group does not recognize any revenue
	from offering free virtual items nor share any revenue with performers or channel owners when free virtual items are presented
	to performers by the users. Accordingly, online music and entertainment revenue is recognized for the sale of virtual items in
	online music and entertainment channels immediately if the virtual item is a consumable or, in the case of time-based virtual items,
	recognized ratably over the period when the virtual item is made available to the user, which does not exceed one year. The Group
	does not have further obligations to the user after the virtual items are consumed. Virtual items may be sold individually or bundled
	into one arrangement. When the Group&rsquo;s users purchase multiple virtual items bundled within the same arrangement, the Group
	evaluates such arrangements under ASC 605-25 Multiple-Element Arrangements. The Group identifies individual elements under the
	arrangement and determines if such elements meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate units of accounting. The Group allocates
	the arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price.

	the VSOE of the selling price cannot be determined, the Group has adopted a policy to allocate the consideration of the whole arrangement
	to different virtual item elements based on the TPE of selling price or the BESP for each virtual item element. The Group determines
	the fair values of virtual items sold in a bundle based on similar products sold separately on the YY platform based on the TPE
	of the selling price and determines the fair values of virtual items without similar products sold separately on the YY platform
	based on the BESP. The BESP is generally based on the selling prices of the various elements of a similar nature when they are
	sold to users on a stand-alone basis. The BESP may also be based on an estimated stand-alone pricing when the element has not previously
	been sold on a stand-alone basis.

	When the Group launches a new

	The estimated user relationship
	period is based on data collected from those users who have acquired game tokens. To estimate the user relationship period, the
	Group maintains a system that captures the following information for each user: (a)&nbsp;the frequency that users log into each
	game via the Group&rsquo;s platform, and (b)&nbsp;the amount and the timing of when the users convert or charge his or her game
	tokens. The Group estimates the user relationship period for a particular game to be the date a player purchases or converts from
	virtual currency to a game token through the date the Group estimates the user plays the game for the last time. This computation
	is performed on a user by user basis. Then, the results for all analyzed users are averaged to determine an estimated end user
	relationship period for each game. Revenues from in-game payments of each month are recognized over the user relationship period
	estimated for that game.

	Advertising revenues are derived
	principally from advertising arrangements where the advertisers pay to place their advertisements on the Group&rsquo;s platform
	in different formats over a particular period of time. Such formats generally include but are not limited to banners, text-links,
	videos, logos, and buttons. Advertisements on the Group&rsquo;s platform are generally charged on the basis of duration, and advertising
	contracts are signed to establish the fixed price and the advertising services to be provided. Where collectability is reasonably
	assured, advertising revenues from advertising contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period of display.

	Where customers purchase multiple
	advertising spaces with different display periods in the same contract, the Group allocates the total consideration to the various
	advertising elements based on the relative selling price method and recognizes revenue for the different elements over their respective
	display periods. The following hierarchy should be followed when determining the appropriate selling price for each element: (1)&nbsp;vendor
	specific objective evidence (&ldquo;VSOE&rdquo;), (2)&nbsp;third party evidence (&ldquo;TPE&rdquo;), and (3)&nbsp;best estimate
	of selling price (&ldquo;BESP&rdquo;). Given that the VSOE or TPE of the selling price cannot be determined, the Group has adopted
	a policy to allocate the fair values of different advertising elements based on the best estimate selling prices of each advertisement
	within the contract taking into consideration the standard price list and historical discounts granted. The Group recognizes revenue
	on the elements delivered and defers the recognition of revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements until the remaining
	obligations have been satisfied. Where all of the elements within an arrangement are delivered uniformly over the agreement period,
	the revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period.

	In February 2015, the FASB issued
	Consolidation (Topic 810) &mdash;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The amendments in Topic 810 respond to stakeholders&rsquo;
	concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities, by changing aspects of the analysis that
	a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate such entities. Under the amendments, all reporting entities
	are within the scope of Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation&mdash;Overall, including limited partnerships and similar legal entities,
	unless a scope exception applies. The amendments are intended to be an improvement to current U.S. GAAP, as they simplify the codification
	of FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), with changes including reducing the number of consolidation
	models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining
	a controlling financial interest. The amendments are effective for publicly-traded companies for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating
	the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.

	In January 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU 2016-01: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this Update make targeted
	improvements to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as follows: 1) Require equity investments (except those accounted
	for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with
	changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily
	determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly
	transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. 2) Simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments
	without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment
	indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. 3) Eliminate the requirement to
	disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities.
	4) Eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate
	the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. 5) Require
	public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.
	6) Require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a
	liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at
	fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. 7) Require separate presentation of financial assets
	and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on
	the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 8) Clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for
	a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity&rsquo;s other
	deferred tax assets. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact
	of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.

	In February 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842). The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that
	arise from leases. All leases create an asset and a liability for the lessee in accordance with FASB Concepts Statement No. 6,
	Elements of Financial Statements, and, therefore, recognition of those lease assets and lease liabilities represents an improvement
	over previous GAAP, which did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. For public business

	that private companies are able to forgo a preferability assessment the first time they elect the accounting alternatives within

	Mr.&nbsp;David Xueling Li, CEO, Mr.&nbsp;Jun Lei, Chairman of the Company, Mr.&nbsp;Tony Bin Zhao, Mr.&nbsp;Jin Cao and Beijing
	Tuda own approximately 0.5%, 0.44%, 0.04%, 0.02% and 99% of Guangzhou Huaduo&rsquo;s equity interests, respectively.

	Guangzhou Huaduo holds the licenses
	and permits necessary to conduct its internet value-added services and online advertising in the PRC. If the Company had direct
	ownership of the VIE, it would be able to exercise its rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors, which
	in turn could affect changes at the management level, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations. However, under the current
	contractual arrangements, it relies on the VIE and its shareholders&rsquo; performance of their contractual obligations to exercise
	effective control. In addition, the Group&rsquo;s contractual agreements have terms range from 10 to 30 years, which are subject
	to Beijing Huanju Shidai&rsquo;s unilateral termination right. Under the respective service agreements, Beijing Huanju Shidai will
	provide services including technology support, technology services, business support and consulting services to Guangzhou Huaduo
	in exchange for service fees. The amount of service fees payable is determined by various factors, including (a)&nbsp;a percentage
	of Guangzhou Huaduo&rsquo;s revenues or earnings, and (b)&nbsp;the expenses that Beijing Huanju Shidai incurs for providing such
	services. Beijing Huanju Shidai may charge up to 100% of the income in Guangzhou Huaduo and a multiple of the expenses incurred
	for providing such services, as determined by Beijing Huanju Shidai from time to time. The service fees payable by Guangzhou Huaduo
	to Beijing Huanju Shidai are determined to be up to 100% of the profits of Guangzhou Huaduo, with the timing of such payment to
	be determined at the sole discretion of Beijing Huanju Shidai. If fees were incurred, it would be significant to the Company and
	the operating companies&rsquo; economic performance because it will be incurred and paid at up to 100% of the earnings of the VIE.
	Fees incurred would be remitted, subject to further PRC restrictions. None of the VIEs or their shareholders are entitled to terminate
	the contracts prior to the expiration date, unless under remote circumstances such as a material breach of agreement or bankruptcy
	as it pertains to the service and business operation agreements and their amendment. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013,
	2014 and 2015, Guangzhou Huanju Shidai and Beijing Huanju Shidai determined that service fees of RMB31,153, RMB363,117 and RMB274,285
	were charged to Guangzhou Huaduo. The service fees are typically determined based on the costs and expenses that WOFEs incurs for
	providing relevant technology support to Guangzhou Huaduo, as well as the consideration of Guangzhou Huaduo&rsquo;s future business
	development plan and its increasingly growing and diverse operational needs.

	Further, the Group believes that
	the contractual arrangements among Beijing Huanju Shidai and Bilin Changxiang, the VIEs, and their shareholders are in compliance
	with PRC law and are legally enforceable. However, the PRC government may issue from time to time new laws or new interpretations
	on existing laws to regulate this industry. Regulatory risk also encompasses the interpretation by the tax authorities of current
	tax laws, and the Group&rsquo;s legal structure and scope of operations in the PRC, which could be subject to further restrictions
	resulting in limitations on the Company&rsquo;s ability to conduct business in the PRC. The PRC government may also require the
	Group to restructure the Group&rsquo;s operations entirely if it finds that its contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable
	laws and regulations. Furthermore, it could revoke the Group&rsquo;s business and operating licenses, require it to discontinue
	or restrict its operations, restrict its right to collect revenues, block its website, require it to restructure its operations,
	impose additional conditions or requirements with which the Group may not be able to comply, or take other regulatory or enforcement
	actions against the Group that could be harmful to its business. The imposition of any of these penalties may result in a material
	and adverse effect on the Group&rsquo;s ability to conduct the Group&rsquo;s business. In addition, if the imposition of any of
	these penalties causes the Group to lose the rights to direct the activities of the VIEs or the right to receive their economic
	benefits, the Group would no longer be able to consolidate the VIEs and VIE&rsquo;s subsidiaries. The Group does not believe that
	any penalties imposed or actions taken by the PRC government would result in the liquidation of the Company, Beijing Huanju Shidai
	and Bilin Changxiang, and the VIEs.

	On
	January 19, 2015, the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC, or (the &ldquo;MOFCOM&rdquo;) released on its Website for public comment
	a proposed PRC law (the &ldquo;Draft FIE Law&rdquo;) that appears to include VIEs within the scope of entities that could be considered
	to be foreign invested enterprises (or &ldquo;FIEs&rdquo;) that would be subject to restrictions under existing PRC law on foreign
	investment in certain categories of industry. Specifically, the Draft FIE Law introduces the concept of &ldquo;actual control&rdquo;
	for determining whether an entity is considered to be an FIE. In addition to control through direct or indirect ownership or equity,
	the Draft FIE Law includes control through contractual arrangements within the definition of &ldquo;actual control.&rdquo; If the
	Draft FIE Law is passed by the People&rsquo;s Congress of the PRC and goes into effect in its current form, these provisions regarding
	control through contractual arrangements could be construed to reach the Group&rsquo;s VIE arrangements, and as a result the Group&rsquo;s
	VIEs could become explicitly subject to the current restrictions on foreign investment in certain categories of industry. The Draft
	FIE Law includes provisions that would exempt from the definition of foreign invested enterprises entities where the ultimate controlling
	shareholders are either entities organized under PRC law or individuals who are PRC citizens. The Draft FIE Law does not make clear
	how &ldquo;control&rdquo; would be determined for such purpose, and is silent as to what type of enforcement action might be taken
	against existing VIEs that operate in restricted industries and are not controlled by entities organized under PRC law or individuals
	who are PRC citizens. If a finding were made by PRC authorities, under existing law and regulations or under the Draft FIE Law
	if it becomes effective, that the Group&rsquo;s operation of certain of its businesses through VIEs violates the Draft FIE Law,
	regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the licensing and operation of such operations and businesses may require the Group
	to take various actions as discussed in the paragraph above.
</FONT>
<FONT STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF">
	The
	Group&rsquo;s management considers the possibility of such a finding by PRC regulatory authorities under the Draft VIE law, if
	it becomes effective, to be remote.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and
	2015, substantially all of the Group&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits were placed with the PRC and international
	financial institutions. Management chooses these institutions because of their reputations and track records for stability, and
	their known large cash reserves, and management periodically reviews these institutions&rsquo; reputations, track records, and
	reported reserves. Management expects that any additional institutions that the Group uses for its cash and bank deposits will
	be chosen with similar criteria for soundness. Nevertheless under the PRC law, it is required that a commercial bank in the PRC
	that holds third party cash deposits should maintain a certain percentage of total customer deposits taken in a statutory reserve
	fund for protecting the depositors&rsquo; rights over their interests in deposited money. PRC banks are subject to a series of
	risk control regulatory standards; PRC bank regulatory authorities are empowered to take over the operation and management of any
	PRC bank that faces a material credit crisis. The Group believes that it is not exposed to unusual risks as these financial institutions
	are either PRC banks or international banks with high credit quality. The Group had not experienced any losses on its deposits
	of cash and cash equivalents and term deposits during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and believes that its

	The agreements for the acquisition
	of 100 Online included a contingent consideration arrangement that required additional consideration to be paid by the Group based
	on the actual net profit of 100 Online for years 2015 through 2017 as compared to the pre-established performance metrics as stipulated
	in the agreements. The undiscounted amounts the Company shall pay when the net profit of 100 Online from 2015 through 2017 equals
	to 100% of the performance metrics is RMB240 million. The actual contingent payments would be adjusted based on the degree of how
	the actual net profit is higher or lower than the performance metrics from 2015 through 2017. The fair value of the contingent
	consideration recognized on the acquisition date of RMB183 million was determined by the Company using the Trinomial Tree model.
	Under this model, the Company performs scenario analysis by assuming different scenarios under which 100 Online achieves different
	actual net profit for years 2015 through 2017. Under different scenarios, the amount of contingent consideration differs according
	to the stipulation in the agreements. The Company then calculated the fair value of the contingent consideration based on the net
	present value of the total contingent consideration under different scenarios and the expected probability of each scenario. Please
	refer to note 25 for the key parameters adopted in the valuation.

	The agreements for the acquisition
	of Beifu included a contingent consideration arrangement that required additional consideration to be paid by the Group based on
	the achievement of pre-established performance metrics as stipulated in the agreements for years 2015 through 2017. The undiscounted
	amounts the Company shall pay when Beifu achieves 100% of the performance metrics from 2015 through 2017 is RMB219 million. The
	actual contingent payments would be adjusted based on the degree of how the actual revenue and net profit are higher or lower than
	the performance metrics from 2015 through 2017. The fair value of the contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date
	of RMB107 million was determined by the Company using the Trinomial Tree model. Under this model, the Company performs scenario
	analysis by assuming different scenarios under which Beifu achieves different performance for years 2015 through 2017. Under different
	scenarios, the amount of contingent consideration differs according to the stipulation in the agreements. The Company then calculated
	the fair value of the contingent consideration based on the net present value of the total contingent consideration under different
	scenarios and the expected probability of each scenario. Please refer to note 25 for the key parameters adopted in the valuation.

	The

	specified performance metrics and did not complete an initial public offering, and the founders of Beifu remained being employed
	by the Company, the non-controlling shareholders had the right to put their equity interests in Beifu to the Company at the fair
	value (&ldquo;the put option&rdquo;).

	Valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when the Group determines that it is
	more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized in the future. In making such determination, the Group considered
	factors including future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and tax loss carry forwards. Valuation allowance
	was provided for net operating loss carry forward because it was more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be
	realized based on the Group&rsquo;s estimate of its future taxable income. If events occur in the future that allow the Group to

	The Company completed a business combination

	Under the arrangements entered into by
	the Company and the Employee, the Employee has been granted 20% of Xingxue&rsquo;s equity interests with immediate effect and will
	be entitled to purchase additional equity interests of Xingxue subject to the achievement of certain financial performance metrics
	of Xingxue (&ldquo;call option&rdquo;). These awards should be regarded as share based awards with performance conditions. The
	Company should recognize compensation cost for awards with performance conditions if and when the Company concludes that it is
	probable that the performance condition will be achieved. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on the Company&rsquo;s
	assessment on the probability of performance condition affiliated in this equity-classified award under ASC 718, the Company has
	recognised share based compensation of RMB32,593 for the share based awards granted to the Employee including the initial 20% of
	shares and the additional shares to be granted under the call option.

	Fair value reflects the price

	at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded

	that is significant to the fair value measurement. This guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques, which is based
	on whether the inputs into the valuation technique are observable or unobservable. The hierarchy is as follows:

	The fair value guidance describes
	three main approaches to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1)&nbsp;market approach; (2)&nbsp;income approach and
	(3)&nbsp;cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving
	identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single
	present value amount. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.
	The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset.

	parameters, such as interest rates and currency rates. The Group did not have any other financial instruments that were required

	the change is due to additional information about facts already existed at the acquisition date, these changes should be regarded
	as resulting from events after the acquisition date and do not constitute measurement period adjustments. Therefore, the second
	category will be applied to the Company. The Company will re-measure the fair value of the liability recognized for the contingent
	consideration at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded

	Relevant PRC laws and regulations
	permit payments of dividends by the Group&rsquo;s subsidiaries and the VIEs and VIE&rsquo;s subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC
	only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition,
	the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries and the VIEs and VIE&rsquo;s subsidiaries in the PRC are required to annually appropriate 10%
	of their net after-tax income to the statutory general reserve fund prior to payment of any dividends, unless such reserve funds
	have reached 50% of their respective registered capital. As a result of these and other restrictions under PRC laws and regulations,
	the Group&rsquo;s subsidiaries and the VIEs and VIE&rsquo;s subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are restricted in their ability
	to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company either in the form of dividends, loans or advances, which restricted portion
	as calculated under U.S.&nbsp;GAAP amounted to approximately RMB343,090 and RMB2,685,373 as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015,
	respectively. There are no differences between U.S.&nbsp;GAAP and PRC accounting standards in connection with the reported net
	assets of the legally owned subsidiaries in the PRC and the VIEs and VIE&rsquo;s subsidiaries. Even though the Company currently
	does not require any such dividends, loans or advances from the PRC entities for working capital and other funding purposes, the
	Company may in the future require additional cash resources from them due to changes in business conditions, to fund future acquisitions
	and development, or merely to declare and pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders. Except for the above, there is no
	other restriction on use of proceeds generated by the Group&rsquo;s subsidiaries and the VIEs and VIE&rsquo;s subsidiaries to satisfy
